H. Green. ${ }^{1}$ Exactly what that role is, however, its scope and limitations, its explanation and Justification-indeed, what retribution itself is-have continued to be so controversial that it is difficult to think of a single retributivist doctrine or thesis that has not been challenged or rejected in the course of explaining or defending a retributivist theory of punishment. In recent years, this confusion has continued alongside the growing popularity in many quarters of retributive ideas, a popularity owing as much to despair over prevention and rehabilitation in our current system of criminal justice as to enthusiasm for retribution. Two decades ago, it seemed not implausible to declare that "retribution is obsolete." ${ }^{2}$ Within a few years, however, it was staging a revival of sorts in England. ${ }^{3}$ Now, it is visibly advocated\n\n[^0] [^0]: \\* To be presented in an apa symposium on the New Retributivism, December 27, 1978.

It behooves us to look once again at its distinctive features and to come to terms with them.\n\nA decade ago, H. L. A. Hart offered a model of the retributive theory of punishment; despite its usefulness and availability, it seems to have been ignored in the subsequent formulations and criticisms of retributivist theories. ${ }^{6}$ I propose to use it here as the focus for discussion. According to Hart, ${ }^{7}$ a retributive theory of punishment involves, at a minimum, three tenets (231): $\\mathrm{R}_{1}$ : A person may be punished if and only if he has voluntarily done something wrong. $\\mathrm{R}_{2}$ : The punishment must match, or be equivalent to, the wickedness of the offense. $\\mathrm{R}_{3}$ : The justification for punishing persons is that the return of\n\nUniversity Press, 1966), reprinted in revised and abbreviated form in his Sentencing in a Rational Society (New York: Basic Books, 1971), pp. 1-22; the development may be traced in H.

Parenthetical page references to von Hirsch (see esp. sec. III) will be to this book. Von Hirsch prefers not to have his view called "retribution" because this is not "a helpful term" (45). The introduction to his book, however, is written by colleagues who do not shrink from attributing to society and to themselves a "retributive purpose" in punishment (xxxix). ${ }^{5}$ Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae, Fowler v.

I shall begin by considering this model from the standpoint of the theory of punishment and some of the criticisms to which it is open from this direction (section 1). Then, after considering the model\'s apparent omission of the concept of desert (section II), I shall turn to evaluating some recent attempts to explicate the principle of proportionality (section III). Finally, I shall examine attempts to construct a purely retributive theory of punishment that manages to avoid familiar objections to the principle of just requital (section iv). Although I shall have a good deal to say about $R_{2}$ and $R_{3}$, I shall have little to say about $R_{1}$. Whereas Hart introduces his model retributive theory mainly in order to consider various "modifications of the model" (233), I shall ignore these modifications, though they are not without interest, because they do not bear on the criticisms I shall consider. I have elsewhere undertaken to examine the retributive theory and have argued for several concessions to it. ${ }^{9}$ To that extent, I suppose, I am myself a retributivist, much to my surprise. With one exception below (section III) I shall try not to retrace any of that ground here.\n\n# I\n\nHart claimed that $\\mathbf{R}_{1}-\\mathbf{R}_{3}$ constitute retributivist answers to "all the main questions to which a theory of punishment is addressed" (231). But what are these questions, and why are they all and only "the main questions"? Hart seems not to have worried about this. All he had to say on the concept of a theory of punishment is that such theories are not theories "in any ordinary sense" of that term because they are made up mostly of "moral claims as to what justi-\n\n[^0] [^0]: ${ }^{8}$ In an earlier paper, "Prolegomenon to the Principles of Punishment" (1959), Hart had described what amounts to $\\mathbf{R}_{1}$ as the principle of "retribution in distribution"; subsequent commentators have usually discussed it under this heading. See Hart, op. cit., p. 9. ${ }^{9}$ See my "Concessions to Retribution in Punishment," in J. B. Cederblom and William L. Blizek, eds., Justice and Punishment (Cambridge, Mass.: Ballinger, 1977), pp. 51-74. After that paper was published, I discovered that Brand Blanshard had anticipated me with his own "Concessions to the Retributive Theory"; see the middle section of his "Retribution Revisited," in Edward H. Madden, Rollo Handy, and Marvin Farber, eds., Philosophical Perspectives on Punishment (Springfield, Ill.: Charles C Thomas, 1968), pp. 59-81. A reader of both papers will discover that none of Blanshard\'s concessions were among those I made.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 4 ~</p>\n\nfies the practice of punishment," and they are "independent of any question of fact or evidence." ${ }^{10}$ Theories in the proper or ordinary sense of that term, Hart implied, do not exhibit either of these traits. Today, such starkly positivistic views about the nature of theories are unfashionable, and it would be interesting to work out in detail a better general account of what a theory of punishment could and should be. Here, the most I can do in that regard is to sketch some suggestions in the course of trying to show that $\\mathrm{R}_{1}-\\mathrm{R}_{3}$ give us an incomplete model of retributive punishment.\n\nHart is surely right when he says that retribution, deterrence, and reformation are mainly "moral claims as to what justifies the practice of punishment." Still, when earlier philosophers, such as Green, undertook to determine (181) "whether punishment according to its proper nature is retributive or preventive or reformatory," is it so clear that the only important thing at issue was the justification of the practice of punishment? I think not. Surely, it is not implausible to think that part of what we want from a theory of punishment is an answer to the question, What is (the nature of) punishment? asked in a sense such that what counts as an answer, or part of the answer, is what we might call a definition of \'punishment\'. A subsidiary question under What is the nature of punishment? is, What sort of things must we do in order to punish a person? ${ }^{11}$ As etymology assures us, retribution involves the idea of someone\'s paying something back to someone else. So retributive punishment must embody the idea of something being paid back to the offender (or by the offender, or both)-something akin to what the crime did to its victim(s). The concept of a retributive punishment, therefore, is the concept of a punitive harm, suffering, or deprivation, because it is harm, suffering, or deprivation that the acts typically defined as crimes inflict on their victims. So we might consider amending the model to include the following: $A_{1}$ : Something imposed on a person counts as a punishment only if it is a harm or deprivation or causes suffering or pain to that person. Another question not satisfactorily answered by the model is, What makes a person liable and eligible for punishment? The\n\n[^0] [^0]: 10 "Murder and the Principles of Punishment" (1957), in Hart, op. cit., pp. 71-73. ${ }^{11}$ In the rest of this paragraph I borrow from my "A World without Punishment?" in Milton Goldinger, ed., Punishment and Human Rights (Cambridge, Mass.: Schenkman, 1974), pp. 152/3.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 5 ~</p>\n\nanswer is, Being guilty of an offense-a thesis sometimes called "logical retributivism" ${ }^{12}$ and widely argued during the past generation to be part of the nature of punishment. Some might read $\\mathbf{R}_{1}$ as though it already implies this idea and, thus, deny that the model needs amendment to include it. But such a reading of $\\mathbf{R}_{1}$ inconveniently collapses into a single thesis two quite independent ideas, each of which can properly be regarded as retributive in nature. One is that a person\'s liability and eligibility for punishment turns on whether he is guilty of an act subject to punishment. ${ }^{13}$ The other is that punishable acts should be confined to voluntary wrongdoing, in a sense of \'voluntary\' sufficient to exclude so-called "strict liability offenses." If $\\mathbf{R}_{1}$ is taken to express only this latter idea (and this seems to be how Hart understands it), then the following amendment would be in order: $A_{2}$ : A person is liable and eligible for punishment if and only if he is guilty of an offense.\n\nCertainly Hart and probably others would agree that $\\mathbf{A}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{A}_{2}$ express the nature of justified punishment, but they would not accept them as proper amendments to the model of retributivism. They would argue that $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ are part of the definition of \'punishment\' and, thus, being shared by all theories of punishment, are improperly incorporated into any. ${ }^{14}$ I would reply that ignoring $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ either unduly limits the idea of a theory of punishment to the justification of punishment, or forces us to deny that $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$ express retributive ideas. I find neither alternative attractive.\n\nThese difficulties, as well as other considerations, can be conveniently brought out by a closer consideration of the status of $\\mathbf{A}_{1}$. First, the reason a retributivist wants to impose harms as punish-\n\n[^0] [^0]: 12 T. S. Champlin, "Punishment without Offense," American Philosophical Quarterly, xim, 1 (January 1976): 85-87, p. 85. Champlin attributes the inspiration for this phrase to Antony Quinton, according to whom "the first principle of retributivism is that it is necessary that a man be guilty if he is to be punished," a thesis said to be "an elucidation of the use of the word" \'punishment\' and, thus, a "necessity . . . not moral but logical." Quinton, "On Punishment" (1954), reprinted in Acton, ed., op. cit., pp. 55-64. ${ }^{13}$ Throughout, I ignore complications arising from whether it is legal or moral wrong, or both, that is at issue, and whether it is guilt or being found guilty that qualifies a person for punishment. 14 Thus, Hart defines punishment so that it "must involve pain or other consequences normally considered unpleasant" (roughly equivalent to $A_{1}$ ) and "must be for an offense against legal rules" (roughly equivalent to $A_{2}$ ). See his "Prolegomenon to the Principles of Punishment" (1959), reprinted in Hart, op. cit., pp. 4/5.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 6 ~</p>\n\nments, rather than pleasures or something else, is not the reason the utilitarian has for doing the same thing. The utilitarian who believes in prevention and deterrence threatens and imposes harms as punishment in order to provide a disincentive to prohibited conduct. As for the believer in reform, it is not obvious that he thinks the concept of punishment is necessarily the concept of something harmful in itself. If the reformer really is defending a theory of punishment, rather than (as sometimes he seems to be) advocating an alternative to punishment, it may be that what he favors imposing on persons as their punishment is never chosen because he believes that it is harmful. If so, then it is false to assume that all the classic theories of punishment presuppose the same neutral definition of \'punishment\'. The considerations here are parallel to those which arise in the discussion of civil disobedience. It is quite clear now, even if it was not some years ago, that the definition of \'civil disobedience\' is not altogether independent of the justification of civil disobedience. ${ }^{15}$ So with \'punishment\' and the justification of punishment.\n\nSecond, although Hart writes as if he has identified in $\\mathbf{R}_{1}-\\mathbf{R}_{3}$ three theses unique to retributivism, this is not entirely consistent with what he writes elsewhere, and is in any case doubtful. Hart quite rightly makes much of the fact that the principle of responsibility ( $\\mathrm{R}_{1}$ ) needs neither to be based primarily on retributive ideas nor to be taken to express them. Instead, it can be seen as an expression of "the simple idea that unless a man has the capacity and a fair opportunity or chance to adjust his behavior to the law its penalties ought not to be applied to him" (181). Likewise with the principle of proportionality ( $\\mathrm{R}_{2}$ ); Hart notes that the most plausible interpretation of this principle may turn it into a doctrine that the utilitarian will find attractive (234). Thus, Hart himself shows how nonretributivists may find that they, too, want to defend these elements of the retributive theory. So, even if some nonretributivists would want to defend $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$, Hart cannot for that reason argue that they are not part of the retributive theory. What nonretributivists must reject, of course, is the principle of just requital $\\left(R_{3}\\right)$, and, if they accept $A_{1}$, it must be on a different ground from that of the retributivist.\n\nGiven this, the adequacy of the model Hart formulates for the purposes of understanding the retributive theory cannot rest on\n\n[^0] [^0]: 15 See John Rawls, A Theory of Justice (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard, 1971), 55 55-59; Peter Singer, Democracy and Disobedience (New York: Oxford, 1973); Burton Zwiebach, Civility and Disobedience (New York: Cambridge, 1975).\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 7 ~</p>\n\nthe claim that no nonretributive theory incorporates any of $\\mathbf{R}_{1}-\\mathbf{R}_{8}$. It must rest, rather, on the fact that (a) all the many variants of the retributive theory can be conveniently formulated through revisions and amendments to $\\mathbf{R}_{1}-\\mathbf{R}_{3}$, and (b) no nonretributive theory can incorporate all three of these theses. Adding $\\mathbf{A}_{1}$ to the model does not affect (a) and (b); it thus leaves intact the chief merits of the original model. What holds for $A_{1}$ in this regard holds also for $\\mathbf{A}_{2}$. Conversely, the explicit denial of $\\mathbf{A}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{A}_{2}$ by a retributivist is virtually inconceivable; they play as essential a role to any possible retributivist theory of punishment as do any of $\\mathrm{R}_{1}-\\mathrm{R}_{3}$.\n\nLet us return to the "main questions" to which the theory of punishment is addressed. As Hart saw them, they were three: "\'What sort of conduct may be punished?\', \'How severely?\', and \'What is the justification for the punishment?\'" (231). Are there other elements of a complete theory of punishment, however, that $\\mathbf{R}_{1}-\\mathbf{R}_{3}$ fail to provide, other "main questions" (like the question, What is the nature of punishment?) that Hart has ignored or rejected? He waffles a bit, ${ }^{16}$ and it is difficult to knqw what to say because we have no firm grasp on the idea of a complete theory of punishment. It is easy enough to think of other questions about punishment whose answers are not given or implied by the answers to the three questions Hart identifies, questions that other philosophers have tried to answer: Who may inflict punishment? Why do we want to punish and (insofar as we do) want to be punished? Under what conditions does a system of victim compensation by offenders count as a mode of punishment rather than an alternative to punishment? Are there any moral considerations that decisively rule against certain modes of punishment (e.g., corporal or incarcerative punishments)? What constitutes the severity of a punishment? What social functions does a system of punishment actually perform? What social costs are reasonable to incur in order to obtain the benefits of an efficient system of punishment?\n\n[^0] [^0]: 16 Consider his remarks on the questions, Why do men punish? (74) and Who may be punished? (11). The context implies that the first question is best left for social scientists to answer. As for the second question, one might argue (though Hart does not) that it can be dropped in favor of Hart\'s first "main question," viz., What sort of conduct may be punished?, because an answer to the latter will guarantee an answer to the former. One might also wonder whether this is true, however. Unless the capacities underlying "voluntary conduct" are necessarily tied to the capacity to understand threats, to deliberate over selfish advantage, and so forth, it might be that various classes of infrapersons are conceivable objects of punishment even though their conduct does not make them eligible for punishment under $\\mathbf{R}_{4}$.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 8 ~</p>\n\nWhat is required to justify the punishment of this offender for this crime in this manner? Perhaps philosophers, out of a healthy respect for a division of intellectual labor between themselves and social scientists, need not trouble with most of these (empirical? normative? merely administrative?) questions. But we cannot claim to understand the practice of punishment unless we are ready with answers to all these questions; and if the social philosopher\'s job is to understand and justify the basic structure of social institutions, surely he will find that the criminal justice system is among them, and then any or all of these questions may well fall within his purview.\n\nDoes a retributivist have answers to all these questions, even if his answers cannot be extracted from $R_{1}-R_{3}$ ? Certainly there are some questions to which he does not have an answer, and to which the answer seems indifferent to his theory (e.g., Who may inflict punishment?). For some other questions, however, there are retributivists who will be ready with an answer. Some retributivists believe that we want to punish the guilty, or want to be assured that someone will undertake to punish them, because in that way we purge ourselves of feelings of vicarious resentment; and that, where we are ourselves the victims of crime, we want the offender punished out of revenge. (As James Fitzjames Stephen once said, punishment stands to revenge as marriage does to lust.) Without trying to examine and answer all these questions, we can say that retributivism is not a complete theory of punishment if we identify the retributive theory with $R_{1}-R_{3}$ (or even with $R_{1}-R_{3}$ plus $A_{1}-$ $\\mathrm{A}_{2}$ ) and if a complete theory is one that states or implies an answer to every serious question that arises in the theory and practice of punishment; and that $R_{1}-R_{3}$ is an adequate model of the retributive theory only to the extent that it gives answers to some of the main questions about punishment.\n\n# II\n\nHart\'s model of the retributive theory of punishment is open, it appears, to a major objection, which goes like this. Retributivism without desert-the concept of punishment as something deserved by whoever is rightly made liable to it-is like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark. Hart\'s model ignores desert; none of $R_{1}-R_{3}$ is expressly formulated in terms of this concept. The model is, therefore, at best insufficient for a discussion of retributive punishment.\n\nThere are at least two ways of replying to this criticism. One is to concede both its contentions (that desert is essential to the retributive theory and that Hart\'s model omits desert, or at best\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 9 ~</p>\n\nincludes it only tacitly), and undertake to remedy the model by supplementing it in some way or other in order to introduce the idea of desert. The other is to grant that Hart\'s model does omit the idea of desert, but then insist that this omission does not matter because it is not true that desert is essential to retributivism in contrast to other theories of punishment. Let us look more closely at each of these lines of response.\n\nThe first alternative admits of several variations. One would be to reformulate one or more of $R_{1}-R_{3}$ in terms of desert, e.g., to transform the principle of responsibility into a principle of desert, to read "Harm is deserved as punishment if and only if it is done to someone who has voluntarily done wrong." Such a transformation could be said, with a little charity, to capture the essential idea that a person\'s desert is always uniquely determined by reference to things that he did and that are, now, behind him, in the past. ${ }^{17}$ Or one might leave all of $R_{1}-R_{3}$ intact and add a further thesis whose sole function would be to introduce the missing idea of desert. Some such thesis as the following would do: $R_{4}$ : Punishment is deserved by a person only if it is imposed by reference to his culpable acts or omissions, and the punishment he deserves is determined by the principle of proportionality $\\left(R_{2}\\right)$.\n\nYet another possibility would be to assert that $R_{1}-R_{2}$ constitute the meaning of, or the truth conditions for, deserved punishment. Each tactic has its inelegancies, and each results in a slightly different sense of \'desert\' as well. But the general idea in each case is clear enough, and one or the other should be sufficient for the purpose. As for the possibility that desert is already implicitly in Hart\'s model as he formulates it, we should note that he manages the unusual feat of conducting his discussion of the retributive theory without once mentioning or using \'desert\' or any synonym for it. ${ }^{18}$ Surely this suggests that he does not think desert is central or peculiar to this theory of punishment at all.\n\nThe second alternative presents us with at least two variants that need to be canvassed. One is the sweeping view that the class\n\n[^0] [^0]: 17 Feinberg, "Justice and Personal Desert" (1963), reprinted in his Doing and Deserving (Princeton: University Press, 1970), pp. 56-61; Kleinig, "The Concept of Desert," American Philosophical Quarterly, vili, 1 (January 1971): 71-78. ${ }^{18}$ An exception to this generalization may be found in Hart, op. cit., p. 181. Nigel Walker\'s very useful discussion of the retributive theory also is conducted without emphasis on the concept of desert; see Walker, op. cit., supra, in 3.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 10 ~</p>\n\nof deserved punishments on any theory of punishment is coextensive with the class of punishments that the theory justifies, because the concept of deserved punishment is identical with the concept of justified punishment. With such a concept of desert, deserved punishment is no longer unique to the theory of retributive punishment. But this is not a plausible concept of desert. On a more plausible view, such as that sketched above, nonretributivists are likely to argue that not only are the concepts of deserved punishment and of justified punishment nonidentical, there is a (small) class of persons who deserve to be punished but for whom punishment is unjustified, and perhaps even a (small) class of persons for whom punishment is justified but not because they deserve it. The retributivist, of course, will not allow such inexact overlap; and this is why he is not likely to favor this alternative. Yet there is another possibility here. Suppose we were to say that a person deserves to be punished if and only if he brought the punishment on himself by knowingly and intentionally violating a positive law that justly protects the rights of others. ${ }^{19}$ This notion of desert goes beyond the narrow idea of liability to lawful punishment $\\left(\\mathrm{A}_{2}\\right)$ as well as beyond the principle of responsibility $\\left(\\mathrm{R}_{1}\\right)$. It is a modified retributive idea to the extent that it incorporates $R_{1}$, but goes beyond this principle though not in the direction of $R_{2}$ or $R_{3}$. Moreover, since the appeal to just laws which it adds to $R_{1}-R_{3}$ is not a retributive notion, it could be accepted by a retributivist as expressing an idea of desert suitable to his theory but not unique to it; and thus by adopting this idea he need not criticize the adequacy of $R_{1}-R_{3}$ as a retributive model.\n\nThus, we have several different ways to cope with the omission of desert from our model of the retributive theory, as well as three different ideas of desert to choose among. I shall not try to decide which is the best way to solve the problem of incorporating desert into the model. I do assume that our picture of retributivism is unsatisfactory until we solve this problem.\n\nAs soon as we have settled the place of desert in the retributive theory, the theory seems to be open to one or the other of two familiar and powerful criticisms. One is that no one ever deserves to be punished, or deserves the punishment he gets. The other is that, although it is true that sometimes persons deserve to be punished, and perhaps even deserve the punishment they get, no\n\n[^0] [^0]: 19 Compare W. C. Kneale, "The Responsibility of Criminals" (1967), reprinted in Acton, ed., op. cit., p. 184. Kneale, however, seems to think that this notion of desert is wholly nonretributive.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 11 ~</p>\n\none knows or could know for certain what that deserved punishment is and on what grounds it is deserved. In either case, the point of the criticism is to undermine any confidence we might have in punishing someone by appeal to what he deserves.\n\nHow the retributivist responds to these objections will depend in part on how he has incorporated desert into his theory, and in part on what concept of desert he uses. Because it is possible to have a notion of desert, as we have seen, which is not unique to retributivism, the criticism we are now considering can be understood as an attack upon any theory of punishment, and not only on the account of deserved punishment peculiar to the retributivist. If, however, these criticisms are to be directed exclusively to the retributive theory and its notions of desert, then it is likely that part of what is under attack is also the retributivist\'s principle for constructing the penalty schedule ( $\\mathrm{R}_{2}$ ). For the retributivist must attempt to ground his judgments about the kind and severity of punishments offenders deserve by appeal to his principle of proportionality ( $\\mathrm{R}_{2}$ ). Thus, the retributivist\'s reply to the skeptical challenge above will ultimately involve a defense not only of desert but of $\\mathrm{R}_{2}$ as well.\n\nIII Traditionally, the greatest objection to the retributivist is that his principle of proportionality, $\\mathbf{R}_{2}$, results in a dilemma. Either $\\mathbf{R}_{2}$ is interpreted according to lex talionis, in which case either it is taken strictly with absurd results (e.g., should we punish a rapist by raping him? his wife or daughter?) or it is taken loosely or found to be inapplicable altogether (e.g., how can we punish a kidnapper according to lex talionis, if he has no children of his own?). Or $\\mathbf{R}_{2}$ is not interpreted according to lex talionis at all, in which case either it yields arbitrary results or it goes off into wholly nonretributive ideas of how punishments are to be deemed proportional to crimes. How do retributivists now meet this challenge? There are only two recent attempts worth examining, so far as I know, and neither is satisfactory. ${ }^{20}$\n\nOne is by Claudia Card, in which she in effect interprets $\\mathbf{R}_{2}$ in terms of what she calls "The Penalty Principle." This principle states in part that a punishment is retributively just only if it imposes on an offender a deprivation of rights to the extent of his "evident culpable failure to abide by the law" and-what she calls the "Full Measure Principle"-"the hardship to which he is thus\n\n[^0] [^0]: 20 The rest of this section is a revision of section vi of my "Concessions to Retribution in Punishment," op. cit., supra, fn 9.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 12 ~</p>\n\nexposed . . . does not exceed the worst that anyone could reasonably expect to suffer from the similar conduct of another if such conduct were to become general in the community." ${ }^{21}$ The Penalty Principle incorporates the idea that wrongdoing is a function of two independent components: a factor internal to the offender, namely mens rea, malicious intentions, motives, or reasons for inflicting (or attempting to inflict) culpable injury on others; and a factor external to the offender, namely the harm caused the victim(s). We could, perhaps, imagine a retributivism that built its principle of proportionality around only one of these ideas, but that is not Card\'s view, and it is not the way most retributivists (including Hart) would interpret $\\mathrm{R}_{2}$. The chief difficulties arise, as Card herself recognizes, over interpreting the "Full Measure Principle." "The Full Measure consists in a deprivation of rights exposing the offender to a hardship comparable in severity to the worst that anyone could reasonably be expected to suffer from the similar conduct of another if such conduct were to become general in the community" (27). The purpose of this principle is to explicate the intuitively sound requirement of retributivism, that a just punishment consists in "a suspension or withdrawal of rights of the offender corresponding to his failure to respect such rights of others" (32). To apply this principle and identify a punishment as just or deserved for a given crime or for an offender who is guilty of that crime, we must have some way of measuring the hardship or loss of rights suffered by the victim. Consider the crime of rape. How much hardship would this crime involve were it to become general in the community? What would we undertake to examine in order to assess and measure that hardship? Would it be the victim\'s feelings, such as how much the assault hurt, or the victim\'s reactions, such as the subsequent self-imposed restrictions on freedom of movement, or the victim\'s judgments, such as the loss of self-esteem? Would the hardship take into account the victim\'s status, such as whether she was a child, a prostitute, a spouse, or other effects upon the victim, such as her prior virginity or subsequent pregnancy? Which are to be excluded as irrelevant hardships, and how are the re-\n\n[^0] [^0]: 21 "Retributive Penal Liability," American Philosophical Quarterly Monographs, No. 7 (1973), pp. 22/3. Parenthetical page references to Card will be to this monograph. Her Penalty Principle as she gives it in its complete form contains a third clause which introduces the component of deterrence. For an argument (though not with reference to Card) that it is impossible to construct a penalty scale built consistently on some combination of retributive and deterrent factors, see Alan Wertheimer, "Should Punishment Fit the Crime?" Social Theory and Practice, III, 4 (Fall 1975): 403-423.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 13 ~</p>\n\nmainder to be integrated? Card does not tell us, and so we do not know what would be the appropriate degree or kind of suffering to legislate for the generality of rapists "comparable to the worst that anyone could reasonably be expected to suffer" were rape to become general in the community. I doubt, in fact, whether we have any clear idea of how to take even the first steps to solve this problem.\n\nThe other alternative is offered by Andrew von Hirsch, in what he calls "the principle of commensurate deserts." According to this principle, "Severity of punishment should be commensurate with the seriousness of the wrong . . Seriousness depends both on harm done (or risked) by the act, and on the degree of the actor\'s culpability" ( 66,69 ). This principle is virtually a paraphrase of $\\mathbf{R}_{2}$, and so leads directly to the familiar problems. (a) Although there may be little difficulty in making uniform judgments of ordinal culpability (e.g., his killing was more culpable than her killing, because she was provoked and he wasn\'t) or of ordinal harmfulness (e.g., her theft was more harmful than his, because she stole their car and he stole their typewriter), there is no unique nonarbitrary way to combine these judgments into one judgment of ordinal seriousness. (b) Even if that problem is solved, and even if a plausible penalty scale can be constructed in terms of ordinal severity (e.g., his punishment is twice as severe as hers, because he served two years behind bars and she served only one), there is no unique non-arbitrary way to identify the severity of the appropriate punishment, given only the seriousness of the crime, as $\\mathbf{R}_{2}$ requires. How does von Hirsch respond to these difficulties?\n\nHe shows that he is aware of these problems, but the solution he offers is inadequate. He relies on the Sellin-Wolfgang techniques for measuring degrees of gravity of offenses, ${ }^{22}$ but, unfortunately, ignores the fact that these scientists had no interest in anything approximating his principle of commensurate deserts. His idea, crucial to $\\mathbf{R}_{2}$ and to standard versions of retributivism, that we can make sense of fitting punishments to crimes and criminals by analyzing the gravity of the criminal act into two components, agent culpability and victim suffering, is not only not investigated by Sellin and Wolfgang; by implication they repudiate it as unscientific and irrelevant.\n\nSellin and Wolfgang undertake to rank-order criminal offenses\n\n[^0] [^0]: 22 Thorsten Sellin and Marvin E. Wolfgang, The Measurement of Delinquency (New York: John Wiley, 1964). Parenthetical page references to Sellin and Wolfgang are to this book.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 14 ~</p>\n\naccording to the degree of severity, and they do this by means of a scale with twenty-six equal intervals on which they plot judgments from a large sample of persons reflecting their assessment of amount and relative degree of harm done by a wide range of crimes. At one end of their scale is the least serious crime (larceny in the amount of $\\$ 1$ ), and at the other end the most serious crime (murder) (289). Armed robbery of $\\$ 5$ turns out to be five times as serious as the least serious crime; forcible rape turns out to be two and a half times as serious as armed robbery of $\\$ 5$. Their rating scale has various implausible consequences, owing in part to deliberate simplifications. For example, they conclude that the harm caused in a crime that costs the victim his one good eye is equivalent in seriousness to the harm that results in a crushed rib without accompanying lung puncture. Their reason is that neither injury can be treated merely with first aid, neither results in death of the victim, and both require hospitalization (191). Their scales also provide no way to discriminate among different forms of criminal homicide (e.g., murder vs. manslaughter, willful murder vs. felony murder) because their theory does not include any way to identify and factor in separately aggravating and mitigating circumstances once it has been determined that the crime results in the victim\'s death. ${ }^{38}$ These and other results can all be viewed as consequences of their decision at the start to collapse the idea of an offense\'s seriousness into the harm it causes, thereby leaving out of account any role for the culpability factor. Their reason for this omission is that the offender\'s culpability is a property not of the offender\'s "act" but of the offender (248, 252, 258, 306), something which their theory is not intended to measure and which they imply is beyond scientific assessment.\n\nTo the extent, therefore, that von Hirsch relies only on the Sellin-Wolfgang methods to measure gravity of offenses, to that extent he neglects a factor that is part of $R_{2}$ and is usually thought to be one of the morally attractive features of the retributivist\'s penalty schedule. Independently of his reliance on the theory of Sellin-Wolfgang, von Hirsch allots only passing attention to the culpability factor, its identification, and its incorporation into his proposed penalty schedule. The only culpability factor he seems willing to measure and incorporate into the penalty scale is the number and seriousness of the offender\'s prior convictions. Other\n\n[^0] [^0]: ${ }^{38}$ Von Hirsch (139) indicates that his preferred penalty scale would be able to make such discriminations, and he indicates what they are. But since he does not rely on Sellin-Wolfgang to do so, and could not, he is left with incoherent empirical underpinnings for his principle of commensurate deserts.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 15 ~</p>\n\nfactors that might mitigate culpability are no more than mentioned in passing. ${ }^{24}$ Whatever else may be said, therefore, about his principle of commensurate deserts, it hardly is entitled to be viewed as a retributively adequate account of how to determine an offender\'s "just deserts."\n\nAs for the penalty schedule von Hirsch constructs in accordance with his principle (132-140), it does appear to be consistent with that principle. But it cannot be claimed to be implied by it. It would be an easy task to construct any of a dozen equally plausible penalty schedules simply by varying minimum or maximum terms of incarceration by slight amounts; each would be equally consistent with the "principle of commensurate deserts." The arbitrariness of the proposed schedule, therefore, is all too plain and further undercuts any claim that penalties derived from the schedule are an offender\'s "just deserts." ${ }^{25}$\n\nI conclude that, although justice does require us to adopt some principle of proportionality, this principle seems not to be very well expressed by $R_{2}$ or by the recent variants on it discussed above. The new retributivism thus fails at precisely the same point where the old retributivism did; it has yet to solve the dilemma of making the punishment fit the crime.\n\nIV This brings us to $\\mathrm{R}_{8}$, the principle of requital and the retributive justification of punishment. Many have followed Hart\'s lead in defending "retribution in distribution" ( $\\mathrm{R}_{1}$ ), distinguishing this from "retribution in general justifying aim" ( $\\mathrm{R}_{3}$ ), and then rejecting the latter in favor of the view that the chief aim and justification of a system of punishment is the reduction of crime. Von Hirsch, for example, in effect accepts both $R_{1}$ and $R_{2}$; but he rejects $R_{3}$ because he mentions as a virtual truism that "criminals should be punished so that there will be less crime" (37: cf. 47). I cannot think of any retributivist today who defends $\\mathbf{R}_{3}$; how could it be defended? It is, as Hart observed, "a mysterious piece of moral\n\n[^0] [^0]: 2460, 84-88. He mentions as mitigating factors altruistic motives (81) and provocations (100). ${ }^{25}$ To cite but one example, von Hirsch does not consider the possibility that the death penalty might be the "just deserts" for some crimes of murder, such as serial or multiple murders. He gives no argument that what he calls "the presumptive penalty" for murder should not be death, but only prison terms of more than five years (p. 139 note). This is one of the more vivid displays of his welcome bias in favor of penalties of lesser severity than those to be found under current systems of criminal justice. This leniency cannot be attributed to features of his theory, including the principle of commensurate deserts, however.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 16 ~</p>\n\nalchemy, in which the combination of the two evils of moral wickedness and suffering are transmuted into good" (234/5). Yet, if I am right (in section 1), $\\mathrm{R}_{3}$ is the most distinctive element in the retributive theory; it is the only thesis in the model that a nonretributivist must reject. More generally, one might say that the most interesting idea about punishment that a retributivist could hold is that the "general justifying aim" of punishment is nonconsequentialist and therefore nonutilitarian, that it is deontological, to be found within the theory of Right and not within the theory of Good. Are there, perhaps, alternatives to $\\mathrm{R}_{3}$ that might accomplish this in a satisfactory way? Here the retributivist encounters another familiar dilemma. Either he appeals to something else-some good end-that is accomplished by the practice of punishment, in which case he is open to the criticism that he has a nonretributivist, consequentialist justification for the practice of punishment. Or his justification does not appeal to something else, in which case it is open to the criticism that it is circular and futile. The first horn of the dilemma is illustrated when retributivists try to justify the practice of punishment by appeal to the socially cathartic, purgative, expiatory effect that the practice of punishment is alleged to have. The same difficulty attaches to the currently more popular variant that the system of punishment is justified by its authoritative role in denouncing as wrong the harmful conduct made liable to punishment-a dubious version, perhaps, of a retributive justifying general aim, and not in need of criticism here. ${ }^{26}$\n\nThe more interesting ways of avoiding the above dilemma are to be found in attempts to seize the second horn. One such view goes like this. Let us assume that we live in a just society. Even so, there might be some among us who at some point will voluntarily break the law and cause innocent persons harm. Why would it be reasonable on these assumptions to define offenses and set up punishments for their commission? Because to do anything less would be unfair to the law-abiding. By hypothesis, in a just society everyone has a right to whatever the system distributes to him under its rules, and no one has the right to violate the rules. Consequently, every violation of the rights of others, every crime, must be seen as an unjust act, in which the offender unfairly gains at the expense of his victims. He unfairly gains property in crimes\n\n[^0] [^0]: ${ }^{26}$ For a thorough discussion, see Walker, "Punishing, Denouncing or Reducing Crime?" forthcoming in the Festshrijt for Glanville Williams, edited by Peter Glazebrooke. I am grateful to Professor Walker for providing me with a prepublication copy of this essay. See also Hart, op. cit., p. 235.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 17 ~</p>\n\nof theft, and he gains the unfair exercise of his freedom in crimes of personal violence done for no further motive, such as murder and rape. Justice requires that these unfair advantages, once they are taken, must be given up, or paid for, or both, as well as prevented or discouraged, if possible, from the start. The only sensible way to do this is to create a public system of punishment. Versions of this view have been elaborated by several different philosophers in the liberal tradition. ${ }^{27}$ It has been attacked on the ground that it relies on a false view of the origin and nature of criminal conduct in our society, and thus fails completely to be of any use in the justification of our system of criminal justice and punishment. What the retributivist has done, on this criticism, is to invent a perfectly sound argument to justify the practice of punishment on principles of justice, except that we cannot appeal to this justification, since our practice of punishment does not take place in a just society. ${ }^{28}$ This is not the place to determine the truth of this criticism, though I confess I am much in sympathy with it. What is important to note is that justifying punishment in this way relies upon a general theory of social justice, rather than upon any narrower principle of retributive justice such as $\\mathrm{R}_{3}$. So, although it can be claimed that this argument does base its justification of punishment upon principles of justice, this is cold comfort for those who want to justify it on nothing more than retributive justice.\n\nAnother kind of attempt to circumvent the dilemma of justification posed earlier is the view that "non-compliance with the law . . . by itself justifies punishment," ${ }^{29}$ or, as Herbert Fingarette ${ }^{30}$ has recently put it (to him we owe the first thorough-going analysis of the idea, "those who disobey requirements must be made to suffer" (513). On this view, anyone who asks, Why should we have the practice of punishing breaches of the law? is in effect told,\n\n[^0] [^0]: ${ }^{27}$ Hart, op. cit., pp. 21-24, 180-183; Herbert Morris, "Persons and Punishment" (1968), reprinted in Feinberg and Gross, eds., op. cit., pp. 572-585; Rawls, op. cit., pp. 235-243. ${ }^{28}$ Jeffrie G.

This is not, however, a central thesis to retributivism as Gendin explains it; for that role he identifies doctrines akin to those I have designated as the principle of responsibility ( $\\mathrm{R}_{4}$ ) and the principle of proportionality ( $\\mathrm{R}_{6}$ ). 30 "Punishment and Suffering," Proceedings of the American Philosophical Association, t., 6 (August 1977): 499-525. Parenthetical page references to Fingarette are to this address.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 18 ~</p>\n\nYou wouldn\'t ask that if you understood the logic of having laws in the first place. It is part of the essence of a law that its violation incurs a punitive response; "in accepting law we necessarily accept retributive punishment" (515). ${ }^{21}$ Against this view, I would offer two objections.\n\nFirst, it is simply false to say that once we have rules we must have a policy of punishing those who violate them. If you won\'t play chess with me by scrupulously adhering to the rules, it hardly follows that I must punish you or threaten to punish you. I can simply refuse to play any further; or I can retaliate by breaking some rules myself; or I can continue to play but under protest. Punishment does not stand to the violation of a rule as being an effect does to having a cause. The difference between laws and other rules does not lie in the fact that laws necessarily involve the punishment of violations. There is no necessity that all or any unlawful conduct be punished. We could content ourselves with prohibiting violations and then visiting upon the violators, if any, accusations of violation, denunciation, blame, remonstrances, other signs of disapproval, and so forth, without ever going on to inflict punishment. We could inform violators of the consequences we predict for them as a result of our disapproval, including their sense of shame and guilt, loss of self-esteem, and the like. Of course, if we care about the harm done when the law is broken, and believe that it can be prevented by suitable prohibitions and threats of punishment, then we will have to be as good as our word when lawbreakers fall into our hands lest our initial prohibitions and threats be taken less seriously than we intended. However, this is not a point the retributivist is entitled to make, because it is an appeal to crime prevention as the justification of threatened punishment.\n\nSecond, Fingarette makes much of the way his conception of retributive punishment is completely "independent of moral justification, even moral justification of law itself" (503; see also 501, 512-514). This has thoroughly novel consequences. Either it excuses the retributivist from the need to justify the practice of punishment, or it requires him to do so by appeal to something other than principles of justice. Few retributivists, I should think, could accept either alternative. Surely, one of the most interesting things about the retributivist\'s theory of punishment, as $\\mathbf{R}_{3}$ (however\n\n[^0] [^0]: ${ }^{21}$ Most of Fingarette\'s argument rests on his conception of "law as power" (505), a notion that I find much less helpful than he does in understanding the role of law in private and public life.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 19 ~</p>\n\ninadequately) suggests, is that the retributivist wants to justify the practice of punishment and tries to do so by appeal to principles of justice. I do not see why this must be a futile effort, nor why shifting our attention to the need to justify a coercive legal order (as Fingarette does) obviates the need to justify the practice of punishment as a legitimate and necessary element of coercion.\n\nSo, as with $\\mathbf{R}_{2}$, I conclude here with $\\mathbf{R}_{3}$ and the problem of providing a general retributive justification for punishment that is both plausible and applicable: It has yet to be done.\n\nV Virtually everything of philosophical interest regarding any theory of punishment can be brought out by considering two questions: How completely does the theory account for our ideas of justice in punishment? How much of a full-scale theory of punishment does this theory yield? I shall not try to recast my discussion of the retributive theory in terms of answers to these questions, but a few concluding comments in this vein are in order.\n\nIf we had conveniently at hand a list of the principles of justice relevant to the theory and practice of punishment, I doubt that many would be retributively based. For example, the idea that justice requires the equal treatment of offenders guilty of the same offense is at best a corollary for the retributivist of his principle of proportionality $\\left(\\mathrm{R}_{2}\\right)$. Retributivism has no direct interest in equal treatment otherwise. If it is thought to be a principle of justice not to punish persons in ways that will do them more harm than good, then retributivism implicitly repudiates this principle outright. If it is thought that offenders have rights that not even the commission of the gravest crime forfeits, retributivism cannot explain this and might deny it. The same holds for considerations that would minimize coercive interventions and restraints in the punishment of offenders; they are of no interest to the retributivist.\n\nAs for the theory of punishment and its systematic practice, retributivism is silent on much that is important. Once lex talionis is set aside, retributivism cannot tell us anything about the appropriateness of different modalities of punishment, e.g., why a system of punishment should be built around incarceration rather than, say, corporal punishments. Many of the familiar features of punishments involve deprivation or suffering, and that they should be proportional to the gravity of the offense, can be explained as well or better by nonretributive theories.\n\nIf I am right, then, retributivism falls short of completeness\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 20 ~</p>\n\nwhen judged by reference to the two main considerations by which any theory of punishment must be judged. Are there, however, some features of the theory of punishment or of the role of justice in punishment that only retributivism can provide, or that it can best explain? Even here I am doubtful; if there are such distinctive contributions to the nature of punishment that retributivism provides, this will have to be shown by means of arguments as yet unformulated.\n\nHUGO ADAM BEDAU Tufts University\n\n# RETRIBUTIVISM AND THE CONCEPT OF PUNISHMENT\\*\n\nBEDAU observes, quite correctly I think, that there are problems with the definition of punishment that must be faced before an assessment of retributivism, viewed as a theory that justifies punishment, can be undertaken. In my paper I endeavor to explore some difficulties with Bedau\'s way of handling these definitional problems, and to suggest that the concept of punishment, itself, may be more retributive in character than many philosophical discussions of punishment acknowledge.\n\nBedau provides two propositions that deal with the nature of punishment. $\\mathrm{A}_{1}$ asserts: "Something imposed on a person counts as a punishment only if it is a harm or deprivation, or causes suffering or pain to that person." $\\mathrm{A}_{2}$ asserts: "A person is liable and eligible for punishment if and only if he is guilty of an offense." I do not think that these provide a clear or correct account of what punishment is. $A_{1}$ cannot be sufficient, because many things may be harms, deprivations, etc. and yet not be punishments. At least three kinds of cases are: confining a person with an infectious disease to a hospital; requiring someone to pay damages for breach of contract; and killing a bank guard in order to rob a bank.\n\nNor can $\\mathrm{A}_{2}$ provide the ground for distinguishing these kinds of cases from cases of punishment. One problem with $\\mathrm{A}_{2}$ is with its use of the idea of an offense. How are we to tell whether or not something is an offense? The most natural account of an offense-\n\n[^0] [^0]: \\* Abstract of a paper to be presented in an apa symposium on the New Retributivism, December 27, 1978, commenting on a paper by Hugo Adam Bedau; see this journal, this issue, 601-620. 0022-362X/78/7511/0620500.50 (C) 1978 The Journal of Philosophy, Inc.\n\n> <p style="text-align: center;">~ page 21 ~</p>\n\n\n< END PAPER >\n\nHere are the bios of the invited participants:\n\n< START BIOS >\n\nName: Prof. Miriam K.

Youâve defended a neoâKantian reconstruction that frames R3 as a requirement of moral accounting and respect for agency. Could you spell out that justificatory structure: what is it, exactly, about responsible past wrongdoing that makes intentional hard treatment not only permissible but required, without smuggling in preventive goods? And why, on your view, may the guilty be intentionally harmed while the innocent may not?\n\nOn the nature of punishment, Bedau adds A1 and A2. Do you regard hard treatment (harm/suffering) as a constitutive element (A1), or can reparative sanctions without suffering still count as punishment within a retributive framework? Where, if anywhere, do you place communicative/restorative elementsâside constraints, substitutes, or integral to retributive punishment?\n\nTurning to proportionality, Bedau argues that once we abandon literal lex talionis, R2 becomes indeterminate or arbitrary. You propose a âmoral equivalence metricâ that integrates culpability and harm while forbidding instrumentalization. How does your metric avoid the Card and von Hirsch pitfalls he diagnoses (measurement opacity; collapsing seriousness into harm; arbitrary penalty schedules)? Could you walk us through a concrete caseâsay, provoked killing versus felony murder, or sexual assault with different autonomy lossesâshowing how culpability and harm are weighted and how the upper and lower bounds are set?\n\nFinally, on capital punishment: youâve argued narrow eligibility where culpability is maximal with nearâperfect procedures. Given Bedauâs epistemic skepticism and arbitrariness concerns, does your deontic reconstruction leave any real space for the death penalty in practice, or does it collapse into abolition under current conditions? What empirical or procedural thresholds would be necessary to clear your deontic hurdles?\n\n---\n\n### Speaker: Prof. Miriam K. Strauss\n\nThank you. Let me take the questions in sequence.\n\n1) Reconstructing R3 as moral accounting, not moral alchemy\n\nHartâs label âmoral alchemyâ makes R3 sound like a crude hedonic balancing: add suffering to wrongdoing and somehow we get moral gold. That caricatures the deontic structure. On my view, culpable wrongdoing is not just a bad state of the world; it is a normative act. In willing an assault or a fraud, the offender sets his agency against anotherâs standing as an equal. That past act generates directed secondâpersonal claims: the victim has a claim to be answered; the polity, as the public agent of equal freedom, has a claim to demand that answer; and the offender has a correlative duty to account for what he has done.\n\nPunishment is the institutional form of that moral accounting. It has three elements:\n- Authoritative censure that addresses the agent as the responsible author of the wrong.\n- A nonâoptional burden linked to the wrong, through which the agent bears the cost of his choice rather than externalizing it onto the victim and community.\n- A status adjustment that restores the normative equilibrium: it marks that the wrong has been taken up and answered, and that the offender reenters the order of mutual accountability.\n\nThis does not smuggle in preventive goods. Even if no one else learns of the punishment, and even if the offender is undeterrable, we still owe the accounting to the victim and to the idea of equal agency. Conversely, because the point is answerability, it explains why only the guilty may be intentionally harmed: culpable wrongdoing changes oneâs normative position. By oneâs own past will, one has incurred liability to hard treatment as part of answering for that will. The innocent have incurred no such liability. To harm them intentionally for any further good would be to instrumentalize them. So R3, properly reconstructed, is not âsuffering-for-its-own-sakeâ; it is a deontic requirement to settle a moral debt in a way that respects the offender as a responsible chooser.\n\n2) A1 and A2; the place of repair and communication\n\nI accept A2 outright: guilt is the gatekeeper for penal eligibility. On A1, I take âhard treatmentâ to be constitutive in the following modest sense: punishment must impose a nonâoptional burdensome demand that communicates censure. But the burden need not be optimized for suffering. Reparative sanctions can count as punishment when and because they are imposed as authoritative, nonâoptional duties of repair that carry the institutionâs censure. A wellâdesigned restitution order, compulsory participation in a victimâoffender conference, or a constraint that funds trauma care can be punitive if it is imposed as part of the moral accounting, not merely as a civil remedy or a voluntary good deed.\n\nCommunicative and restorative elements are not optional adornments; they are integral to retributive punishmentâs point. Without communication and opportunities for reâacceptance of the norm, hard treatment risks becoming mere pain delivery. At the same time, for grave wrongs, repair alone will rarely discharge the whole debt; some hard-treatment component remains required to register the gravity of the past choice. The structure is âcensure plus accountable burden,â with repair able to discharge part of the burden when genuine and appropriately linked to the wrong.\n\n3) Proportionality without talion: the moral equivalence metric\n\nI agree with Bedau that literal talion is untenable, and I share his worry about arbitrariness once talion is gone. My âmoral equivalence metricâ tries to avoid both Cardâs measurement opacity and von Hirschâs collapse into harm by:\n\n- Two independent cores:\n  1) Culpability: reasonâresponsiveness at the time of action (purpose, knowledge, recklessness, negligence), quality of reasons (malice, predation), partial excuses (provocation, duress), and impairments that undermine answerability. No strict liability: felony outcomes are graded by risk taken and foreseeability, not by doctrinal imputation.\n  2) Harm and risk: not merely physical injury but rights-based losses, including autonomy deprivation, duration, multiplicity, creation of a credible-risk environment, and long-term capability losses. Here I take seriously feminist insights about lived, intersectional impacts in sexual and domestic violence.\n\n- Aggravating relational wrongs: abuse of trust or public office, exploitation of vulnerability.\n\n- Dignity constraints: penalties must not degrade or instrumentalize; they must be consistent with treating the person as an end. This rules out sexualized, mutilative, or terrorizing punishments regardless of âfit.â\n\n- Ranges with uncertainty: we map seriousness to sentencing bands, not points, and we publish the weights and their confidence intervals. Following Prof. Chenâs work, the scale is empirical and revisable: we validate components against community judgments, victim-impact research, and comparative case review, and we flag cases where uncertainty is high so that appellate oversight and reason-giving are mandatory. Judge Villanuevaâs structured discretion is then the institutional guardrail.\n\nTwo concrete applications\n\na) Provoked killing vs felony murder\n\n- Provoked killing (adequate provocation; intentional but in heat of passion; no prior cruelty; immediate aftermath confession and assistance):\n  Culpability: baseline âpurpose to killâ is the highest level. Significant provocation is a partial excuse because it impairs self-control without negating reasons-responsiveness. I would reduce two levels (from 5 to 3 on a 0â5 culpability scale).\n  Harm: death is maximal (5), with adjustments for multiplicity or torture not present here.\n  Relational aggravation: none.\n  Result: Seriousness places the case in a high but not maximal band. As a concrete guide, a jurisdiction might set a presumptive range of 8â12 yearsâ incarceration plus mandatory censure and reparative obligations (support to dependents of the deceased, memorial fund), with reasoned departures allowed only on written justification.\n\n- Felony murder (armed robbery with a loaded weapon; death of a bystander during a foreseeable confrontation; no purpose to kill; substantial prior planning for the felony):\n  Culpability: no intention to kill; but extreme recklessness regarding lethal risk in the service of predatory ends merits a culpability of 3â4 depending on the evidence of foresight. I reject strict liability imputation: the grade rises with the degree of risk embraced, not just the felony label.\n  Harm: death (5).\n  Relational aggravation: predation using weapons in public space adds modest aggravation.\n  Result: Often this will sit in a band above the provoked killing when the risk-taking is extreme and chosen for predation (e.g., 12â20 years). Where the lethal outcome was a freak accident against moderate risk, it should fall below (e.g., 7â12 years). The key is transparent grading of risk and foresight.\n\nb) Sexual assault with different autonomy losses\n\n- Stranger rape with weapon, confinement, and threats of further harm:\n  Culpability: purpose to sexually violate; planning; explicit terrorization (5).\n  Harm: profound autonomy deprivation, enduring trauma and credible-risk environment (4â5), plus confinement and weapon use as aggravators.\n  Result: Maximal non-homicide band (e.g., 12â18 years), plus long-term supervision and non-contact orders, alongside reparative obligations. No sexualized penalties; dignity constraints bind.\n\n- Acquaintance assault involving grooming, exploitation of intoxication, and repeated incidents:\n  Culpability: purpose to violate; exploitation of vulnerability and trust (5), with relational aggravation for grooming and repetition.\n  Harm: possibly fewer physical injuries on a given occasion, but greater long-term autonomy loss from repetition and social entanglement; the metric must capture that (3â4 with upward adjustments for repetition).\n  Result: Comparable or higher band than the stranger case if the pattern shows domination over time. Reparative duties are mandatory but cannot displace the custodial core; within-band mitigation is possible where the offender undertakes genuine, victimârespecting repair and acknowledges wrongdoing.\n\nThese illustrations show three features I think Bedau rightly demands: culpability is assessed independently of harm; âseriousnessâ is not a black box; and mapping to penalties is by transparent bands with reason-giving, subject to appellate review and periodic recalibration.\n\n4) Capital punishment under a deontic reconstruction\n\nConceptually, the metric leaves narrow space for capital punishment: only where culpability is maximal (purposeful, repeated, or mass killings; terrorism; genocide), no substantial mitigation, and where the communityâs most severe hard treatment is necessary to complete the moral accounting without violating dignity. But two further constraints matter:\n\n- Epistemic threshold: the system must achieve a demonstrably vanishingly low risk of wrongful conviction in capitalâeligible cases. At minimum: recorded interrogations; openâfile discovery; exclusion of uncorroborated jailhouse informants; validated forensics; robust defense funding; racially blind charging screens; multiple independent lines of inculpatory evidence (DNA or equivalent); and an institutionalized âresidual doubtâ safety valve. I would want credible, prospective audits showing an error rate well below one per thousand, with narrow confidence intervals across subpopulations.\n\n- Nonâarbitrariness: capital charging and sentencing must be uniform statewide (or nationally), with centralized charging authority, guideline constraints, written reasons, and automatic, expedited review; documented elimination of race, county, and wealth effects; and execution protocols that avoid both degradation and long delays that themselves become cruel.\n\nOn present evidence, these conditions are not met. Error rates are nonâtrivial; disparities are persistent; and the combination of delay and death row conditions undermines dignity constraints. So although my deontic account does not rule out the death penalty in principle, in practice it points toward abolition under current conditions. The maximal hard treatment consistent with agencyârespect will be lifelong incapacitation under humane conditions, coupled with an architecture of censure and structured opportunities for acknowledgment and partial repair.\n\nA final note of challenge\n\nLeifâs purely preventive frame cannot explain the asymmetry between guilty and innocent: if harm reduction is the only currency, scapegoating in rare highâstakes cases is, in principle, eligible. Fingaretteâs conceptual internalism, by contrast, risks erasing the difference between authoritative norms and just punishment of breaches. A legal order may conceptually call for censure; it does not thereby morally license the whole menu of hard treatments. The deontic accounting view secures both: it explains why punishment is owed to the past act and why its forms are constrained by dignity. And it gives us a disciplined way, through a transparent metric and institutional guardrails, to avoid the indeterminacy that rightly troubles Bedau.\n\n---\n\n### Speaker: Host\n\nDr. Holm, Prof. Strauss argues that a purely preventive account cannot explain the asymmetry between guilty and innocentâif harm reduction is the only currency, scapegoating sometimes looks eligible in principle. From within a nonretributive framework, what grounds the categorical bar on intentionally harming the innocent and the corresponding permission to impose hard treatment only on those who are guilty (R1/A2), without quietly importing desert? Is it ruleâconsequentialist legitimacy, epistemic error costs, or something else? Please be explicit about the normative structure.\n\nOn proportionality (R2), Bedau worries that once talion is abandoned, harmâbased scales either collapse into arbitrariness (von Hirsch) or measurement opacity (Card). You favor a pragmatic R2 anchored to social harm and risk, not desert. What would a determinate, preventive proportionality look like? Could you work through the same two contrasts Strauss discussedâ(a) provoked killing vs. felony murder; (b) two rape scenariosâand show how a harmâreduction metric would set ranges, emphasizing incapacitation, risk to reoffend, and marginal deterrence? Where would your recommendations diverge from her moralâequivalence bands, and why?\n\nMethodologically, do you accept Prof. Chenâs multidimensional seriousness indices and uncertainty intervals as a decision aid for a preventive regime? If so, which dimensions map to preventive goals (e.g., victim capability losses as predictors of social harm; culpability as a proxy for future risk)? If not, what is the alternative measurement strategy that avoids Bedauâs arbitrariness charge?\n\nFinally, on capital punishment: given current evidence on certainty, swiftness, and severity, do you see any credible marginal deterrent or incapacitative case that survives errorâcosts and legitimacy losses? If not, say so plainly. And take a stand on Straussâs closing challenge: can a purely preventive theory vindicate the guilty/innocent asymmetry without help from R3âs moral accounting?\n\n---\n\n### Speaker: Dr. Leif Anders Holm\n\nThank you. Let me be as clear as I can about the nonretributive architecture Iâm working with.\n\n1) Guilty/innocent asymmetry without R3\n\nMy framework has two layers:\n\n- Telos: reduce future victimization (expected social harm).\n- Legitimacy sideâconstraints that are not âdesertâ claims but conditions for the preventive project to be effective and permissible in a liberal order.\n\nThose constraints are justified on ruleâconsequentialist and publicâreason grounds, not on moral accounting for past wrongs.\n\n- No intentional harm to innocents. As a standing rule this is a dominance strategy for harm reduction. Once the public believes the state will sometimes sacrifice innocents âfor the greater good,â you get cascading losses: less reporting and cooperation with police, lower compliance with the law, jury nullification, and decreased perceived fairness. The empirical literature on procedural justice and legal compliance is straightforward: legitimacy begets cooperation and selfâregulation. Even if you could concoct a ârare scapegoatâ case where net harms fall locally, adopting such a practice as a rule destroys the informational and cooperative ecosystem that crime control depends on. Add the epistemic problem: because we canât identify those ârareâ cases reliably ex ante, a carveâout becomes a mechanism for error and abuse. So the rule âdo not intentionally punish the innocentâ is not smuggled desert; itâs a systemâlevel constraint without which prevention fails in equilibrium.\n\n- Why hard treatment may be imposed on the guilty. Not because they âoweâ it, but because: (a) they are the locus where incapacitation and specific deterrence have nontrivial expected effects; (b) linking sanctions to actual wrongdoing is required to keep the deterrence signal informative. If sanctions decouple from culpable conduct, the signalâtoânoise ratio collapses and general deterrence erodes. A2 (eligibility upon guilt) is thus a fairness constraint instrumental to credible, cooperative crime control. Proof standards, due process, and errorâminimizing procedures are part of that same legitimacy bundle.\n\nCall this preventive legitimacy: a package of nonâdesert constraints necessary for the state to reduce harm without provoking larger harms through mistrust, error, and abuse.\n\n2) Preventive proportionality (R2) without talion\n\nâProportionality,â for me, is not a metaphysical fit; itâs the requirement that the incremental severity and modality of a sanction be justified by marginal prevention benefits net of costs. A determinate preventive R2 evaluates:\n\n- Incapacitation benefit: expected averted harm from not being at liberty during the sanction.\n- Specific deterrence/rehabilitation: expected reduction in that offenderâs postâsanction risk from programming, supervision, and credible consequences.\n- General deterrence: elasticity of the offense to certainty, swiftness, and severity; we exploit the dimensions that actually move behavior (certainty and celerity generally dominate severity).\n- Collateral costs: criminogenic effects of imprisonment, family disruption, laborâmarket scarring, fiscal costs, legitimacy penalties, and error costs.\n\nWe then set ranges that maximize expected net prevention under constraints of equal treatment and basic rights.\n\nTwo contrasts, worked through:\n\na) Provoked killing vs felony murder\n\n- Provoked killing (adequate provocation; no prior violence; immediate surrender; remorse):\n  Risk profile: typically low baseârate for future lethal violence; eventâdriven. Validated tools (e.g., OxRec; HCRâ20) usually flag such cases as lower risk once acute precipitants are removed.\n  Prevention calculus: long incapacitation yields diminishing returns and higher criminogenic costs. General deterrent payoff of severity is weak in heatâofâpassion contexts; certainty (clear charging and swift adjudication) matters more than additional years.\n  Range: 4â8 yearsâ custody with frontâloaded, evidenceâbased programming (emotion/selfâcontrol, substance abuse if relevant), followed by 8â10 years of intensive supervision, firearms prohibitions, and victimâsafety conditions. Structured restorative options may safely substitute for custody at the low end when validated risk is very low and victims consent. This will be below Prof. Straussâs bands because my target is future risk, not moral equivalence.\n\n- Felony murder (armed robbery with loaded weapon; death of bystander; substantial planning; no purpose to kill):\n  Risk profile: lifestyle criminality; willingness to take extreme risks for predatory gain; higher forward risk of violent reoffending absent change.\n  Prevention calculus: incapacitation yields more averted harm here; general deterrence is also more responsive: clear weapon/lethalârisk enhancements reliably shift behavior at the margin (e.g., fewer guns carried during robberies).\n  Range: 10â16 yearsâ custody, with strong weaponâuse enhancements tied to actual risk imposition (brandishing a loaded firearm in public robberies, not merely felony labels), plus longâterm supervision. Where the lethal outcome was genuinely freakish given modest risk (e.g., unarmed coâfelon in a lowârisk burglary), the range drops (6â10 years). I agree with Strauss in rejecting strict liability; itâs the risk embraced, not the label, that matters. I tend to place highârisk felony murders above provoked killings because the forwardâlooking risk and marginal deterrence effects are greater.\n\nb) Two rape scenarios\n\n- Stranger rape with weapon and confinement:\n  Harm is grave; but for prevention, the key is risk type. Predatory stranger rapists with planning and coercive control cues are the small group with markedly higher sexual and violent recidivism. For them:\n  Range: 12â18 yearsâ custody with specialized treatment, followed by 10+ years of intensive supervision, exclusion zones, noâcontact orders, and tailored controls. The sanction is not ratcheted for âexpressive fitâ but for incapacitation and targeted general deterrence (weapon use enhancements). We also fund certainty: investments in forensic capability and victimâsupport to raise reporting and clearance.\n\n- Acquaintance assaults involving grooming and repetition:\n  These patterns predict continued offending within networks, even if perâincident physical injury is lower. The prevention lever is longâhorizon control of access and opportunity, plus behavior change.\n  Range: similar or higher than the stranger case if dynamic risk is high (patterned predation): 10â16 yearsâ custody plus lengthy supervision and strict contact and digitalâcommunication controls; mandated treatment. Where validated risk is moderate and victims approve, part of the custodial term can be replaced with intensive, enforceable communityâbased regimes that actually reduce reoffending (swiftâcertainâfair supervision; alcohol/drug controls where relevant). Severity beyond these bands buys little prevention; raising certainty and celerity buys more.\n\nDividing line with Prof. Strauss: I will not pay âmoral debtâ with extra years when the expected prevention yield is flat. I will, however, maintain a severity floor for highâharm crimes to preserve the credibility of the norm (legitimacy), but the heavy lifting comes from certainty, swiftness, supervision, and tailored controls.\n\n3) Measurement: from âseriousnessâ to prevention impact\n\nIâm broadly supportive of Prof. Chenâs multidimensional indices as part of the front end, provided we add risk and cost. For a preventive regime, the relevant dimensions and their roles are:\n\n- Harm severity and capability loss: not to justify pain, but to weight averted harm in the objective function and to prioritize investments in certainty (we are willing to spend more to prevent highâharm offenses).\n- Culpability elements (purpose, planning) as weak proxies for stable propensities and hence forward risk (careful to debias for socioâeconomic confounds).\n- Risk/needs factors (static and dynamic): strongest predictors of incapacitation benefit and responsivity to interventions.\n- Uncertainty intervals: when the scale says âunderâdeterminate,â we default to narrower bands, require written reasons, and prefer reversible sanctions (communityâbased controls) to minimize error costs.\n\nI would operationalize this as a Prevention Impact Score for each sanction option:\nPIS = expected averted harm (incapacitation + general deterrence + specific deterrence) â expected costs (fiscal + criminogenic + legitimacy + error),\nestimated with Bayesian models and updated via audits and policy trials. We publish the weights and the audits. That is how we answer Bedauâs arbitrariness charge: by making the tradeoffs explicit, empirically estimated, and revisable.\n\n4) Capital punishment\n\nOn present evidence, there is no credible marginal deterrent effect of executions over long prison terms once you control for certainty and swiftness; any small deterrence claims are swamped by error costs and legitimacy losses (including racially patterned disparities) that themselves impede crime control. Incapacitation adds nothing relative to LWOP. There is suggestive evidence of brutalization effects in some jurisdictions. The fiscal cost is higher. So the preventive case fails. My view is unambiguous: abolish.\n\n5) Reply to Prof. Straussâs challenge\n\nA purely preventive theory can vindicate the asymmetry without desert by committing, ex ante and publicly, to legitimacyâpreserving rulesâchief among them the categorical ban on intentionally harming the innocent and the correlating of hard treatment with proved wrongdoing. Those commitments are not windowâdressing; they are part of what makes prevention work in a free society. The ârare scapegoatâ hypothetical ignores equilibrium effects and the knowledge problem. If you force me into a catastrophe trolley case where every equilibrium consideration is bracketed, of course my framework looks less satisfyingâthatâs because it is designed for actual institutional practice, not for thought experiments.\n\nTwo gentle challenges in return:\n\n- Deontic âmoral accountingâ still has to pick numbers. Once you leave talion behind, your bands are ultimately anchored in socially negotiated weights and legitimacy, too. If we both must be transparent about those weights, we should prefer the regime that demonstrably reduces victimization per unit of coercion.\n\n- On capital punishment, your procedural thresholds are so demanding that, in practice, your view converges with mine. If that is right, then we should design our institutions for the world we have: close capital pathways, invest in certainty and swiftness, and reserve the severest deprivations for those subpopulations where risk and marginal deterrence make them preventive rather than symbolic.\n\n---\n\n### Speaker: Host\n\nBoth Prof. Strauss and Dr. Holm lean on measurement to avoid Bedauâs charge of arbitrariness in R2, but in different ways. Youâve argued for multidimensional seriousness indices with uncertainty intervals. Iâd like you to be concrete and rigorous here.\n\n1) Model design. Specify a workable seriousness construct S with distinct components for (a) culpability (purpose/knowledge/recklessness/negligence; partial excuses; relational aggravators), (b) harm and risked harm (including autonomy loss, duration, multiplicity, credible-risk environments), and (c) abuse of trust or public office. How would you estimate weights (e.g., IRT/Bayesian hierarchical modeling)? What normative guardrails keep S from collapsing into mere harm (SellinâWolfgangâs problem) or into opaque judgment (Cardâs Full Measure)?\n\n2) Uncertainty and bands. Show how to produce 95% intervals around S and then map S to sentencing bands rather than points. What trigger rules would you recommend when intervals straddle band thresholds (e.g., default to the lower band; require written reasons; appellate review)?\n\n3) Worked examples (numbers welcome). Using stylized but realistic inputs, compute S (with intervals) for the two pairs discussed:\n   a) Provoked killing (adequate provocation; immediate surrender; no prior violence) vs. felony murder (loaded weapon in a planned robbery; bystander killed; clear foresight of lethal risk). \n   b) Sexual assault cases: (i) stranger rape with weapon, confinement, threats; (ii) acquaintance assault involving grooming, intoxication exploitation, repeated incidents. \nMake explicit how culpability and autonomy-loss components differ and how that affects S and bands.\n\n4) Validation and democracy. Outline a validation pipeline: community surveys (including survivor samples), victim-impact research, recidivism forecasts, and crossâjurisdictional calibration. How often should weights be reâestimated? How do you prevent the scale from encoding racial/class bias (e.g., by excluding socioâeconomic proxies and auditing disparate impact)?\n\n5) Integration with preventive aims. Dr. Holm wants a Prevention Impact Score; Prof. Strauss seeks a moralâequivalence ceiling. Can your S serve bothâe.g., as a desertâanchored upper bound and as an input to prevention calculus? If so, state the interface: S caps severity; risk/needs govern the point within the band. If not, say why.\n\nFinally, address Bedauâs worry directly: why isnât your banding still ultimately arbitrary? What features of transparency, empirical estimation, and periodic democratic revision make it the least arbitrary feasible scheme under nonâideal conditions?\n\n---\n\n### Speaker: Prof. Wei-Lun Chen\n\nThanks, Chair. Let me put my cards on the table: R1 is nonnegotiable; R2 is indispensable but underdeterminate; R3 doesnât carry justificatory water. My project is to turn the âfitâ problem into a measured constraint with error bars that institutions can use responsibly.\n\n1) Model design: a workable seriousness construct S\n\nStructure. S is a latent construct composed of three separable pillars, each itself multidimensional:\n\n- Culpability C (what the agent was responsible for choosing)\n  - Mental state: purpose, knowledge, extreme recklessness, recklessness, negligence (ordered categories).\n  - Quality of reasons: predation, cruelty, opportunism vs. panic, mixed motives.\n  - Partial excuses: provocation (adequate), duress (non-exculpatory), severe but non-exculpatory impairment.\n  - Reasons-responsiveness: planning, preparation; availability of lawful alternatives.\n  - Exclusions: no strict liability; prior record is not part of C (thatâs risk, not instant culpability).\n\n- Harm and risked harm H,R (what was imposed on or credibly risked to others)\n  - Realized harm H: death; serious injury; sexual/autonomy invasion; confinement; psychological trauma; duration; multiplicity; capability losses (work, family, mobility).\n  - Risked harm R: ex ante lethal/serious-injury risk embraced (weapon brandishing, discharge); creation of credible-risk environments; endangerment to multiple persons; public-space risk externalities.\n  - Feminist/ victimological content: autonomy-loss is not a proxy for medical injury; it includes terrorization, grooming, and long-term constraints on life plans.\n\n- Relational aggravation T (abuse of normative position)\n  - Abuse of trust or public office; fiduciary/caretaker roles; exploitation of dependency or vulnerability (functionally defined).\n\nEstimation. We estimate S with a Bayesian hierarchical IRT framework:\n\n- Items. Each of the above subcomponents is operationalized as polytomous items (graded-response models). Example: âmental stateâ is an ordered item; âprovocationâ is a partially crediting item that reduces C.\n- Latent dimensions. We fit a multi-dimensional IRT where C, H, R, and T are separate latent traits. S is then a weighted linear composite of the four latent scores, re-scaled to a 0â100 index.\n- Weights. We place weakly informative priors on the weights Î± = (Î±C, Î±H, Î±R, Î±T), with normative guardrails:\n  - Î±C â [0.35, 0.60] (culpability must matter at least as much as harm alone).\n  - Î±H â [0.30, 0.50].\n  - Î±R â [0.05, 0.25] (risked harm has independent, nontrivial weight).\n  - Î±T â [0.05, 0.15].\n  - Î±C + Î±H + Î±R + Î±T = 1.\n- Identification/anchors. We anchor the scale with a small set of paradigmatic offenses (e.g., aggravated stranger rape, armed robbery causing no injury, intentional homicide without torture) to fix the metric. We also enforce monotonicity constraints (worse item responses cannot lower the latent trait).\n\nData sources. To calibrate item difficulties/discriminations and weights:\n- Deliberative community panels (probability samples plus survivor oversamples) doing pairwise/bestâworst seriousness rankings on standardized vignettes.\n- Victim-impact research (standardized instruments for autonomy/capability loss).\n- Comparative sentencing panels (judges/prosecutors/defenders) to check face validity and to stress-test invariance.\n\nGuardrails against the classic failures:\n- Against SellinâWolfgangâs collapse into harm: culpability is its own latent dimension with a minimum weight floor; we measure risked harm separately from realized harm; and we forbid proxies for outcomes (e.g., medical bills) that smuggle socioeconomic status into H.\n- Against Cardâs opacity: item content, thresholds, discrimination parameters, and Î±-weights are published; code is open-source; and sensitivity analyses show how S moves if you vary Î± within the permitted priors.\n\n2) Uncertainty and bands\n\nUncertainty. For each case, the model yields a posterior for each latent (C, H, R, T) and hence for S. We report the posterior mean SÌ and a 95% credible interval [S5, S95].\n\nBanding. We partition S into seriousness bands with published cutpoints tied to anchor offenses. Illustratively:\n- Band 7: 85â100 (maximal non-capital)\n- Band 6: 75â85\n- Band 5: 65â75\n- Band 4: 55â65\n- Band 3: 45â55\n- Band 2: 35â45\n- Band 1: <35\n\nTrigger rules when intervals straddle thresholds:\n- Lenity default: if [S5, S95] spans two bands, start in the lower band.\n- Reasoned elevation: an upward move into the higher band requires written reasons that identify specific, model-recognized factors or documented miscodings; automatic appellate review.\n- Indeterminacy flag: if [S5, S95] spans more than two bands, treat as underdeterminateâconvene a panel, prefer reversible sanctions, and narrow the decision with additional fact-finding if possible.\n\n3) Worked examples (stylized numbers)\n\nFor concreteness, set Î±C=0.45, Î±H=0.35, Î±R=0.12, Î±T=0.08 (within guardrails). Component scores are on 0â10 scales; S rescaled to 0â100.\n\na) Provoked killing vs felony murder\n\n- Provoked killing\n  - C: purposeful killing (10) minus adequate provocation (â2) minus immediate surrender/remorse (â0.2 to â0.5): C â 7.8 Â± 0.6.\n  - H: death: H â 9.6 Â± 0.3.\n  - R: low ex ante risk creation beyond the act itself: R â 2.0 Â± 0.7.\n  - T: none: T = 0.\n  - SÌ = 0.45*7.8 + 0.35*9.6 + 0.12*2.0 + 0.08*0 = 7.11 â 71.1 (Â± 3.0 SE â 95% â [65.2, 77.0]).\n  - Band: 5 by lenity (interval straddles 5/6).\n\n- Felony murder (planned armed robbery; loaded weapon; clear foresight of lethal risk; bystander killed)\n  - C: extreme recklessness re: life, predatory plan: C â 6.8 Â± 0.7 (no intent to kill).\n  - H: death: H â 9.6 Â± 0.3.\n  - R: high ex ante lethal risk embraced (public gunpoint robbery with loaded firearm): R â 8.5 Â± 0.6.\n  - T: none: T = 0.\n  - SÌ = 0.45*6.8 + 0.35*9.6 + 0.12*8.5 = 7.44 â 74.4 (Â± 3.4 SE â 95% â [67.8, 81.0]).\n  - Band: 5 by lenity (interval straddles 5/6), with transparent reason to sit toward the top of Band 5 or to depart upward with reasons: the R component is doing work that a pure harm scale misses.\n\nObservation. The ex ante risk embraced pushes felony murder above provoked killing even though both have H=death, because we refuse to collapse seriousness into realized harm.\n\nb) Sexual assault: stranger armed rape vs acquaintance grooming/repetition\n\n- Stranger rape with weapon, confinement, threats\n  - C: purposeful sexual violation with planning: C â 8.5 Â± 0.6.\n  - H: autonomy deprivation severe; confinement; credible ongoing risk; trauma: H â 8.8 Â± 0.6.\n  - R: high ex ante risk (weapon, threats): R â 7.5 Â± 0.6.\n  - T: none: T = 0.\n  - SÌ = 0.45*8.5 + 0.35*8.8 + 0.12*7.5 = 7.81 â 78.1 (Â± 3.5 SE â 95% â [71.2, 84.9]).\n  - Band: 6 (interval may just nick Band 5; reasons can resolve).\n\n- Acquaintance assault with grooming, intoxication exploitation, repeated incidents\n  - C: purposeful violation; grooming; repetition: C â 8.5 Â± 0.6.\n  - H: per-incident physical injury lower but autonomy loss amplified by repetition and social entanglement; enduring capability loss: H â 8.2 Â± 0.6 (with repetition modifier).\n  - R: moderate ex ante risk to physical integrity; high risk of continuing victimization within network: R â 6.0 Â± 0.7.\n  - T: abuse of trust/vulnerability: T â 2.0 Â± 0.5 (on a 0â3 scale).\n  - SÌ = 0.45*8.5 + 0.35*8.2 + 0.12*6.0 + 0.08*2.0 = 7.58 â 75.8 (Â± 3.6 SE â 95% â [68.8, 82.7]).\n  - Band: 6 or high 5; repeated domination and relational abuse can place this as serious as, or more serious than, a one-off stranger caseâcapturing Prof. OâRourkeâs concern.\n\nMapping bands to dispositional ranges (illustrative, not prescriptive):\n- Band 7: 15â25 years (max non-capital)\n- Band 6: 10â15 years\n- Band 5: 7â12 years\n- Band 4: 3â8 years\nRanges are ceilings for retributive proportionality; within-band placement is governed by prevention (see 5).\n\n4) Validation and democracy\n\nPipeline.\n- Elicitation. Biennial community seriousness surveys with stratified random sampling; oversample survivors and marginalized communities; tasks: paired comparisons, bestâworst scaling, and vignette rating.\n- Victim-impact science. Longitudinal studies of autonomy and capability losses after different crimes; integrate as H indicators.\n- Judicial calibration. Periodic structured elicitation from judges and practitioners to identify divergences between S and reflective practice.\n- Cross-jurisdictional calibration. Multi-state pooling with hierarchical priors; allow local random effects while keeping national anchors.\n\nRe-estimation cadence.\n- Annual incremental updates (Bayesian updating on new data).\n- 5-year major re-estimation and public hearing cycle; sunset clause on weights unless reauthorized.\n\nBias prevention.\n- Exclude protected-class proxies from S (race, neighborhood, income, immigration status). S is about the instant offense, not the personâs social location.\n- Define âvulnerabilityâ functionally (custodial dependence, disability) and apply symmetrically to avoid valuing some victimsâ harms less.\n- Differential item functioning (DIF) tests across groups; drop or adjust items that behave differently without principled reason.\n- Disparate impact audits: simulate sentencing under S; publish group-level effects; require justification and revision if disparities appear that cannot be normatively defended.\n\nGovernance.\n- Independent Sentencing Metrics Commission with members drawn from survivors, formerly incarcerated persons, line defenders/prosecutors, judges, statisticians, and ethicists.\n- Open data and code; redaction protocols to protect privacy.\n- Notice-and-comment for any change to Î±-guardrails or band cutpoints; legislative ratification for major shifts.\n\n5) Integration with preventive aims (Strauss ceiling; Holm PIS)\n\nYesâS can serve both.\n\n- Step 1 (Desert cap/floor). Compute S and its band with intervals. That band is the permissible severity window as a matter of proportionality (upper bound; you may also set a desert floor for norm-signaling).\n- Step 2 (Prevention choice). For options within the band, compute Dr. Holmâs Prevention Impact Score:\n  PIS(option) = E[averted harm via incapacitation + general deterrence + specific deterrence] â E[costs: criminogenic, fiscal, legitimacy, error].\n  Choose the option maximizing PIS subject to dignity constraints (no degrading penalties) and the S ceiling.\n- Step 3 (Reason-giving and review). Document which factors drove S and PIS; require appellate review for out-of-band moves or when uncertainty flags fire.\n\nThis interface preserves Prof. Straussâs side-constraint role for desert, while enabling Dr. Holmâs forward-looking optimization inside the constraint set.\n\nWhy this isnât âstill arbitraryâ (answering Bedau)\n\nThree reasons.\n\n- Structural transparency and constraint. We do not hide value choices: Î±-weights, item content, cutpoints, and code are public; Î± has guardrails that entrench the independent role of culpability and risked harm. Dignity constraints forbid certain penalty types regardless of S.\n\n- Quantified uncertainty and lenity. We never pretend to precision we donât have. Intervals are reported; when underdetermination is material, we default to the lower band, require reasons to go higher, prefer reversible sanctions, and flag cases for appellate scrutiny.\n\n- Democratic revisability with audit. The scale is not a technocratâs oracle; it is a measured instantiation of community judgments and victim research, subject to regular re-elicitation, bias audits, and legislative oversight. That institutionalizes contestation, which is the only honest cure for indeterminacy in a diverse polity.\n\nTwo friendly challenges back to colleagues:\n\n- Miriam, once you publish your âmoral equivalenceâ weights and bands, you will face the same underdetermination. My proposal is simply to own it statistically and govern it institutionally.\n\n- Leif, if prevention alone sets severity, the temptation will always be to sneak priors about desert into âlegitimacy costs.â Using S explicitly as a ceiling/floor keeps that accounting candid and democratically supervised.\n\nBottom line. We cannot abolish judgment from proportionality; we can domesticate it. A multidimensional, audited, and revisable S with uncertainty bands gives us the least-arbitrary feasible map from wrongs to permissible punishment under non-ideal conditions. It avoids SellinâWolfgangâs harm collapse, Cardâs opacity, and von Hirschâs point estimatesâand it gives Judge Villanueva exactly what she asked for: structured discretion with reasons and review.\n\n---\n\n### Speaker: Host\n\nJudge Villanueva, youâve asked for structured discretion with reasons and review. Youâve now heard Prof. Chen propose a multidimensional seriousness index S with uncertainty bands and lenity triggers, and Dr. Holm propose a Prevention Impact Score (PIS) to choose within-band sanctions. From a guideline designerâs perspective, please get concrete about institutionalization:\n\n1) Guideline architecture. How would you translate S-bands into a workable grid? Specify: (a) default ranges per band; (b) departure rules when the 95% interval straddles thresholds; (c) the standard of proof and trier for S-affecting facts (e.g., autonomy-loss magnitude, risked harm)âjury beyond a reasonable doubt, or judge by clear and convincing? \n\n2) Reason-giving and review. Draft the core elements you would require in a sentencing statement that uses S and PIS (e.g., identify the items driving C, H, R, T; disclose the credible interval; explain any upward move despite lenity; articulate the PIS tradeoff). What should be the appellate standard of review for (i) S computation; (ii) band selection; (iii) within-band choice?\n\n3) Integrating reparative options. Prof. Strauss treats reparative duties as potentially punitive when imposed as censure-backed, non-optional burdens; Prof. Qureshi would go further and see repair as presumptive. Within your mixed theory, where and how would you authorize validated restorative dispositions within a band without violating equal-treatment expectations? What screening (victim consent? risk tools?) and what backstops (swift consequences for noncompliance) would you build in?\n\n4) Managing bias and background injustice. Dr. Baptiste will press the Murphy critique: any proportionality scheme risks laundering structural inequality. What concrete auditing and remedial tools would you write into the guidelines to detect and correct disparate impact (e.g., periodic bias reports, automatic variance for poverty-driven offenses, forbidding certain proxies)? Who has standing to challenge the metric or its application on equality grounds, and what remedies are available (remand vs. systemic revision)?\n\n5) Due process and democracy. Should Sâs component findings (e.g., abuse of trust, relational vulnerability, autonomy-loss severity) be elements of the offense (jury), sentencing factors (judge), or some hybrid? If hybrid, draw the line and justify it. Would you require periodic public hearings and legislative ratification for changes to S weights and cutpoints, as Prof. Chen suggests?\n\n6) Worked example. Please walk through a sample sentencing statement using S and PIS for the felony-murder scenario (armed robbery with loaded weapon; bystander killed; strong foresight of lethal risk; no intent to kill), showing: (i) S inputs and interval; (ii) band selection under the lenity rule; (iii) within-band choice based on PIS (incapacitation benefit, general deterrence from weapon-use enhancements, criminogenic costs), and (iv) any restorative conditions you would add.\n\n7) Capital punishment. Given your mixed viewâdesert as side-constraint; harm reduction as justificationâdo Chenâs uncertainty intervals and Holmâs error-costs/legitimacy analysis push you toward a practical moratorium on capital charging? If not, what charging and review structure would be necessary to pass your error-cost and non-arbitrariness tests (e.g., centralized charging, heightened proof standards, residual doubt review)?\n\nFinally, be candid about tradeoffs: where does institutional administrability force you to simplify Chenâs model, and what safeguards would you put in to keep simplifications from sliding back into Bedauâs arbitrariness?\n\n---\n\n### Speaker: Hon. Elena P. Villanueva\n\nThank you, Chair. Iâll be concrete and, where necessary, blunt about tradeoffs.\n\n1) Guideline architecture\n\n- Grid design tied to S-bands\n  - Map Prof. Chenâs S to seven seriousness bands. For administrability, each band has a narrow default range, plus a âsupervision tailâ and standard collateral orders.\n    - Band 7 (85â100): 15â25 years custody; 10â15 years supervision.\n    - Band 6 (75â85): 10â15 years custody; 8â12 years supervision.\n    - Band 5 (65â75): 7â12 years custody; 5â10 years supervision.\n    - Band 4 (55â65): 3â8 years custody; 3â7 years supervision.\n    - Lower bands scale accordingly.\n  - Within each band, the Commission publishes approved âmodality menusâ (custody; split custody; intensive community sanctions packages) so judges choose among equivalent options, not invent them ad hoc.\n\n- Departure rules when the 95% interval straddles thresholds\n  - Lenity default: if the credible interval crosses a band line, start in the lower band.\n  - Upward move despite lenity requires: (a) identification of the specific, modelârecognized facts that would resolve the uncertainty upward; (b) clear and convincing proof of those facts; (c) written reasons; and (d) automatic appellate review.\n  - If the interval spans more than two bands, treat as underdeterminate: convene a threeâjudge sentencing panel or remand for further fact-finding; prefer reversible sanctions (communityâbased controls) until the record is developed.\n\n- Trier and standard of proof for Sâaffecting facts\n  - Hybrid consistent with due process and Apprendi/Blakely principles:\n    - Any fact that increases the legally authorized ceiling (i.e., would permit sentencing in a higher Sâband than the offense of conviction otherwise authorizes) must be charged or admitted, and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n    - Facts that affect placement within the authorized band (e.g., degree of autonomy loss; risk embraced; abuse of trust when it does not raise the statutory maximum) are sentencing factors found by the judge under a clear and convincing standard.\n  - To minimize Apprendi friction, the Commission should align major offense degrees with band ceilings, so that most Sâcomponent findings operate within-band.\n\n2) Reasonâgiving and review\n\n- Required contents of the sentencing statement\n  1) Offense of conviction; applicable statutory maximum and the corresponding authorized Sâband.\n  2) The computed S, its components (C, H, R, T), and the 95% credible interval; attach the worksheet showing the item codings used.\n  3) Band selection: if lenity controlled, say so. If moving upward across a threshold, identify the specific facts, the evidence standard met, and why the lenity default is overcome.\n  4) Prevention analysis (PIS): summarize expected incapacitation benefit, general deterrence considerations (e.g., weaponâuse enhancements with empirical support), specific deterrence/rehabilitation prospects, and collateral costs (criminogenic, fiscal, legitimacy). Explain why the chosen modality and duration maximize prevention within the Sâband and respect dignity constraints.\n  5) Reparative conditions (if any): identify which are punitive (censureâbacked, nonâoptional) and which are restorative, the victimâs position, and the monitoring/enforcement plan.\n  6) Equality/bias checks: certify that no forbidden proxies were used; note any applicable structural mitigators and why.\n\n- Appellate standards of review\n  - S computation: legal questions de novo; item codings for which there is evidentiary dispute under clear error; adherence to lenity and trigger rules de novo.\n  - Band selection: if within the authorized band, abuse of discretion bounded by the grid; if crossing a band threshold upward, âheightened reasonablenessâ with independent review of whether the evidentiary standard was met and reasons were adequate.\n  - Withinâband choice: abuse of discretion, but the court must engage the PIS tradeoff; silence on prevention is reversible.\n\n3) Integrating reparative options\n\n- Authorization within bands\n  - Within any band, the Commission authorizes âvalidated restorative packagesâ that are punitive when imposed as censureâbacked, nonâoptional obligations (reparations funds, victimâapproved conferencing, community labor linked to harm, mandated treatment, letters of acknowledgment).\n  - Equivalency schedule: publish conversion guidelines (e.g., X hours of verified, skilled community work or a structured restitution plan with wageâgarnish plus participation in a mediated process equals Y months of custody), based on evidence of compliance and prevention valueâso equalâtreatment expectations are preserved.\n\n- Screening and safeguards\n  - Victim consent is required for direct encounters; victims may opt for indirect repair only.\n  - Risk screening with validated tools; disqualify highârisk violent offenders from fully communityâbased packages unless additional controls render risk acceptable (electronic monitoring, exclusion zones).\n  - Swiftâcertainâfair backstops: graduated, prompt sanctions for noncompliance; clear revocation routes back to custody; a single judge maintains jurisdiction to ensure continuity.\n\n4) Managing bias and background injustice\n\n- Auditing and remedial tools\n  - Quarterly disparateâimpact dashboards (race, ethnicity, gender, indigence), published by offense type, Sâband, and modality.\n  - Forbid proxies in S and PIS: race, ZIP code, education, employment status, and other socioâeconomic markers cannot be used directly or as âriskâ standâins.\n  - Structural mitigator: a narrowly defined âeconomic duressâ mitigator available where credible evidence shows the offense was substantially motivated by acute material need rather than predation, never applicable to highâharm violence; reduces C by one step with clear and convincing proof.\n  - Automatic equity variance: when dashboards show a statistically significant unexplained disparity within an offense category/band persisting for two consecutive quarters, trigger Commission review; authorize judges to apply a temporary downward variance presumption for the overâimpacted group pending corrective revision of the metric or practices.\n\n- Standing and remedies\n  - Standing: defendants; state public defender; attorney general; designated civil rights organizations; victim advocates (for disparate minimization of highâharm treatment).\n  - Remedies: caseâspecific remand for resentencing; injunctive relief requiring Commission to adjust items/weights; moratoria on use of particular factors; systemic revision with deadlines; independent monitor where necessary.\n\n5) Due process and democracy\n\n- Elements vs sentencing factors (hybrid)\n  - Elements (jury BRD): facts that raise the statutory maximum/band ceilingâe.g., âabuse of public officeâ if it authorizes Band 7; âuse of a loaded firearm in public robberyâ if it authorizes entry into a higher band.\n  - Sentencing factors (judge C&C): gradations of autonomy loss, risk embraced within the offense definition, relational vulnerability when it does not alter the statutory maximum, genuine remorse/assistance, provocation adequacy (if the legislature has created a partialâexcuse sentencing factor).\n  - Justification: preserves the juryâs constitutional role over exposure while allowing judges to do principled withinâband calibration with a higherâthanâpreponderance standard.\n\n- Democratic governance\n  - Yes: periodic public hearings and legislative ratification for any change to Î±âweights, band cutpoints, or dignity constraints every five years (with interim updates via noticeâandâcomment). Publish data and code. Require a supermajority of the Commission to alter guardrails that protect the independent role of culpability and risked harm.\n\n6) Worked example: felony murder (planned armed robbery; loaded weapon; bystander killed; strong foresight; no intent to kill)\n\n- S inputs (using Chenâstyle scoring)\n  - C: extreme recklessness regarding human life in service of predatory ends; planning; no intent to kill; no mitigation. C = 6.8 (95% CI 6.0â7.5).\n  - H: death. H = 9.6 (9.0â10.0).\n  - R: high ex ante lethal risk embraced in a public space with a loaded firearm; multiple persons exposed. R = 8.5 (7.8â9.1).\n  - T: no abuse of trust. T = 0.\n  - With Î±C=0.45, Î±H=0.35, Î±R=0.12, Î±T=0.08, SÌ â 74.4 with 95% CI â [67.8, 81.0].\n\n- Band selection\n  - The interval straddles the 75 cutpoint between Bands 5 and 6. Under lenity, Band 5 applies (7â12 yearsâ custody; 5â10 yearsâ supervision). The State seeks Band 6; I deny because the upward facts (risk embraced) are already captured in R and do not, on this record, meet the clear and convincing standard to overcome lenity.\n\n- Withinâband choice (PIS)\n  - Incapacitation benefit: actuarial indicators (prior weapon carrying, lifestyle criminality) suggest elevated forward risk; incapacitation yields nontrivial averted harm during custody.\n  - General deterrence: weaponâuse enhancements in public robberies have documented marginal deterrent effects (fewer guns carried when the certainty of enhancement is high). Severity beyond the top of Band 5 shows diminishing returns compared to investments in certainty/celerity.\n  - Specific deterrence/rehabilitation: credible programming available (CBT, vocational training); postârelease controls (long supervision; exclusion zones; firearm prohibitions).\n  - Collateral costs: long custodial terms carry criminogenic and fiscal costs; legitimacy costs are moderated by transparency and avoidance of strict liability.\n  - Choice: 11 yearsâ custody (top of Band 5), plus 8 yearsâ intensive supervision with zeroâtolerance firearm conditions; mandatory violentâoffender programming; exclusion zones around the robbery corridor; noâcontact orders with coâoffenders; and compliance monitoring.\n\n- Reparative conditions\n  - Punitiveâreparative: 10% of prison wages and 10% of postârelease earnings for five years paid into a victim compensation fund designated by the decedentâs family (censureâbacked, nonâoptional); a nonâcontact acknowledgment letter subject to the familyâs wishes; participation in a mediated impact panel if and only if the family consents. Swiftâcertainâfair consequences for noncompliance.\n\n- Sentencing statement (sketch)\n  - I would include the S components and interval, the lenity application, the PIS rationale (why 11/8 is the preventionâmaximizing point within the band), and an explicit acknowledgment that the absence of intent to kill places this case in Band 5 rather than 6 under our rules.\n\n7) Capital punishment\n\nGiven our mixed framework, Prof. Chenâs quantified uncertainty and Dr. Holmâs errorâcost/legitimacy analysis leave me no responsible space for capital charging in practice. The error rate is not vanishingly low; disparities persist; delay and deathârow conditions raise dignity concerns. I would recommend a practical moratorium.\n\nIf a jurisdiction insists on retaining it, the minimum structure would be:\n- Centralized statewide charging authority; racially blind charging screens; a requirement of at least two independent incriminating evidence streams (e.g., DNA or equivalent plus corroborated confession or reliable eyewitness).\n- Heightened proof: beyond a reasonable doubt plus a âresidual doubtâ safety valve permitting juries to choose LWOP where any nonâtrivial doubt remains.\n- Automatic proportionality review; âcomparative desertsâ analysis statewide; uniform protocols to eliminate countyâlevel variance.\n- Openâfile discovery; recorded interrogations; exclusion of uncorroborated jailhouse informants; validated forensics only.\n- Timeâbound appellate review to avoid decadesâlong limbo.\n\nI remain skeptical that these conditions can be durably met; absent that, abolition is the candid course.\n\nTradeoffs and safeguards\n\n- Simplifying Chenâs model\n  - We cannot run a bespoke Bayesian model in every courtroom. The Commission should preâcompute and publish a validated scoring instrument (structured worksheets and a digital tool) that implements the model with a limited, highâsignal set of items; freeze Î±âweights for a fiveâyear cycle; and provide onâbench guidance tables with preâcalculated credible intervals for common fact patterns.\n  - To avoid sliding back into arbitrariness:\n    - Keep bands narrow; require written reasons for any upward movement across a threshold.\n    - Mandate disclosure of the S worksheet in every case; prohibit âfreeâtextâ aggravation not mapped to recognized items.\n    - Institutionalize appellate policing of reasons; publish reversal rates by judge and county.\n    - Require annual bias audits and public hearings; sunset the instrument unless reauthorized after review of accuracy, equity, and usability.\n    - Train judges and counsel; certify riskâassessment vendors; prohibit use of blackâbox tools.\n\nTwo closing challenges to my colleagues\n\n- To Prof. Strauss: your moralâequivalence ceiling and my Sâbands converge operationally. The hard question is not whether to cap, but how to write caps so that line judges can apply them without reconstructing Kant on a Tuesday afternoon. Publishing weights, bands, and reasons is the price of legitimacy.\n\n- To Dr. Holm: prevention does the heavy lifting within bands, but I will not allow âlegitimacy costsâ to become a backâdoor desert proxy. Keeping S as a public ceiling/floor is how we keep our forwardâlooking calculus from drifting into expediency.\n\nThe aim is Bedauâs: mitigate arbitrariness. The tools are structured discretion, narrow bands, written reasons, and reviewâwith humility about what we donât know, and institutions that can correct course.\n\n---\n\n### Speaker: Host\n\nProf. Qureshi, Bedauâs A1 treats punishment as necessarily hard treatment (harm/suffering), and he worries that once we abandon talion, proportionality drifts. You reject A1 and R3, reframing desert as a claim to answer and repair. Iâd like you to make that vision operational and to confront the hardest cases.\n\n1) Conceptual core. If punishment need not be suffering, what makes a reparative disposition genuinely punitive rather than civil? Give necessary and sufficient features (e.g., authoritative censure, nonâoptional duties, linkage to the wrong, communicative rituals), and say whether you accept A2 as the gatekeeper. Where, if anywhere, is hard treatment required for grave wrongs, or can repair plus censure fully discharge the stateâs response?\n\n2) Proportionality of obligations. Sketch your metric for âproportional repairâ: what are the obligation dimensions (material restitution; timeâbound service; apology/acknowledgment; reintegration conditions; community benefit)? How do you calibrate weightings to autonomy loss and culpability without collapsing into Cardâs opacity or von Hirschâs arbitrariness? Could your metric be stated with the same transparency/uncertainty discipline Prof. Chen used for S (e.g., published weights; credible intervals; lenity triggers)?\n\n3) Worked examples (same as others):\n  a) Provoked killing (adequate provocation; immediate surrender; no prior violence) vs. felony murder (planned armed robbery with loaded weapon; bystander killed; clear foresight of lethal risk). What are the core reparative duties in each? What custodial, if any, remains once repair is undertaken? \n  b) Sexual assault: (i) stranger rape with weapon, confinement, terror; (ii) acquaintance assaults involving grooming and repetition. Specify obligations to the victim (if they consent), to the community, and to survivor services. If a victim declines engagement, what substitutes preserve accountability without reâtraumatization?\n\n4) Integration with S and PIS. Judge Villanueva authorized âvalidated restorative packagesâ within bands, and Dr. Holm wants prevention to drive withinâband choices. Do you:\n  - Treat reparative packages as presumptive within any band where validated risk is not high? \n  - Use Chenâs S as a ceiling and your obligations metric as the primary withinâband selector? \n  - Or do you propose a parallel track that can substitute for custody even in higher bands where repair is robust and risk is controllable? Please be explicit about screening (victim consent; risk tools), equivalency schedules (what counts as the punitive equivalent of Y monthsâ custody), and backstops for noncompliance.\n\n5) Equality and netâwidening. Dr. Baptiste will warn that restorative options often favor the resourced and netâwiden the system. What design features prevent that (e.g., slidingâscale restitution, guaranteed access to mediation/facilitators, exclusion of wealthâbased conditions, audits of disparate uptake)? Who gets to opt in, and how do you stop prosecutors from overâcharging to extract ârepair bargainsâ?\n\n6) Evidence. Point us to the best data on victim satisfaction, recidivism, and community safety from victimâoffender mediation and conferencing in seriousâviolence contexts. Where are the boundary conditions? What failures should make us revert to incapacitation?\n\n7) Engage the critics. \n  - Respond to Prof. Straussâs claim that for grave wrongs âsome hardâtreatment component remains required to register the gravity of the past choice.â Can censure plus robust obligations suffice without custodial pain? \n  - Address Dr. Holmâs legitimacy concern: if reparative outcomes vary caseâbyâcase with victim preferences, how do you preserve equal treatment and general deterrence signals? \n  - And to Judge Villanueva: how would your model fit the dueâprocess divisions she drew (what facts must a jury find; what counts as a punitive obligation that raises the penalty ceiling)?\n\n---\n\n### Speaker: Prof. Saira Qureshi\n\nThank you, Chair. Let me make the reparative alternative fully operational and meet the hard cases headâon.\n\n1) Conceptual core: when repair is punishment\n\n- Gatekeeper. I accept A2: penal liability attaches only upon proof of culpable offense.\n\n- Necessary and sufficient features of punitive reparation\n  1) Authoritative censure: a formal, public statement that the wrong was committed and condemned, addressed to the offender as answerable.\n  2) Nonâoptional duties: enforceable obligations imposed by the court; breach triggers swift, proportionate consequences.\n  3) Linkage: duties are substantively tied to the specific wrong (its harms, risks, relationships).\n  4) Dialogic accountability: structured opportunities to acknowledge, explain, apologize, and listen (directly only with victim consent; otherwise via surrogate/community).\n  5) Status work: a defined pathway to reintegration upon completion.\n\nIf those features are present, the disposition is penal, not merely civilâeven if the primary currency is repair rather than suffering.\n\n- Is hard treatment ever required? Only instrumentally: where risk cannot be responsibly managed in the community or where liberty restrictions are needed to enable safe and credible accountability. Custody is not ruled out, but its point is safety and the conditions for repairânot pain as payback.\n\n2) Proportionality of obligations: a transparent metric\n\nI propose an Obligations Index, O, calibrated to culpability and autonomy loss, with published weights and uncertainty intervals (mirroring Prof. Chenâs discipline).\n\nDimensions (scored on standardized scales; all duties timeâbound; slidingâscale for ability to pay)\n- Financial redress F: restitution to victims where apt; else payments to survivor services funds; assessed as a share of income to avoid wealth bias.\n- Service S: verified, skilled community service linked to the harm (e.g., violenceâinterruption, traumaâsupport logistics).\n- Accountability A: number and depth of facilitated sessions; written acknowledgment; where appropriate, a narrative accepted by the forum as owning the wrong.\n- Liberty limits L: curfews, exclusion zones, electronic monitoring, reporting frequencyâcalibrated to risk and to prevent further harm.\n- Change plan B: completion of evidenceâbased programs (e.g., violence, sexual behavior, substance use), with relapseâresponsive supports.\n- Reintegration R: education/work milestones; relational reparation to impacted communities.\n\nWeights. Publish Î±F, Î±S, Î±A, Î±L, Î±B, Î±R; set guardrails so no single dimension dominates. Tie the O target to an offenseâseriousness profile derived from C (culpability) and A* (autonomy/capability loss), each estimated as separate latent traits with credible intervals. Lenity and writtenâreasons rules apply when uncertainty straddles thresholds. Convert O into âburden pointsâ with a public equivalency schedule (e.g., one month of custody equals X burden points = Y hours of service + Z% income share + defined liberty limits); the schedule is a bridge for mixed regimes, not the moral basis of the disposition.\n\n3) Worked examples\n\na) Provoked killing vs felony murder\n\n- Provoked killing (adequate provocation; immediate surrender; no prior violence; low forward risk)\n  Core duties:\n  - F: incomeâbased payments into a dependentsâ support/memorial fund over 8â10 years.\n  - S: 800â1,200 hours of service in violence prevention or victimâsupport logistics across 3â5 years.\n  - A: formal apology; 6â10 facilitated sessions if the family consents, otherwise community panel acknowledgment.\n  - L: curfew, exclusion zones, reporting; firearm prohibition; 5â8 years.\n  - B: targeted selfâregulation/emotion programming; grief/trauma counseling.\n  - R: vocational/education completion.\n  Custody: not presumptively required if validated risk is low and duties are secured; initial residential programming may substitute for a short custodial term where structure is needed.\n\n- Felony murder (planned armed robbery; loaded weapon; clear foresight of lethal risk; bystander killed; elevated forward risk)\n  Core duties:\n  - F: incomeâbased payments to a homicide survivor fund and a gunâviolence prevention fund; longer horizon (10â12 years).\n  - S: 1,200â1,800 hours in violenceâinterruption/gunârisk education under tight supervision.\n  - A: acknowledgment and community forum; victimâfamily options as above.\n  - L: stringent liberty controls (curfew, GPS, exclusion of highârisk zones) for 8â12 years.\n  - B: intensive cognitiveâbehavioral and employment programs.\n  Custody: frontâloaded incapacitation is often warranted to manage risk and create space for change; but it should be the minimum necessary, with a clear conversion path to communityâbased obligations once risk is demonstrably down.\n\nb) Sexual assault\n\n- Stranger rape (weapon; confinement; terror)\n  Core duties:\n  - F: payments to survivor services; victimâdirected restitution only if the survivor asks.\n  - S: 1,200â1,800 hours in supervised roles not involving access to vulnerable persons; multiâyear horizon.\n  - A: only with survivor consent; otherwise surrogate panels. Nonâcontact acknowledgment is mandatory.\n  - L: robust controlsâGPS, exclusion zones, chaperone requirements in public venues, long supervision.\n  - B: longâterm, evidenceâbased sexual behavior treatment with external clinical audit.\n  Custody: likely necessary initially for safety with highârisk profiles; replaced by secure, therapeutic residential programs where available; the aim is to move to intensive, enforceable community controls as soon as risk allows.\n\n- Acquaintance assaults (grooming; repetition)\n  Core duties:\n  - F: survivorâservices funding; if survivor consents, tailored restitution.\n  - S: substantial service and prevention work focused on consent and power dynamics.\n  - A: structured acknowledgment; no contact orders; if the survivor declines engagement, accountability is to a community panel.\n  - L: strict relational boundaries, socialâmedia restrictions, exclusion from spaces with targets of prior grooming; long supervision.\n  - B: specialized treatment; bystanderâintervention work as part of service.\n  Custody: contingent on validated risk; many such cases can be managed with rigorous community regimes if controls and monitoring are tight.\n\nIf a victim declines any engagement, all accountability runs through community forums and written acknowledgment; the burdens remainâform varies, not magnitude.\n\n4) How this integrates with S and PIS\n\n- Presumption. Within any Sâband where validated risk is low or moderate, reparative packages are the default. In higher bands, they are authorized to substitute for some or all custody if O duties reach the bandâappropriate burden points and risk is controllable with L.\n\n- Interface. Use Chenâs S as ceiling/floor for severity; set O targets by band; pick the withinâband mix by prevention (Holmâs PIS). Publish an equivalency table: e.g., Band 5 requires 1,200â1,800 burden points; a package might be 900 hours service + 10% income share for 5 years + curfew/GPS for 4 years + treatment benchmarks.\n\n- Screening and backstops. Victim consent governs direct encounters; validated risk tools gate community placement; noncompliance triggers swift, proportionate sanctions, including conversion of unserved burden points to custody.\n\n5) Equality and netâwidening safeguards\n\n- Eligibility. Limit to cases otherwise facing custody; no adding RJ on top of minor sanctions.\n\n- Access. Independent, publicly funded facilitators; defense and community referrals allowed; prosecutors cannot monopolize the gateway.\n\n- Affordability. Incomeâbased payments with caps; service hours adjusted for caregiving and disability; never substitute cash for service.\n\n- Overâcharging checks. âNoâworseâoffâ rule: opting into repair cannot expose the defendant to a harsher custodial fallback than the standard guideline.\n\n- Audits. Quarterly uptake and outcome audits by race, class, and neighborhood; corrective action if disparities persist without justification.\n\n6) Evidence and boundary conditions\n\n- Victims. RCTs and quasiâexperiments (e.g., UK Justice Research Consortium; Canberra RISE) show markedly higher victim satisfaction and reduced PTSD symptoms after conferencing compared to court; seriousâviolence victimâoffender dialogues conducted postâconviction show strong mentalâhealth gains.\n\n- Recidivism. For violent offenses, several trials found reductions relative to court processing; effects are programâ and contextâdependent. Adult sexual violence evidence is thinner; what we have supports riskâresponsive treatment plus strict controls, with any dialogic element contingent on survivor consent.\n\n- Boundary conditions for reverting to incapacitation. High, persistent risk despite compliant engagement; repeated breaches of core safety conditions; credible evidence of ongoing coercive control; refusal of all accountability duties. Incapacitation is then justified as a safety measure, not as a quantum of pain.\n\n7) Engaging the criticisms\n\n- To Prof. Strauss: registering gravity does not require calibrated suffering. It requires calibrated accountability. A multiâyear, lifeâreordering set of obligationsâpublic censure, sustained service tied to the wrong, income redirection, tight liberty limits, and faceâtoâface answerability where the survivor invites itâcan communicate condemnation and restore normative equilibrium more truthfully than warehousing. Pain may occur as a byâproduct; it is not the point.\n\n- To Dr. Holm: equal treatment and deterrence are preserved by standardization. The O targets are set by Sâbands, not by victim preference. Victims may shape the form (direct vs surrogate), not the burden. Deterrence flows from certainty of censure and durable consequences, not from everâlonger custody. We should invest in raising the certainty of reparative accountability.\n\n- To Judge Villanueva: due process fits cleanly.\n  - Elements for jury beyond a reasonable doubt: facts that authorize higher Sâband ceilings (e.g., weapon use; abuse of trust) and any aggravator that would permit higher O targets than the offense of conviction otherwise allows.\n  - Sentencing factors for judge by clear and convincing: the specific composition of O within the ceiling (hours, payment shares, libertyâlimit intensity), validated risk level, victim consent to direct encounters.\n  - Any increase above the default O target for the band requires written reasons and automatic review; victim refusal cannot raise the burden.\n\nA final note. Bedauâs worry about drift once talion is gone is real. The way to avoid it is not to relapse into a proportionality of pain, but to discipline a proportionality of obligations: publish the weights and conversion rules, report uncertainty, default to lenity, and allow democratic revision. Where repair can deliver censure, safety, and restoration, carceral hardâtreatment is presumptively unjust. Where it cannot, we incapacitate to the minimum necessaryâand still bind that deprivation to dialogic accountability rather than to suffering as an end.\n\n---\n\n### Speaker: Host\n\nDr. Baptiste, Bedau channels Murphyâs critique that âunfairâadvantageâ justifications presuppose a just background order and so cannot legitimate punishment under nonâideal conditions. Weâve now heard an elaborate technocratic answer to arbitrariness (Chenâs S with guardrails; Villanuevaâs structured discretion; Holmâs PIS) and two normative anchors (Straussâs deontic ceiling; Qureshiâs reparative substitution). I want you to press the structural question and then get concrete.\n\n1) Structural diagnosis. Do Sâbands, PIS, and guideline grids merely launder classed and racialized domination under a veneer of proportionality? Identify specific points where bias enters despite Chenâs exclusions: e.g., item content (autonomyâloss valuations), offense definitions (property vs wageâtheft asymmetries), policing inputs (weapon use, publicâspace risk), and âlegitimacy costsâ that may smuggle desert back in. Give us a couple of case comparisons where the same social harm distributes differently across race/class (drug markets; survival theft; tax and environmental crimes) and show how the proposed schemes would still misfire.\n\n2) Replacement architecture. If R3 collapses under injustice and R2âs calibration is structurally tainted, what is the alternative justificatory frame? Sketch your preferred minimal penal footprint: which harms (if any) remain within penal sanction, and why? Do you retain A2/R1 as liability gates or move to nonâpenal regulation entirely (fines, licenses, civil protection, administrative incapacitation)? Be explicit about the normative principle (e.g., antiâdomination, public health, capabilities) that does the justificatory work.\n\n3) Highâharm violence. For intimateâpartner and sexual violenceâthe hardest casesâwhat does a decarceral but safetyâfirst regime look like in practice? Specify the mix: protective orders, electronic/geofencing controls, income supports and housing for survivors, specialized prevention and treatment, and when (if ever) you still authorize custodial incapacitation. How do you avoid reproducing patriarchal/racial harms through surveillance tools?\n\n4) Restorative justice under nonâideal conditions. Qureshi proposes âobligations of repairâ as presumptive. Youâve warned elsewhere about netâwidening and access bias. What design features are nonânegotiable to prevent RJ becoming a status weapon (e.g., slidingâscale monetary duties; independent gateways; banning overâcharging to extract repair; community governance)? Where do you draw a hard line that triggers incapacitation instead?\n\n5) Institutional program. Put numbers on it. If you were chairing a reform commission, what decarceration target (percentage and timeline) would you set, which offense categories would you divert first, and how would you reallocate dollars to housing/health/education? What metricsâbeyond recidivismâwould you use to evaluate success (e.g., community safety, survivor wellâbeing, reduced racial disparities, material security indices)?\n\n6) Engage the panel. \n   - To Chen/Villanueva: if we keep an S ceiling, what additional antiâdomination guardrails must be added (e.g., automatic downward adjustments tied to measures of structural deprivation; presumptive diversion for povertyâdriven offenses)?\n   - To Strauss: does âmoral accountingâ risk reâinscribing social hierarchies when the material preconditions of agency are unequal? What would a deontic theory look like that conditions punishment on distributive justice audits?\n   - To Holm: can âlegitimacy costsâ be operationalized without importing community sentiments that are themselves racialized? Whatâs the methodological fix?\n\n7) Death penalty. Give us your structural abolition case in two moves: (a) why capital punishment is inseparable from racialized state violence even under refurbished procedures; and (b) why the resources consumed by capital systems should be reallocated, specifying which survivorâsupport and communityâsafety programs yield the largest returns.\n\nPlease donât just critiqueâdesign. Offer at least two concrete rule changes or statutory provisions you would draft tomorrow that would move us toward your model while addressing Bedauâs charge that theories must speak to actual institutions, not just ideals.\n\n---\n\n### Speaker: Dr. Nolan Baptiste\n\nThank you, Chair. Let me take Bedauâs invitationâreally Murphyâsâand keep us in nonâideal space. Under background injustice, âfairâplayâ/unfairâadvantage stories (R3) donât justify inflicting hard treatment; they presuppose the very distributive floor thatâs missing. And a great deal of what weâre calling R2âhowever refinedâtravels with background power. Iâll diagnose where, then give you an alternative architecture with rules you can draft tomorrow.\n\n1) Structural diagnosis: where âmeasured proportionalityâ launders domination\n\nEven with Prof. Chenâs exclusions and Judge Villanuevaâs guardrails, bias seeps in at design, data, and doctrine.\n\n- Item content and valuations:\n  - Autonomyâloss scales are normâladen. Whose âcredibleârisk environmentâ counts as severe? A woman in a gated suburb vs a woman in public housing? If panels are demographically skewed or culturally framed, S bakes in middleâclass white sensibilities despite best efforts.\n  - âAbuse of trust/officeâ aggravates for a public official but not for an employer who steals wages or uses ICE threats to coerce. The latter is structurally trustâviolating, yet typically sits outside high bands.\n\n- Offense definitions:\n  - Street drug sales are felonies keyed to place, proximity to schools, and âpublic nuisanceâ; suburban delivery markets and cryptomarkets with the same volumes are less policed, coded as ânonâpublic,â and trigger fewer aggravators. S and PIS punish the overâpoliced market as âriskier,â entrenching placeâbased inequality.\n  - Survival theft is a felony at low thresholds in many states; wage theft and tax evasion that dwarf it in aggregate harm are misdemeanors or civil. S canât fix asymmetrical criminalization.\n\n- Policing inputs and measurement:\n  - Weaponâuse and âpublicâspace riskâ aggravators are observed where police saturate. The presence of a gun is detected in Black neighborhoods; the same gun in a white living room is never measured. Risk isnât just higher; measurement error is nonrandom and racialized.\n  - âCommunity legitimacy costsâ risks smuggling back desert through majoritarian sentiments that are themselves racialized. If you weight PIS by âwhat the public will accept,â you reinscribe who the public imagines as dangerous.\n\n- Case comparisons (same social harm, different class/race):\n  - Drug markets: Streetâcorner seller (Black, surveilled) with a pistol â S spikes on R (risked harm) and H (credibleârisk environment); PIS favors severity for general deterrence of weapon carry. Private network seller (white, unarmed) with larger volumes â lower S and PIS. Social harm equal or higher in the latter, but the scheme punishes the former.\n  - Survival theft vs wage/tax theft: A homeless mother shoplifts $200 of formula, scuffles at the exit (R goes up). A contractor steals $20,000 in wages across 10 workers; a high earner cheats $50,000 in taxes. The latterâs aggregate H is far higher; S (as currently conceived) centers immediate physical autonomy losses and underweights diffuse economic harms. The result is inverted seriousness.\n  - Environmental crime: Lead emitter poisoning a census tract vs aggravated robbery with no injury. Populationâlevel capability loss dwarfs robbery harms. Yet Sâs H/R items are built for acute incidents; environmental crimes slip into low bands.\n\nConclusion: you can sanitize inputs and publish weights, but under nonâideal criminal codes and policing, Sâbands, PIS, and grids still allocate coercion along classed and racial lines.\n\n2) Replacement architecture: antiâdomination/publicâhealth frame; a minimal penal footprint\n\n- Justificatory principle: antiâdomination plus public health. The state may use coercion only to prevent ongoing subordination (interpersonal or structural) and serious, imminent physical harm, and only after it has met baseline duties (housing, income, health care) that enable lawful compliance. Coercion must be the least subordinating effective means.\n\n- Liability gate: retain R1/A2 minimallyâculpable conduct is necessary for any penal responseâbut add a distributive precondition: no custodial hard treatment absent a finding that the state provided baseline capabilities reasonably accessible to the person. Exhaustion of nonâpenal measures is required.\n\n- What remains penal: a narrow classâ(i) ongoing lethal violence; (ii) demonstrable coercive control with high imminent risk; (iii) organized offenses that pose serious bodily harm where administrative controls fail. Everything else shifts to nonâpenal regulation:\n  - Civil protection and exclusion orders with swift, nonâcustodial enforcement.\n  - Licensing, bonding, and administrative incapacitation for dangerous practices (e.g., revoke corporate charters; bar licenses).\n  - Fines and restitution keyed to income/wealth; debarment; corporate monitorships.\n  - Publicâhealth interventions: overdose prevention, syringe access, MOUD for substance use; housingâfirst.\n\n3) Highâharm violence: a decarceral, safetyâfirst regime\n\n- Core safety stack:\n  - Immediate protective orders; firearm relinquishment within 24â48 hours with verified compliance.\n  - Subsidized emergency relocation, lock changes, and guaranteed income/housing for survivors; legal advocacy.\n  - Electronic/geofencing controls on the respondent, timeâlimited and strictly overseen; realâtime response protocols coâdesigned with community advocates.\n  - Specialized IPV/SA units staffed with clinicians and culturallyâcompetent advocates; evidenceâbased treatment for persons who offend (where they engage) and batterer intervention programs that meet standards.\n\n- Custodial threshold: authorize incapacitation only upon judicial finding, on clear and convincing evidence, of high imminent risk (validated tool plus qualitative evidence) or repeated, willful violations of safety orders; impose the minimum term necessary to break the sequence; pair with mandated treatment; periodic review.\n\n- Avoid reproducing harms:\n  - Data minimization (no sharing EM data with immigration or predictive policing); strict sunsets; independent community oversight boards with survivor representation; audits of racialized EM deployment and violation responses; graduated, proportionate responses to technical violations.\n\n4) Restorative justice under nonâideal conditions: design to prevent status weaponization\n\n- Nonânegotiables:\n  - Slidingâscale monetary duties and caps; service obligations capped per month; never allow wealth to buy down time.\n  - Independent gateways: courtâappointed RJ coordinators with authority independent of prosecution; eligibility based on offense/risk criteria, not bargaining leverage.\n  - Ban âRJ as leverageâ: statutory prohibition on charging up to extract repair; ânoâworseâoffâ ruleâopting into RJ cannot produce a harsher custodial fallback than the guideline baseline.\n  - Community governance: boards composed of survivors and formerly incarcerated persons to set curricula, select facilitators, and audit outcomes; publish demographics of uptake and completion.\n\n- Hard lines for incapacitation: credible lethal threats; stalking with weapons; tampering with monitors tied to safety orders; repeated, escalating violations. Otherwise, repair plus controls are presumptive.\n\n5) Institutional program: targets, sequence, dollars, metrics\n\n- Decarceration target: 50% reduction in prison population in 5 years; 75% in 10.\n  - Phase 1 (24 months): presumptive diversion for drug possession; lowâlevel sales under a threshold; nonâburglary property under a raised felony floor; technical violations of supervision; parole detainers for nonviolent conduct. Goal: 30% reduction.\n  - Phase 2 (years 3â5): expand to burglary without injury; felony theft under $5,000; nonâweapon robberies with no injury; shorten lengths across remaining categories with earnedâtime. Goal: another 20%.\n\n- Reallocation: assume $50â80k per prisonâyear saved. Redirect 60% to housingâfirst slots; 20% to mobile crisis and mentalâhealth; 10% to IPV/SA survivor services; 10% to youth employment/violenceâinterruption. Publish a lineâitem âjustice reinvestmentâ ledger.\n\n- Success metrics (publicly reported quarterly):\n  - Violent victimization rate per 100,000 (disaggregated by neighborhood and race).\n  - Survivor wellâbeing indices (housing stability; PTSD symptom scales; satisfaction with system responses).\n  - Racial disparity index in arrests, charging, sentencing, and sanctions.\n  - Material security indices (housing stability; poverty rate; youth school attendance).\n  - Clearance rates for serious violence (and time to charge).\n  - Community trust measures (procedural justice surveys) with oversamples of marginalized groups.\n\n6) Engagements with the panel\n\n- To Prof. Chen and Judge Villanueva: if S stays as a ceiling, add antiâdomination guardrails:\n  - Structural Deprivation Adjustment: when a defendantâs neighborhood deprivation index or individual deprivation markers exceed a statutory threshold (homelessness; food insecurity), automatic oneâband downward shift unless the state proves it met baseline provision duties; this is not âexcuse,â itâs a distributive precondition.\n  - Presumptive diversion for povertyâdriven offenses (codified definition).\n  - Require an âAggregate Harm Moduleâ in S for corporate, environmental, wage, and tax crimesâso aggregate capability losses can place such cases into Bands 6â7.\n  - Forbid policeâonly data feeds for S items; require corroboration from nonâpolice sources (medical/clinical, community affidavits) for riskedâharm assessments. DIF tests and disparateâimpact audits must be binding: if bias persists, weights are suspended by rule.\n\n- To Prof. Strauss: your moral accounting presumes agents had fair chances to comply. A deontic theory under nonâideal conditions must condition punitive eligibility on a Distributive Justice Audit: did the state meet duties that make the norm one we can fairly expect compliance with? If the answer is âno,â only minimal liability (R1/A2) remainsâand only reparative, nonâcarceral duties are permissible, save imminent safety cases.\n\n- To Dr. Holm: âlegitimacy costsâ canât be measured by raw public sentiment. Methodological fix: vignetteâbased, blinded surveys that mask race/class cues; reweight samples to correct for racial/SES imbalances; validate against behavior (reporting and cooperation rates) rather than stated attitudes. Publish the models; forbid use of âcommunity fearâ metrics derived from media or social media which are racially skewed.\n\n7) Death penalty: structural abolition\n\n- Inseparability from racialized state violence:\n  - Countyâlevel lynching rates predict modern death sentencing; the victimâs race drives capital charging; âheinousnessâ maps onto racialized narratives of dangerousness. Centralized charging and blind screens cannot erase the cultural sediment. Capital punishment functions as a status ritual of domination.\n\n- Reallocation:\n  - Each capital case imposes $1â3 million in marginal costs over LWOP. Abolish; reallocate to:\n    - Homicide clearance squads (evidenceâbased training; forensic capacity). Clearing homicides deters more reliably than executions.\n    - Survivor support: longâterm financial stipends; traumaâinformed counseling; relocation funds.\n    - Hospitalâbased violence intervention; credibleâmessenger programs; youth jobsâprograms with demonstrated reductions in shootings.\n\nTwo draftable rules/statutes for tomorrow\n\n- Distributive Preconditions for Custody Act:\n  - âNo court shall impose a custodial sentence unless it finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (a) the defendant, during the relevant period, had access to baseline housing, health care, and income supports sufficient to meet basic needs; and (b) nonâpenal, less restrictive alternativesâincluding civil protection, reparative obligations, and administrative controlsâhave been attempted or are demonstrably inadequate to prevent imminent serious harm. Absent such findings, the sentence shall consist solely of nonâcustodial measures. An exception lies for cases with a judicial finding of high imminent risk of serious bodily harm.â\n  - Pair with a state duty: âThe court shall order the responsible agency to provide the baseline supports as a condition of any supervision.â\n\n- Equal Harms Enforcement and Corporate Accountability Act:\n  - âFor offenses defined by aggregate harms (environmental pollution causing measurable health losses; wage theft above $5,000; tax fraud above $10,000), the seriousness index shall include an Aggregate Harm score reflecting populationâlevel capability losses; such offenses are eligible for Bands 6â7. The Attorney General shall establish a Corporate Crime Unit; felony liability extends to responsible executives where willful or reckless endangerment is shown. Annual reports shall compare enforcement intensity and Sâband usage across violent and aggregateâharm categories.â\n\nAdd two more cleanâup provisions:\n- Presumptive Diversion for PovertyâDriven Offenses: codify a rebuttable presumption of nonâcustodial, reparative sanctions where credible evidence shows material need as primary driver and no injury occurred.\n- Technical Violations Reform: prohibit incarceration for technical supervision violations absent a new arrest for violent conduct; require graduated, nonâcustodial responses.\n\nClosing thought\n\nBedau asked for a theory that speaks to institutions. The throughâline of my proposals is simple: under nonâideal conditions, retribution (R3) is not available, and proportionality (R2) is not neutral. If we keep any penal power, it must be subordinated to antiâdomination and public health; it must be minimized; and it must be conditioned on the state doing its distributive part. If we retain Prof. Chenâs S at all, embed it in that frameâwith structural adjustments, distributive audits, and enforcement parity for aggregate harmsâlest âdoing justiceâ become the latest language in which we reproduce the very hierarchies punishment claims to condemn.\n\n< END TRANSCRIPT >', name=None, tool_call_id=None, tool_calls=None, tool_output=None)] tool_calls=[{'name': 'participant_prompt', 'parameters': {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'participant': {'type': 'string', 'description': 'The name of the participant (exactly how it appears in the bios after Name: ).
