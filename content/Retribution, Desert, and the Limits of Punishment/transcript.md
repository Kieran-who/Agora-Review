### Speaker: Host

Professor Strauss, Bedau treats R3 as “moral alchemy” and doubts that retributivism can offer a nonconsequentialist general justification. You’ve defended a neo‑Kantian reconstruction that frames R3 as a requirement of moral accounting and respect for agency. Could you spell out that justificatory structure: what is it, exactly, about responsible past wrongdoing that makes intentional hard treatment not only permissible but required, without smuggling in preventive goods? And why, on your view, may the guilty be intentionally harmed while the innocent may not?

On the nature of punishment, Bedau adds A1 and A2. Do you regard hard treatment (harm/suffering) as a constitutive element (A1), or can reparative sanctions without suffering still count as punishment within a retributive framework? Where, if anywhere, do you place communicative/restorative elements—side constraints, substitutes, or integral to retributive punishment?

Turning to proportionality, Bedau argues that once we abandon literal lex talionis, R2 becomes indeterminate or arbitrary. You propose a “moral equivalence metric” that integrates culpability and harm while forbidding instrumentalization. How does your metric avoid the Card and von Hirsch pitfalls he diagnoses (measurement opacity; collapsing seriousness into harm; arbitrary penalty schedules)? Could you walk us through a concrete case—say, provoked killing versus felony murder, or sexual assault with different autonomy losses—showing how culpability and harm are weighted and how the upper and lower bounds are set?

Finally, on capital punishment: you’ve argued narrow eligibility where culpability is maximal with near‑perfect procedures. Given Bedau’s epistemic skepticism and arbitrariness concerns, does your deontic reconstruction leave any real space for the death penalty in practice, or does it collapse into abolition under current conditions? What empirical or procedural thresholds would be necessary to clear your deontic hurdles?

---

### Speaker: Prof. Miriam K. Strauss

Thank you. Let me take the questions in sequence.

1) Reconstructing R3 as moral accounting, not moral alchemy

Hart’s label “moral alchemy” makes R3 sound like a crude hedonic balancing: add suffering to wrongdoing and somehow we get moral gold. That caricatures the deontic structure. On my view, culpable wrongdoing is not just a bad state of the world; it is a normative act. In willing an assault or a fraud, the offender sets his agency against another’s standing as an equal. That past act generates directed second‑personal claims: the victim has a claim to be answered; the polity, as the public agent of equal freedom, has a claim to demand that answer; and the offender has a correlative duty to account for what he has done.

Punishment is the institutional form of that moral accounting. It has three elements:
- Authoritative censure that addresses the agent as the responsible author of the wrong.
- A non‑optional burden linked to the wrong, through which the agent bears the cost of his choice rather than externalizing it onto the victim and community.
- A status adjustment that restores the normative equilibrium: it marks that the wrong has been taken up and answered, and that the offender reenters the order of mutual accountability.

This does not smuggle in preventive goods. Even if no one else learns of the punishment, and even if the offender is undeterrable, we still owe the accounting to the victim and to the idea of equal agency. Conversely, because the point is answerability, it explains why only the guilty may be intentionally harmed: culpable wrongdoing changes one’s normative position. By one’s own past will, one has incurred liability to hard treatment as part of answering for that will. The innocent have incurred no such liability. To harm them intentionally for any further good would be to instrumentalize them. So R3, properly reconstructed, is not “suffering-for-its-own-sake”; it is a deontic requirement to settle a moral debt in a way that respects the offender as a responsible chooser.

2) A1 and A2; the place of repair and communication

I accept A2 outright: guilt is the gatekeeper for penal eligibility. On A1, I take “hard treatment” to be constitutive in the following modest sense: punishment must impose a non‑optional burdensome demand that communicates censure. But the burden need not be optimized for suffering. Reparative sanctions can count as punishment when and because they are imposed as authoritative, non‑optional duties of repair that carry the institution’s censure. A well‑designed restitution order, compulsory participation in a victim–offender conference, or a constraint that funds trauma care can be punitive if it is imposed as part of the moral accounting, not merely as a civil remedy or a voluntary good deed.

Communicative and restorative elements are not optional adornments; they are integral to retributive punishment’s point. Without communication and opportunities for re‑acceptance of the norm, hard treatment risks becoming mere pain delivery. At the same time, for grave wrongs, repair alone will rarely discharge the whole debt; some hard-treatment component remains required to register the gravity of the past choice. The structure is “censure plus accountable burden,” with repair able to discharge part of the burden when genuine and appropriately linked to the wrong.

3) Proportionality without talion: the moral equivalence metric

I agree with Bedau that literal talion is untenable, and I share his worry about arbitrariness once talion is gone. My “moral equivalence metric” tries to avoid both Card’s measurement opacity and von Hirsch’s collapse into harm by:

- Two independent cores:
  1) Culpability: reason‑responsiveness at the time of action (purpose, knowledge, recklessness, negligence), quality of reasons (malice, predation), partial excuses (provocation, duress), and impairments that undermine answerability. No strict liability: felony outcomes are graded by risk taken and foreseeability, not by doctrinal imputation.
  2) Harm and risk: not merely physical injury but rights-based losses, including autonomy deprivation, duration, multiplicity, creation of a credible-risk environment, and long-term capability losses. Here I take seriously feminist insights about lived, intersectional impacts in sexual and domestic violence.

- Aggravating relational wrongs: abuse of trust or public office, exploitation of vulnerability.

- Dignity constraints: penalties must not degrade or instrumentalize; they must be consistent with treating the person as an end. This rules out sexualized, mutilative, or terrorizing punishments regardless of “fit.”

- Ranges with uncertainty: we map seriousness to sentencing bands, not points, and we publish the weights and their confidence intervals. Following Prof. Chen’s work, the scale is empirical and revisable: we validate components against community judgments, victim-impact research, and comparative case review, and we flag cases where uncertainty is high so that appellate oversight and reason-giving are mandatory. Judge Villanueva’s structured discretion is then the institutional guardrail.

Two concrete applications

a) Provoked killing vs felony murder

- Provoked killing (adequate provocation; intentional but in heat of passion; no prior cruelty; immediate aftermath confession and assistance):
  Culpability: baseline “purpose to kill” is the highest level. Significant provocation is a partial excuse because it impairs self-control without negating reasons-responsiveness. I would reduce two levels (from 5 to 3 on a 0–5 culpability scale).
  Harm: death is maximal (5), with adjustments for multiplicity or torture not present here.
  Relational aggravation: none.
  Result: Seriousness places the case in a high but not maximal band. As a concrete guide, a jurisdiction might set a presumptive range of 8–12 years’ incarceration plus mandatory censure and reparative obligations (support to dependents of the deceased, memorial fund), with reasoned departures allowed only on written justification.

- Felony murder (armed robbery with a loaded weapon; death of a bystander during a foreseeable confrontation; no purpose to kill; substantial prior planning for the felony):
  Culpability: no intention to kill; but extreme recklessness regarding lethal risk in the service of predatory ends merits a culpability of 3–4 depending on the evidence of foresight. I reject strict liability imputation: the grade rises with the degree of risk embraced, not just the felony label.
  Harm: death (5).
  Relational aggravation: predation using weapons in public space adds modest aggravation.
  Result: Often this will sit in a band above the provoked killing when the risk-taking is extreme and chosen for predation (e.g., 12–20 years). Where the lethal outcome was a freak accident against moderate risk, it should fall below (e.g., 7–12 years). The key is transparent grading of risk and foresight.

b) Sexual assault with different autonomy losses

- Stranger rape with weapon, confinement, and threats of further harm:
  Culpability: purpose to sexually violate; planning; explicit terrorization (5).
  Harm: profound autonomy deprivation, enduring trauma and credible-risk environment (4–5), plus confinement and weapon use as aggravators.
  Result: Maximal non-homicide band (e.g., 12–18 years), plus long-term supervision and non-contact orders, alongside reparative obligations. No sexualized penalties; dignity constraints bind.

- Acquaintance assault involving grooming, exploitation of intoxication, and repeated incidents:
  Culpability: purpose to violate; exploitation of vulnerability and trust (5), with relational aggravation for grooming and repetition.
  Harm: possibly fewer physical injuries on a given occasion, but greater long-term autonomy loss from repetition and social entanglement; the metric must capture that (3–4 with upward adjustments for repetition).
  Result: Comparable or higher band than the stranger case if the pattern shows domination over time. Reparative duties are mandatory but cannot displace the custodial core; within-band mitigation is possible where the offender undertakes genuine, victim‑respecting repair and acknowledges wrongdoing.

These illustrations show three features I think Bedau rightly demands: culpability is assessed independently of harm; “seriousness” is not a black box; and mapping to penalties is by transparent bands with reason-giving, subject to appellate review and periodic recalibration.

4) Capital punishment under a deontic reconstruction

Conceptually, the metric leaves narrow space for capital punishment: only where culpability is maximal (purposeful, repeated, or mass killings; terrorism; genocide), no substantial mitigation, and where the community’s most severe hard treatment is necessary to complete the moral accounting without violating dignity. But two further constraints matter:

- Epistemic threshold: the system must achieve a demonstrably vanishingly low risk of wrongful conviction in capital‑eligible cases. At minimum: recorded interrogations; open‑file discovery; exclusion of uncorroborated jailhouse informants; validated forensics; robust defense funding; racially blind charging screens; multiple independent lines of inculpatory evidence (DNA or equivalent); and an institutionalized “residual doubt” safety valve. I would want credible, prospective audits showing an error rate well below one per thousand, with narrow confidence intervals across subpopulations.

- Non‑arbitrariness: capital charging and sentencing must be uniform statewide (or nationally), with centralized charging authority, guideline constraints, written reasons, and automatic, expedited review; documented elimination of race, county, and wealth effects; and execution protocols that avoid both degradation and long delays that themselves become cruel.

On present evidence, these conditions are not met. Error rates are non‑trivial; disparities are persistent; and the combination of delay and death row conditions undermines dignity constraints. So although my deontic account does not rule out the death penalty in principle, in practice it points toward abolition under current conditions. The maximal hard treatment consistent with agency‑respect will be lifelong incapacitation under humane conditions, coupled with an architecture of censure and structured opportunities for acknowledgment and partial repair.

A final note of challenge

Leif’s purely preventive frame cannot explain the asymmetry between guilty and innocent: if harm reduction is the only currency, scapegoating in rare high‑stakes cases is, in principle, eligible. Fingarette’s conceptual internalism, by contrast, risks erasing the difference between authoritative norms and just punishment of breaches. A legal order may conceptually call for censure; it does not thereby morally license the whole menu of hard treatments. The deontic accounting view secures both: it explains why punishment is owed to the past act and why its forms are constrained by dignity. And it gives us a disciplined way, through a transparent metric and institutional guardrails, to avoid the indeterminacy that rightly troubles Bedau.

### Speaker: Host

Dr. Holm, Prof. Strauss argues that a purely preventive account cannot explain the asymmetry between guilty and innocent—if harm reduction is the only currency, scapegoating sometimes looks eligible in principle. From within a nonretributive framework, what grounds the categorical bar on intentionally harming the innocent and the corresponding permission to impose hard treatment only on those who are guilty (R1/A2), without quietly importing desert? Is it rule‑consequentialist legitimacy, epistemic error costs, or something else? Please be explicit about the normative structure.

On proportionality (R2), Bedau worries that once talion is abandoned, harm‑based scales either collapse into arbitrariness (von Hirsch) or measurement opacity (Card). You favor a pragmatic R2 anchored to social harm and risk, not desert. What would a determinate, preventive proportionality look like? Could you work through the same two contrasts Strauss discussed—(a) provoked killing vs. felony murder; (b) two rape scenarios—and show how a harm‑reduction metric would set ranges, emphasizing incapacitation, risk to reoffend, and marginal deterrence? Where would your recommendations diverge from her moral‑equivalence bands, and why?

Methodologically, do you accept Prof. Chen’s multidimensional seriousness indices and uncertainty intervals as a decision aid for a preventive regime? If so, which dimensions map to preventive goals (e.g., victim capability losses as predictors of social harm; culpability as a proxy for future risk)? If not, what is the alternative measurement strategy that avoids Bedau’s arbitrariness charge?

Finally, on capital punishment: given current evidence on certainty, swiftness, and severity, do you see any credible marginal deterrent or incapacitative case that survives error‑costs and legitimacy losses? If not, say so plainly. And take a stand on Strauss’s closing challenge: can a purely preventive theory vindicate the guilty/innocent asymmetry without help from R3’s moral accounting?

---

### Speaker: Dr. Leif Anders Holm

Thank you. Let me be as clear as I can about the nonretributive architecture I’m working with.

1) Guilty/innocent asymmetry without R3

My framework has two layers:

- Telos: reduce future victimization (expected social harm).
- Legitimacy side‑constraints that are not “desert” claims but conditions for the preventive project to be effective and permissible in a liberal order.

Those constraints are justified on rule‑consequentialist and public‑reason grounds, not on moral accounting for past wrongs.

- No intentional harm to innocents. As a standing rule this is a dominance strategy for harm reduction. Once the public believes the state will sometimes sacrifice innocents “for the greater good,” you get cascading losses: less reporting and cooperation with police, lower compliance with the law, jury nullification, and decreased perceived fairness. The empirical literature on procedural justice and legal compliance is straightforward: legitimacy begets cooperation and self‑regulation. Even if you could concoct a “rare scapegoat” case where net harms fall locally, adopting such a practice as a rule destroys the informational and cooperative ecosystem that crime control depends on. Add the epistemic problem: because we can’t identify those “rare” cases reliably ex ante, a carve‑out becomes a mechanism for error and abuse. So the rule “do not intentionally punish the innocent” is not smuggled desert; it’s a system‑level constraint without which prevention fails in equilibrium.

- Why hard treatment may be imposed on the guilty. Not because they “owe” it, but because: (a) they are the locus where incapacitation and specific deterrence have nontrivial expected effects; (b) linking sanctions to actual wrongdoing is required to keep the deterrence signal informative. If sanctions decouple from culpable conduct, the signal‑to‑noise ratio collapses and general deterrence erodes. A2 (eligibility upon guilt) is thus a fairness constraint instrumental to credible, cooperative crime control. Proof standards, due process, and error‑minimizing procedures are part of that same legitimacy bundle.

Call this preventive legitimacy: a package of non‑desert constraints necessary for the state to reduce harm without provoking larger harms through mistrust, error, and abuse.

2) Preventive proportionality (R2) without talion

“Proportionality,” for me, is not a metaphysical fit; it’s the requirement that the incremental severity and modality of a sanction be justified by marginal prevention benefits net of costs. A determinate preventive R2 evaluates:

- Incapacitation benefit: expected averted harm from not being at liberty during the sanction.
- Specific deterrence/rehabilitation: expected reduction in that offender’s post‑sanction risk from programming, supervision, and credible consequences.
- General deterrence: elasticity of the offense to certainty, swiftness, and severity; we exploit the dimensions that actually move behavior (certainty and celerity generally dominate severity).
- Collateral costs: criminogenic effects of imprisonment, family disruption, labor‑market scarring, fiscal costs, legitimacy penalties, and error costs.

We then set ranges that maximize expected net prevention under constraints of equal treatment and basic rights.

Two contrasts, worked through:

a) Provoked killing vs felony murder

- Provoked killing (adequate provocation; no prior violence; immediate surrender; remorse):
  Risk profile: typically low base‑rate for future lethal violence; event‑driven. Validated tools (e.g., OxRec; HCR‑20) usually flag such cases as lower risk once acute precipitants are removed.
  Prevention calculus: long incapacitation yields diminishing returns and higher criminogenic costs. General deterrent payoff of severity is weak in heat‑of‑passion contexts; certainty (clear charging and swift adjudication) matters more than additional years.
  Range: 4–8 years’ custody with front‑loaded, evidence‑based programming (emotion/self‑control, substance abuse if relevant), followed by 8–10 years of intensive supervision, firearms prohibitions, and victim‑safety conditions. Structured restorative options may safely substitute for custody at the low end when validated risk is very low and victims consent. This will be below Prof. Strauss’s bands because my target is future risk, not moral equivalence.

- Felony murder (armed robbery with loaded weapon; death of bystander; substantial planning; no purpose to kill):
  Risk profile: lifestyle criminality; willingness to take extreme risks for predatory gain; higher forward risk of violent reoffending absent change.
  Prevention calculus: incapacitation yields more averted harm here; general deterrence is also more responsive: clear weapon/lethal‑risk enhancements reliably shift behavior at the margin (e.g., fewer guns carried during robberies).
  Range: 10–16 years’ custody, with strong weapon‑use enhancements tied to actual risk imposition (brandishing a loaded firearm in public robberies, not merely felony labels), plus long‑term supervision. Where the lethal outcome was genuinely freakish given modest risk (e.g., unarmed co‑felon in a low‑risk burglary), the range drops (6–10 years). I agree with Strauss in rejecting strict liability; it’s the risk embraced, not the label, that matters. I tend to place high‑risk felony murders above provoked killings because the forward‑looking risk and marginal deterrence effects are greater.

b) Two rape scenarios

- Stranger rape with weapon and confinement:
  Harm is grave; but for prevention, the key is risk type. Predatory stranger rapists with planning and coercive control cues are the small group with markedly higher sexual and violent recidivism. For them:
  Range: 12–18 years’ custody with specialized treatment, followed by 10+ years of intensive supervision, exclusion zones, no‑contact orders, and tailored controls. The sanction is not ratcheted for “expressive fit” but for incapacitation and targeted general deterrence (weapon use enhancements). We also fund certainty: investments in forensic capability and victim‑support to raise reporting and clearance.

- Acquaintance assaults involving grooming and repetition:
  These patterns predict continued offending within networks, even if per‑incident physical injury is lower. The prevention lever is long‑horizon control of access and opportunity, plus behavior change.
  Range: similar or higher than the stranger case if dynamic risk is high (patterned predation): 10–16 years’ custody plus lengthy supervision and strict contact and digital‑communication controls; mandated treatment. Where validated risk is moderate and victims approve, part of the custodial term can be replaced with intensive, enforceable community‑based regimes that actually reduce reoffending (swift‑certain‑fair supervision; alcohol/drug controls where relevant). Severity beyond these bands buys little prevention; raising certainty and celerity buys more.

Dividing line with Prof. Strauss: I will not pay “moral debt” with extra years when the expected prevention yield is flat. I will, however, maintain a severity floor for high‑harm crimes to preserve the credibility of the norm (legitimacy), but the heavy lifting comes from certainty, swiftness, supervision, and tailored controls.

3) Measurement: from “seriousness” to prevention impact

I’m broadly supportive of Prof. Chen’s multidimensional indices as part of the front end, provided we add risk and cost. For a preventive regime, the relevant dimensions and their roles are:

- Harm severity and capability loss: not to justify pain, but to weight averted harm in the objective function and to prioritize investments in certainty (we are willing to spend more to prevent high‑harm offenses).
- Culpability elements (purpose, planning) as weak proxies for stable propensities and hence forward risk (careful to debias for socio‑economic confounds).
- Risk/needs factors (static and dynamic): strongest predictors of incapacitation benefit and responsivity to interventions.
- Uncertainty intervals: when the scale says “under‑determinate,” we default to narrower bands, require written reasons, and prefer reversible sanctions (community‑based controls) to minimize error costs.

I would operationalize this as a Prevention Impact Score for each sanction option:
PIS = expected averted harm (incapacitation + general deterrence + specific deterrence) – expected costs (fiscal + criminogenic + legitimacy + error),
estimated with Bayesian models and updated via audits and policy trials. We publish the weights and the audits. That is how we answer Bedau’s arbitrariness charge: by making the tradeoffs explicit, empirically estimated, and revisable.

4) Capital punishment

On present evidence, there is no credible marginal deterrent effect of executions over long prison terms once you control for certainty and swiftness; any small deterrence claims are swamped by error costs and legitimacy losses (including racially patterned disparities) that themselves impede crime control. Incapacitation adds nothing relative to LWOP. There is suggestive evidence of brutalization effects in some jurisdictions. The fiscal cost is higher. So the preventive case fails. My view is unambiguous: abolish.

5) Reply to Prof. Strauss’s challenge

A purely preventive theory can vindicate the asymmetry without desert by committing, ex ante and publicly, to legitimacy‑preserving rules—chief among them the categorical ban on intentionally harming the innocent and the correlating of hard treatment with proved wrongdoing. Those commitments are not window‑dressing; they are part of what makes prevention work in a free society. The “rare scapegoat” hypothetical ignores equilibrium effects and the knowledge problem. If you force me into a catastrophe trolley case where every equilibrium consideration is bracketed, of course my framework looks less satisfying—that’s because it is designed for actual institutional practice, not for thought experiments.

Two gentle challenges in return:

- Deontic “moral accounting” still has to pick numbers. Once you leave talion behind, your bands are ultimately anchored in socially negotiated weights and legitimacy, too. If we both must be transparent about those weights, we should prefer the regime that demonstrably reduces victimization per unit of coercion.

- On capital punishment, your procedural thresholds are so demanding that, in practice, your view converges with mine. If that is right, then we should design our institutions for the world we have: close capital pathways, invest in certainty and swiftness, and reserve the severest deprivations for those subpopulations where risk and marginal deterrence make them preventive rather than symbolic.

### Speaker: Host

Both Prof. Strauss and Dr. Holm lean on measurement to avoid Bedau’s charge of arbitrariness in R2, but in different ways. You’ve argued for multidimensional seriousness indices with uncertainty intervals. I’d like you to be concrete and rigorous here.

1) Model design. Specify a workable seriousness construct S with distinct components for (a) culpability (purpose/knowledge/recklessness/negligence; partial excuses; relational aggravators), (b) harm and risked harm (including autonomy loss, duration, multiplicity, credible-risk environments), and (c) abuse of trust or public office. How would you estimate weights (e.g., IRT/Bayesian hierarchical modeling)? What normative guardrails keep S from collapsing into mere harm (Sellin–Wolfgang’s problem) or into opaque judgment (Card’s Full Measure)?

2) Uncertainty and bands. Show how to produce 95% intervals around S and then map S to sentencing bands rather than points. What trigger rules would you recommend when intervals straddle band thresholds (e.g., default to the lower band; require written reasons; appellate review)?

3) Worked examples (numbers welcome). Using stylized but realistic inputs, compute S (with intervals) for the two pairs discussed:
   a) Provoked killing (adequate provocation; immediate surrender; no prior violence) vs. felony murder (loaded weapon in a planned robbery; bystander killed; clear foresight of lethal risk). 
   b) Sexual assault cases: (i) stranger rape with weapon, confinement, threats; (ii) acquaintance assault involving grooming, intoxication exploitation, repeated incidents. 
Make explicit how culpability and autonomy-loss components differ and how that affects S and bands.

4) Validation and democracy. Outline a validation pipeline: community surveys (including survivor samples), victim-impact research, recidivism forecasts, and cross‑jurisdictional calibration. How often should weights be re‑estimated? How do you prevent the scale from encoding racial/class bias (e.g., by excluding socio‑economic proxies and auditing disparate impact)?

5) Integration with preventive aims. Dr. Holm wants a Prevention Impact Score; Prof. Strauss seeks a moral‑equivalence ceiling. Can your S serve both—e.g., as a desert‑anchored upper bound and as an input to prevention calculus? If so, state the interface: S caps severity; risk/needs govern the point within the band. If not, say why.

Finally, address Bedau’s worry directly: why isn’t your banding still ultimately arbitrary? What features of transparency, empirical estimation, and periodic democratic revision make it the least arbitrary feasible scheme under non‑ideal conditions?

---

### Speaker: Prof. Wei-Lun Chen

Thanks, Chair. Let me put my cards on the table: R1 is nonnegotiable; R2 is indispensable but underdeterminate; R3 doesn’t carry justificatory water. My project is to turn the “fit” problem into a measured constraint with error bars that institutions can use responsibly.

1) Model design: a workable seriousness construct S

Structure. S is a latent construct composed of three separable pillars, each itself multidimensional:

- Culpability C (what the agent was responsible for choosing)
  - Mental state: purpose, knowledge, extreme recklessness, recklessness, negligence (ordered categories).
  - Quality of reasons: predation, cruelty, opportunism vs. panic, mixed motives.
  - Partial excuses: provocation (adequate), duress (non-exculpatory), severe but non-exculpatory impairment.
  - Reasons-responsiveness: planning, preparation; availability of lawful alternatives.
  - Exclusions: no strict liability; prior record is not part of C (that’s risk, not instant culpability).

- Harm and risked harm H,R (what was imposed on or credibly risked to others)
  - Realized harm H: death; serious injury; sexual/autonomy invasion; confinement; psychological trauma; duration; multiplicity; capability losses (work, family, mobility).
  - Risked harm R: ex ante lethal/serious-injury risk embraced (weapon brandishing, discharge); creation of credible-risk environments; endangerment to multiple persons; public-space risk externalities.
  - Feminist/ victimological content: autonomy-loss is not a proxy for medical injury; it includes terrorization, grooming, and long-term constraints on life plans.

- Relational aggravation T (abuse of normative position)
  - Abuse of trust or public office; fiduciary/caretaker roles; exploitation of dependency or vulnerability (functionally defined).

Estimation. We estimate S with a Bayesian hierarchical IRT framework:

- Items. Each of the above subcomponents is operationalized as polytomous items (graded-response models). Example: “mental state” is an ordered item; “provocation” is a partially crediting item that reduces C.
- Latent dimensions. We fit a multi-dimensional IRT where C, H, R, and T are separate latent traits. S is then a weighted linear composite of the four latent scores, re-scaled to a 0–100 index.
- Weights. We place weakly informative priors on the weights α = (αC, αH, αR, αT), with normative guardrails:
  - αC ∈ [0.35, 0.60] (culpability must matter at least as much as harm alone).
  - αH ∈ [0.30, 0.50].
  - αR ∈ [0.05, 0.25] (risked harm has independent, nontrivial weight).
  - αT ∈ [0.05, 0.15].
  - αC + αH + αR + αT = 1.
- Identification/anchors. We anchor the scale with a small set of paradigmatic offenses (e.g., aggravated stranger rape, armed robbery causing no injury, intentional homicide without torture) to fix the metric. We also enforce monotonicity constraints (worse item responses cannot lower the latent trait).

Data sources. To calibrate item difficulties/discriminations and weights:
- Deliberative community panels (probability samples plus survivor oversamples) doing pairwise/best–worst seriousness rankings on standardized vignettes.
- Victim-impact research (standardized instruments for autonomy/capability loss).
- Comparative sentencing panels (judges/prosecutors/defenders) to check face validity and to stress-test invariance.

Guardrails against the classic failures:
- Against Sellin–Wolfgang’s collapse into harm: culpability is its own latent dimension with a minimum weight floor; we measure risked harm separately from realized harm; and we forbid proxies for outcomes (e.g., medical bills) that smuggle socioeconomic status into H.
- Against Card’s opacity: item content, thresholds, discrimination parameters, and α-weights are published; code is open-source; and sensitivity analyses show how S moves if you vary α within the permitted priors.

2) Uncertainty and bands

Uncertainty. For each case, the model yields a posterior for each latent (C, H, R, T) and hence for S. We report the posterior mean Ŝ and a 95% credible interval [S5, S95].

Banding. We partition S into seriousness bands with published cutpoints tied to anchor offenses. Illustratively:
- Band 7: 85–100 (maximal non-capital)
- Band 6: 75–85
- Band 5: 65–75
- Band 4: 55–65
- Band 3: 45–55
- Band 2: 35–45
- Band 1: <35

Trigger rules when intervals straddle thresholds:
- Lenity default: if [S5, S95] spans two bands, start in the lower band.
- Reasoned elevation: an upward move into the higher band requires written reasons that identify specific, model-recognized factors or documented miscodings; automatic appellate review.
- Indeterminacy flag: if [S5, S95] spans more than two bands, treat as underdeterminate—convene a panel, prefer reversible sanctions, and narrow the decision with additional fact-finding if possible.

3) Worked examples (stylized numbers)

For concreteness, set αC=0.45, αH=0.35, αR=0.12, αT=0.08 (within guardrails). Component scores are on 0–10 scales; S rescaled to 0–100.

a) Provoked killing vs felony murder

- Provoked killing
  - C: purposeful killing (10) minus adequate provocation (−2) minus immediate surrender/remorse (−0.2 to −0.5): C ≈ 7.8 ± 0.6.
  - H: death: H ≈ 9.6 ± 0.3.
  - R: low ex ante risk creation beyond the act itself: R ≈ 2.0 ± 0.7.
  - T: none: T = 0.
  - Ŝ = 0.45*7.8 + 0.35*9.6 + 0.12*2.0 + 0.08*0 = 7.11 → 71.1 (± 3.0 SE → 95% ≈ [65.2, 77.0]).
  - Band: 5 by lenity (interval straddles 5/6).

- Felony murder (planned armed robbery; loaded weapon; clear foresight of lethal risk; bystander killed)
  - C: extreme recklessness re: life, predatory plan: C ≈ 6.8 ± 0.7 (no intent to kill).
  - H: death: H ≈ 9.6 ± 0.3.
  - R: high ex ante lethal risk embraced (public gunpoint robbery with loaded firearm): R ≈ 8.5 ± 0.6.
  - T: none: T = 0.
  - Ŝ = 0.45*6.8 + 0.35*9.6 + 0.12*8.5 = 7.44 → 74.4 (± 3.4 SE → 95% ≈ [67.8, 81.0]).
  - Band: 5 by lenity (interval straddles 5/6), with transparent reason to sit toward the top of Band 5 or to depart upward with reasons: the R component is doing work that a pure harm scale misses.

Observation. The ex ante risk embraced pushes felony murder above provoked killing even though both have H=death, because we refuse to collapse seriousness into realized harm.

b) Sexual assault: stranger armed rape vs acquaintance grooming/repetition

- Stranger rape with weapon, confinement, threats
  - C: purposeful sexual violation with planning: C ≈ 8.5 ± 0.6.
  - H: autonomy deprivation severe; confinement; credible ongoing risk; trauma: H ≈ 8.8 ± 0.6.
  - R: high ex ante risk (weapon, threats): R ≈ 7.5 ± 0.6.
  - T: none: T = 0.
  - Ŝ = 0.45*8.5 + 0.35*8.8 + 0.12*7.5 = 7.81 → 78.1 (± 3.5 SE → 95% ≈ [71.2, 84.9]).
  - Band: 6 (interval may just nick Band 5; reasons can resolve).

- Acquaintance assault with grooming, intoxication exploitation, repeated incidents
  - C: purposeful violation; grooming; repetition: C ≈ 8.5 ± 0.6.
  - H: per-incident physical injury lower but autonomy loss amplified by repetition and social entanglement; enduring capability loss: H ≈ 8.2 ± 0.6 (with repetition modifier).
  - R: moderate ex ante risk to physical integrity; high risk of continuing victimization within network: R ≈ 6.0 ± 0.7.
  - T: abuse of trust/vulnerability: T ≈ 2.0 ± 0.5 (on a 0–3 scale).
  - Ŝ = 0.45*8.5 + 0.35*8.2 + 0.12*6.0 + 0.08*2.0 = 7.58 → 75.8 (± 3.6 SE → 95% ≈ [68.8, 82.7]).
  - Band: 6 or high 5; repeated domination and relational abuse can place this as serious as, or more serious than, a one-off stranger case—capturing Prof. O’Rourke’s concern.

Mapping bands to dispositional ranges (illustrative, not prescriptive):
- Band 7: 15–25 years (max non-capital)
- Band 6: 10–15 years
- Band 5: 7–12 years
- Band 4: 3–8 years
Ranges are ceilings for retributive proportionality; within-band placement is governed by prevention (see 5).

4) Validation and democracy

Pipeline.
- Elicitation. Biennial community seriousness surveys with stratified random sampling; oversample survivors and marginalized communities; tasks: paired comparisons, best–worst scaling, and vignette rating.
- Victim-impact science. Longitudinal studies of autonomy and capability losses after different crimes; integrate as H indicators.
- Judicial calibration. Periodic structured elicitation from judges and practitioners to identify divergences between S and reflective practice.
- Cross-jurisdictional calibration. Multi-state pooling with hierarchical priors; allow local random effects while keeping national anchors.

Re-estimation cadence.
- Annual incremental updates (Bayesian updating on new data).
- 5-year major re-estimation and public hearing cycle; sunset clause on weights unless reauthorized.

Bias prevention.
- Exclude protected-class proxies from S (race, neighborhood, income, immigration status). S is about the instant offense, not the person’s social location.
- Define “vulnerability” functionally (custodial dependence, disability) and apply symmetrically to avoid valuing some victims’ harms less.
- Differential item functioning (DIF) tests across groups; drop or adjust items that behave differently without principled reason.
- Disparate impact audits: simulate sentencing under S; publish group-level effects; require justification and revision if disparities appear that cannot be normatively defended.

Governance.
- Independent Sentencing Metrics Commission with members drawn from survivors, formerly incarcerated persons, line defenders/prosecutors, judges, statisticians, and ethicists.
- Open data and code; redaction protocols to protect privacy.
- Notice-and-comment for any change to α-guardrails or band cutpoints; legislative ratification for major shifts.

5) Integration with preventive aims (Strauss ceiling; Holm PIS)

Yes—S can serve both.

- Step 1 (Desert cap/floor). Compute S and its band with intervals. That band is the permissible severity window as a matter of proportionality (upper bound; you may also set a desert floor for norm-signaling).
- Step 2 (Prevention choice). For options within the band, compute Dr. Holm’s Prevention Impact Score:
  PIS(option) = E[averted harm via incapacitation + general deterrence + specific deterrence] − E[costs: criminogenic, fiscal, legitimacy, error].
  Choose the option maximizing PIS subject to dignity constraints (no degrading penalties) and the S ceiling.
- Step 3 (Reason-giving and review). Document which factors drove S and PIS; require appellate review for out-of-band moves or when uncertainty flags fire.

This interface preserves Prof. Strauss’s side-constraint role for desert, while enabling Dr. Holm’s forward-looking optimization inside the constraint set.

Why this isn’t “still arbitrary” (answering Bedau)

Three reasons.

- Structural transparency and constraint. We do not hide value choices: α-weights, item content, cutpoints, and code are public; α has guardrails that entrench the independent role of culpability and risked harm. Dignity constraints forbid certain penalty types regardless of S.

- Quantified uncertainty and lenity. We never pretend to precision we don’t have. Intervals are reported; when underdetermination is material, we default to the lower band, require reasons to go higher, prefer reversible sanctions, and flag cases for appellate scrutiny.

- Democratic revisability with audit. The scale is not a technocrat’s oracle; it is a measured instantiation of community judgments and victim research, subject to regular re-elicitation, bias audits, and legislative oversight. That institutionalizes contestation, which is the only honest cure for indeterminacy in a diverse polity.

Two friendly challenges back to colleagues:

- Miriam, once you publish your “moral equivalence” weights and bands, you will face the same underdetermination. My proposal is simply to own it statistically and govern it institutionally.

- Leif, if prevention alone sets severity, the temptation will always be to sneak priors about desert into “legitimacy costs.” Using S explicitly as a ceiling/floor keeps that accounting candid and democratically supervised.

Bottom line. We cannot abolish judgment from proportionality; we can domesticate it. A multidimensional, audited, and revisable S with uncertainty bands gives us the least-arbitrary feasible map from wrongs to permissible punishment under non-ideal conditions. It avoids Sellin–Wolfgang’s harm collapse, Card’s opacity, and von Hirsch’s point estimates—and it gives Judge Villanueva exactly what she asked for: structured discretion with reasons and review.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Villanueva, you’ve asked for structured discretion with reasons and review. You’ve now heard Prof. Chen propose a multidimensional seriousness index S with uncertainty bands and lenity triggers, and Dr. Holm propose a Prevention Impact Score (PIS) to choose within-band sanctions. From a guideline designer’s perspective, please get concrete about institutionalization:

1) Guideline architecture. How would you translate S-bands into a workable grid? Specify: (a) default ranges per band; (b) departure rules when the 95% interval straddles thresholds; (c) the standard of proof and trier for S-affecting facts (e.g., autonomy-loss magnitude, risked harm)—jury beyond a reasonable doubt, or judge by clear and convincing? 

2) Reason-giving and review. Draft the core elements you would require in a sentencing statement that uses S and PIS (e.g., identify the items driving C, H, R, T; disclose the credible interval; explain any upward move despite lenity; articulate the PIS tradeoff). What should be the appellate standard of review for (i) S computation; (ii) band selection; (iii) within-band choice?

3) Integrating reparative options. Prof. Strauss treats reparative duties as potentially punitive when imposed as censure-backed, non-optional burdens; Prof. Qureshi would go further and see repair as presumptive. Within your mixed theory, where and how would you authorize validated restorative dispositions within a band without violating equal-treatment expectations? What screening (victim consent? risk tools?) and what backstops (swift consequences for noncompliance) would you build in?

4) Managing bias and background injustice. Dr. Baptiste will press the Murphy critique: any proportionality scheme risks laundering structural inequality. What concrete auditing and remedial tools would you write into the guidelines to detect and correct disparate impact (e.g., periodic bias reports, automatic variance for poverty-driven offenses, forbidding certain proxies)? Who has standing to challenge the metric or its application on equality grounds, and what remedies are available (remand vs. systemic revision)?

5) Due process and democracy. Should S’s component findings (e.g., abuse of trust, relational vulnerability, autonomy-loss severity) be elements of the offense (jury), sentencing factors (judge), or some hybrid? If hybrid, draw the line and justify it. Would you require periodic public hearings and legislative ratification for changes to S weights and cutpoints, as Prof. Chen suggests?

6) Worked example. Please walk through a sample sentencing statement using S and PIS for the felony-murder scenario (armed robbery with loaded weapon; bystander killed; strong foresight of lethal risk; no intent to kill), showing: (i) S inputs and interval; (ii) band selection under the lenity rule; (iii) within-band choice based on PIS (incapacitation benefit, general deterrence from weapon-use enhancements, criminogenic costs), and (iv) any restorative conditions you would add.

7) Capital punishment. Given your mixed view—desert as side-constraint; harm reduction as justification—do Chen’s uncertainty intervals and Holm’s error-costs/legitimacy analysis push you toward a practical moratorium on capital charging? If not, what charging and review structure would be necessary to pass your error-cost and non-arbitrariness tests (e.g., centralized charging, heightened proof standards, residual doubt review)?

Finally, be candid about tradeoffs: where does institutional administrability force you to simplify Chen’s model, and what safeguards would you put in to keep simplifications from sliding back into Bedau’s arbitrariness?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Elena P. Villanueva

Thank you, Chair. I’ll be concrete and, where necessary, blunt about tradeoffs.

1) Guideline architecture

- Grid design tied to S-bands
  - Map Prof. Chen’s S to seven seriousness bands. For administrability, each band has a narrow default range, plus a “supervision tail” and standard collateral orders.
    - Band 7 (85–100): 15–25 years custody; 10–15 years supervision.
    - Band 6 (75–85): 10–15 years custody; 8–12 years supervision.
    - Band 5 (65–75): 7–12 years custody; 5–10 years supervision.
    - Band 4 (55–65): 3–8 years custody; 3–7 years supervision.
    - Lower bands scale accordingly.
  - Within each band, the Commission publishes approved “modality menus” (custody; split custody; intensive community sanctions packages) so judges choose among equivalent options, not invent them ad hoc.

- Departure rules when the 95% interval straddles thresholds
  - Lenity default: if the credible interval crosses a band line, start in the lower band.
  - Upward move despite lenity requires: (a) identification of the specific, model‑recognized facts that would resolve the uncertainty upward; (b) clear and convincing proof of those facts; (c) written reasons; and (d) automatic appellate review.
  - If the interval spans more than two bands, treat as underdeterminate: convene a three‑judge sentencing panel or remand for further fact-finding; prefer reversible sanctions (community‑based controls) until the record is developed.

- Trier and standard of proof for S‑affecting facts
  - Hybrid consistent with due process and Apprendi/Blakely principles:
    - Any fact that increases the legally authorized ceiling (i.e., would permit sentencing in a higher S‑band than the offense of conviction otherwise authorizes) must be charged or admitted, and found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
    - Facts that affect placement within the authorized band (e.g., degree of autonomy loss; risk embraced; abuse of trust when it does not raise the statutory maximum) are sentencing factors found by the judge under a clear and convincing standard.
  - To minimize Apprendi friction, the Commission should align major offense degrees with band ceilings, so that most S‑component findings operate within-band.

2) Reason‑giving and review

- Required contents of the sentencing statement
  1) Offense of conviction; applicable statutory maximum and the corresponding authorized S‑band.
  2) The computed S, its components (C, H, R, T), and the 95% credible interval; attach the worksheet showing the item codings used.
  3) Band selection: if lenity controlled, say so. If moving upward across a threshold, identify the specific facts, the evidence standard met, and why the lenity default is overcome.
  4) Prevention analysis (PIS): summarize expected incapacitation benefit, general deterrence considerations (e.g., weapon‑use enhancements with empirical support), specific deterrence/rehabilitation prospects, and collateral costs (criminogenic, fiscal, legitimacy). Explain why the chosen modality and duration maximize prevention within the S‑band and respect dignity constraints.
  5) Reparative conditions (if any): identify which are punitive (censure‑backed, non‑optional) and which are restorative, the victim’s position, and the monitoring/enforcement plan.
  6) Equality/bias checks: certify that no forbidden proxies were used; note any applicable structural mitigators and why.

- Appellate standards of review
  - S computation: legal questions de novo; item codings for which there is evidentiary dispute under clear error; adherence to lenity and trigger rules de novo.
  - Band selection: if within the authorized band, abuse of discretion bounded by the grid; if crossing a band threshold upward, “heightened reasonableness” with independent review of whether the evidentiary standard was met and reasons were adequate.
  - Within‑band choice: abuse of discretion, but the court must engage the PIS tradeoff; silence on prevention is reversible.

3) Integrating reparative options

- Authorization within bands
  - Within any band, the Commission authorizes “validated restorative packages” that are punitive when imposed as censure‑backed, non‑optional obligations (reparations funds, victim‑approved conferencing, community labor linked to harm, mandated treatment, letters of acknowledgment).
  - Equivalency schedule: publish conversion guidelines (e.g., X hours of verified, skilled community work or a structured restitution plan with wage‑garnish plus participation in a mediated process equals Y months of custody), based on evidence of compliance and prevention value—so equal‑treatment expectations are preserved.

- Screening and safeguards
  - Victim consent is required for direct encounters; victims may opt for indirect repair only.
  - Risk screening with validated tools; disqualify high‑risk violent offenders from fully community‑based packages unless additional controls render risk acceptable (electronic monitoring, exclusion zones).
  - Swift‑certain‑fair backstops: graduated, prompt sanctions for noncompliance; clear revocation routes back to custody; a single judge maintains jurisdiction to ensure continuity.

4) Managing bias and background injustice

- Auditing and remedial tools
  - Quarterly disparate‑impact dashboards (race, ethnicity, gender, indigence), published by offense type, S‑band, and modality.
  - Forbid proxies in S and PIS: race, ZIP code, education, employment status, and other socio‑economic markers cannot be used directly or as “risk” stand‑ins.
  - Structural mitigator: a narrowly defined “economic duress” mitigator available where credible evidence shows the offense was substantially motivated by acute material need rather than predation, never applicable to high‑harm violence; reduces C by one step with clear and convincing proof.
  - Automatic equity variance: when dashboards show a statistically significant unexplained disparity within an offense category/band persisting for two consecutive quarters, trigger Commission review; authorize judges to apply a temporary downward variance presumption for the over‑impacted group pending corrective revision of the metric or practices.

- Standing and remedies
  - Standing: defendants; state public defender; attorney general; designated civil rights organizations; victim advocates (for disparate minimization of high‑harm treatment).
  - Remedies: case‑specific remand for resentencing; injunctive relief requiring Commission to adjust items/weights; moratoria on use of particular factors; systemic revision with deadlines; independent monitor where necessary.

5) Due process and democracy

- Elements vs sentencing factors (hybrid)
  - Elements (jury BRD): facts that raise the statutory maximum/band ceiling—e.g., “abuse of public office” if it authorizes Band 7; “use of a loaded firearm in public robbery” if it authorizes entry into a higher band.
  - Sentencing factors (judge C&C): gradations of autonomy loss, risk embraced within the offense definition, relational vulnerability when it does not alter the statutory maximum, genuine remorse/assistance, provocation adequacy (if the legislature has created a partial‑excuse sentencing factor).
  - Justification: preserves the jury’s constitutional role over exposure while allowing judges to do principled within‑band calibration with a higher‑than‑preponderance standard.

- Democratic governance
  - Yes: periodic public hearings and legislative ratification for any change to α‑weights, band cutpoints, or dignity constraints every five years (with interim updates via notice‑and‑comment). Publish data and code. Require a supermajority of the Commission to alter guardrails that protect the independent role of culpability and risked harm.

6) Worked example: felony murder (planned armed robbery; loaded weapon; bystander killed; strong foresight; no intent to kill)

- S inputs (using Chen‑style scoring)
  - C: extreme recklessness regarding human life in service of predatory ends; planning; no intent to kill; no mitigation. C = 6.8 (95% CI 6.0–7.5).
  - H: death. H = 9.6 (9.0–10.0).
  - R: high ex ante lethal risk embraced in a public space with a loaded firearm; multiple persons exposed. R = 8.5 (7.8–9.1).
  - T: no abuse of trust. T = 0.
  - With αC=0.45, αH=0.35, αR=0.12, αT=0.08, Ŝ ≈ 74.4 with 95% CI ≈ [67.8, 81.0].

- Band selection
  - The interval straddles the 75 cutpoint between Bands 5 and 6. Under lenity, Band 5 applies (7–12 years’ custody; 5–10 years’ supervision). The State seeks Band 6; I deny because the upward facts (risk embraced) are already captured in R and do not, on this record, meet the clear and convincing standard to overcome lenity.

- Within‑band choice (PIS)
  - Incapacitation benefit: actuarial indicators (prior weapon carrying, lifestyle criminality) suggest elevated forward risk; incapacitation yields nontrivial averted harm during custody.
  - General deterrence: weapon‑use enhancements in public robberies have documented marginal deterrent effects (fewer guns carried when the certainty of enhancement is high). Severity beyond the top of Band 5 shows diminishing returns compared to investments in certainty/celerity.
  - Specific deterrence/rehabilitation: credible programming available (CBT, vocational training); post‑release controls (long supervision; exclusion zones; firearm prohibitions).
  - Collateral costs: long custodial terms carry criminogenic and fiscal costs; legitimacy costs are moderated by transparency and avoidance of strict liability.
  - Choice: 11 years’ custody (top of Band 5), plus 8 years’ intensive supervision with zero‑tolerance firearm conditions; mandatory violent‑offender programming; exclusion zones around the robbery corridor; no‑contact orders with co‑offenders; and compliance monitoring.

- Reparative conditions
  - Punitive‑reparative: 10% of prison wages and 10% of post‑release earnings for five years paid into a victim compensation fund designated by the decedent’s family (censure‑backed, non‑optional); a non‑contact acknowledgment letter subject to the family’s wishes; participation in a mediated impact panel if and only if the family consents. Swift‑certain‑fair consequences for noncompliance.

- Sentencing statement (sketch)
  - I would include the S components and interval, the lenity application, the PIS rationale (why 11/8 is the prevention‑maximizing point within the band), and an explicit acknowledgment that the absence of intent to kill places this case in Band 5 rather than 6 under our rules.

7) Capital punishment

Given our mixed framework, Prof. Chen’s quantified uncertainty and Dr. Holm’s error‑cost/legitimacy analysis leave me no responsible space for capital charging in practice. The error rate is not vanishingly low; disparities persist; delay and death‑row conditions raise dignity concerns. I would recommend a practical moratorium.

If a jurisdiction insists on retaining it, the minimum structure would be:
- Centralized statewide charging authority; racially blind charging screens; a requirement of at least two independent incriminating evidence streams (e.g., DNA or equivalent plus corroborated confession or reliable eyewitness).
- Heightened proof: beyond a reasonable doubt plus a “residual doubt” safety valve permitting juries to choose LWOP where any non‑trivial doubt remains.
- Automatic proportionality review; “comparative deserts” analysis statewide; uniform protocols to eliminate county‑level variance.
- Open‑file discovery; recorded interrogations; exclusion of uncorroborated jailhouse informants; validated forensics only.
- Time‑bound appellate review to avoid decades‑long limbo.

I remain skeptical that these conditions can be durably met; absent that, abolition is the candid course.

Tradeoffs and safeguards

- Simplifying Chen’s model
  - We cannot run a bespoke Bayesian model in every courtroom. The Commission should pre‑compute and publish a validated scoring instrument (structured worksheets and a digital tool) that implements the model with a limited, high‑signal set of items; freeze α‑weights for a five‑year cycle; and provide on‑bench guidance tables with pre‑calculated credible intervals for common fact patterns.
  - To avoid sliding back into arbitrariness:
    - Keep bands narrow; require written reasons for any upward movement across a threshold.
    - Mandate disclosure of the S worksheet in every case; prohibit “free‑text” aggravation not mapped to recognized items.
    - Institutionalize appellate policing of reasons; publish reversal rates by judge and county.
    - Require annual bias audits and public hearings; sunset the instrument unless reauthorized after review of accuracy, equity, and usability.
    - Train judges and counsel; certify risk‑assessment vendors; prohibit use of black‑box tools.

Two closing challenges to my colleagues

- To Prof. Strauss: your moral‑equivalence ceiling and my S‑bands converge operationally. The hard question is not whether to cap, but how to write caps so that line judges can apply them without reconstructing Kant on a Tuesday afternoon. Publishing weights, bands, and reasons is the price of legitimacy.

- To Dr. Holm: prevention does the heavy lifting within bands, but I will not allow “legitimacy costs” to become a back‑door desert proxy. Keeping S as a public ceiling/floor is how we keep our forward‑looking calculus from drifting into expediency.

The aim is Bedau’s: mitigate arbitrariness. The tools are structured discretion, narrow bands, written reasons, and review—with humility about what we don’t know, and institutions that can correct course.

---

### Speaker: Host

Prof. Qureshi, Bedau’s A1 treats punishment as necessarily hard treatment (harm/suffering), and he worries that once we abandon talion, proportionality drifts. You reject A1 and R3, reframing desert as a claim to answer and repair. I’d like you to make that vision operational and to confront the hardest cases.

1) Conceptual core. If punishment need not be suffering, what makes a reparative disposition genuinely punitive rather than civil? Give necessary and sufficient features (e.g., authoritative censure, non‑optional duties, linkage to the wrong, communicative rituals), and say whether you accept A2 as the gatekeeper. Where, if anywhere, is hard treatment required for grave wrongs, or can repair plus censure fully discharge the state’s response?

2) Proportionality of obligations. Sketch your metric for “proportional repair”: what are the obligation dimensions (material restitution; time‑bound service; apology/acknowledgment; reintegration conditions; community benefit)? How do you calibrate weightings to autonomy loss and culpability without collapsing into Card’s opacity or von Hirsch’s arbitrariness? Could your metric be stated with the same transparency/uncertainty discipline Prof. Chen used for S (e.g., published weights; credible intervals; lenity triggers)?

3) Worked examples (same as others):
  a) Provoked killing (adequate provocation; immediate surrender; no prior violence) vs. felony murder (planned armed robbery with loaded weapon; bystander killed; clear foresight of lethal risk). What are the core reparative duties in each? What custodial, if any, remains once repair is undertaken? 
  b) Sexual assault: (i) stranger rape with weapon, confinement, terror; (ii) acquaintance assaults involving grooming and repetition. Specify obligations to the victim (if they consent), to the community, and to survivor services. If a victim declines engagement, what substitutes preserve accountability without re‑traumatization?

4) Integration with S and PIS. Judge Villanueva authorized “validated restorative packages” within bands, and Dr. Holm wants prevention to drive within‑band choices. Do you:
  - Treat reparative packages as presumptive within any band where validated risk is not high? 
  - Use Chen’s S as a ceiling and your obligations metric as the primary within‑band selector? 
  - Or do you propose a parallel track that can substitute for custody even in higher bands where repair is robust and risk is controllable? Please be explicit about screening (victim consent; risk tools), equivalency schedules (what counts as the punitive equivalent of Y months’ custody), and backstops for noncompliance.

5) Equality and net‑widening. Dr. Baptiste will warn that restorative options often favor the resourced and net‑widen the system. What design features prevent that (e.g., sliding‑scale restitution, guaranteed access to mediation/facilitators, exclusion of wealth‑based conditions, audits of disparate uptake)? Who gets to opt in, and how do you stop prosecutors from over‑charging to extract “repair bargains”?

6) Evidence. Point us to the best data on victim satisfaction, recidivism, and community safety from victim–offender mediation and conferencing in serious‑violence contexts. Where are the boundary conditions? What failures should make us revert to incapacitation?

7) Engage the critics. 
  - Respond to Prof. Strauss’s claim that for grave wrongs “some hard‑treatment component remains required to register the gravity of the past choice.” Can censure plus robust obligations suffice without custodial pain? 
  - Address Dr. Holm’s legitimacy concern: if reparative outcomes vary case‑by‑case with victim preferences, how do you preserve equal treatment and general deterrence signals? 
  - And to Judge Villanueva: how would your model fit the due‑process divisions she drew (what facts must a jury find; what counts as a punitive obligation that raises the penalty ceiling)?

---

### Speaker: Prof. Saira Qureshi

Thank you, Chair. Let me make the reparative alternative fully operational and meet the hard cases head‑on.

1) Conceptual core: when repair is punishment

- Gatekeeper. I accept A2: penal liability attaches only upon proof of culpable offense.

- Necessary and sufficient features of punitive reparation
  1) Authoritative censure: a formal, public statement that the wrong was committed and condemned, addressed to the offender as answerable.
  2) Non‑optional duties: enforceable obligations imposed by the court; breach triggers swift, proportionate consequences.
  3) Linkage: duties are substantively tied to the specific wrong (its harms, risks, relationships).
  4) Dialogic accountability: structured opportunities to acknowledge, explain, apologize, and listen (directly only with victim consent; otherwise via surrogate/community).
  5) Status work: a defined pathway to reintegration upon completion.

If those features are present, the disposition is penal, not merely civil—even if the primary currency is repair rather than suffering.

- Is hard treatment ever required? Only instrumentally: where risk cannot be responsibly managed in the community or where liberty restrictions are needed to enable safe and credible accountability. Custody is not ruled out, but its point is safety and the conditions for repair—not pain as payback.

2) Proportionality of obligations: a transparent metric

I propose an Obligations Index, O, calibrated to culpability and autonomy loss, with published weights and uncertainty intervals (mirroring Prof. Chen’s discipline).

Dimensions (scored on standardized scales; all duties time‑bound; sliding‑scale for ability to pay)
- Financial redress F: restitution to victims where apt; else payments to survivor services funds; assessed as a share of income to avoid wealth bias.
- Service S: verified, skilled community service linked to the harm (e.g., violence‑interruption, trauma‑support logistics).
- Accountability A: number and depth of facilitated sessions; written acknowledgment; where appropriate, a narrative accepted by the forum as owning the wrong.
- Liberty limits L: curfews, exclusion zones, electronic monitoring, reporting frequency—calibrated to risk and to prevent further harm.
- Change plan B: completion of evidence‑based programs (e.g., violence, sexual behavior, substance use), with relapse‑responsive supports.
- Reintegration R: education/work milestones; relational reparation to impacted communities.

Weights. Publish αF, αS, αA, αL, αB, αR; set guardrails so no single dimension dominates. Tie the O target to an offense‑seriousness profile derived from C (culpability) and A* (autonomy/capability loss), each estimated as separate latent traits with credible intervals. Lenity and written‑reasons rules apply when uncertainty straddles thresholds. Convert O into “burden points” with a public equivalency schedule (e.g., one month of custody equals X burden points = Y hours of service + Z% income share + defined liberty limits); the schedule is a bridge for mixed regimes, not the moral basis of the disposition.

3) Worked examples

a) Provoked killing vs felony murder

- Provoked killing (adequate provocation; immediate surrender; no prior violence; low forward risk)
  Core duties:
  - F: income‑based payments into a dependents’ support/memorial fund over 8–10 years.
  - S: 800–1,200 hours of service in violence prevention or victim‑support logistics across 3–5 years.
  - A: formal apology; 6–10 facilitated sessions if the family consents, otherwise community panel acknowledgment.
  - L: curfew, exclusion zones, reporting; firearm prohibition; 5–8 years.
  - B: targeted self‑regulation/emotion programming; grief/trauma counseling.
  - R: vocational/education completion.
  Custody: not presumptively required if validated risk is low and duties are secured; initial residential programming may substitute for a short custodial term where structure is needed.

- Felony murder (planned armed robbery; loaded weapon; clear foresight of lethal risk; bystander killed; elevated forward risk)
  Core duties:
  - F: income‑based payments to a homicide survivor fund and a gun‑violence prevention fund; longer horizon (10–12 years).
  - S: 1,200–1,800 hours in violence‑interruption/gun‑risk education under tight supervision.
  - A: acknowledgment and community forum; victim‑family options as above.
  - L: stringent liberty controls (curfew, GPS, exclusion of high‑risk zones) for 8–12 years.
  - B: intensive cognitive‑behavioral and employment programs.
  Custody: front‑loaded incapacitation is often warranted to manage risk and create space for change; but it should be the minimum necessary, with a clear conversion path to community‑based obligations once risk is demonstrably down.

b) Sexual assault

- Stranger rape (weapon; confinement; terror)
  Core duties:
  - F: payments to survivor services; victim‑directed restitution only if the survivor asks.
  - S: 1,200–1,800 hours in supervised roles not involving access to vulnerable persons; multi‑year horizon.
  - A: only with survivor consent; otherwise surrogate panels. Non‑contact acknowledgment is mandatory.
  - L: robust controls—GPS, exclusion zones, chaperone requirements in public venues, long supervision.
  - B: long‑term, evidence‑based sexual behavior treatment with external clinical audit.
  Custody: likely necessary initially for safety with high‑risk profiles; replaced by secure, therapeutic residential programs where available; the aim is to move to intensive, enforceable community controls as soon as risk allows.

- Acquaintance assaults (grooming; repetition)
  Core duties:
  - F: survivor‑services funding; if survivor consents, tailored restitution.
  - S: substantial service and prevention work focused on consent and power dynamics.
  - A: structured acknowledgment; no contact orders; if the survivor declines engagement, accountability is to a community panel.
  - L: strict relational boundaries, social‑media restrictions, exclusion from spaces with targets of prior grooming; long supervision.
  - B: specialized treatment; bystander‑intervention work as part of service.
  Custody: contingent on validated risk; many such cases can be managed with rigorous community regimes if controls and monitoring are tight.

If a victim declines any engagement, all accountability runs through community forums and written acknowledgment; the burdens remain—form varies, not magnitude.

4) How this integrates with S and PIS

- Presumption. Within any S‑band where validated risk is low or moderate, reparative packages are the default. In higher bands, they are authorized to substitute for some or all custody if O duties reach the band‑appropriate burden points and risk is controllable with L.

- Interface. Use Chen’s S as ceiling/floor for severity; set O targets by band; pick the within‑band mix by prevention (Holm’s PIS). Publish an equivalency table: e.g., Band 5 requires 1,200–1,800 burden points; a package might be 900 hours service + 10% income share for 5 years + curfew/GPS for 4 years + treatment benchmarks.

- Screening and backstops. Victim consent governs direct encounters; validated risk tools gate community placement; noncompliance triggers swift, proportionate sanctions, including conversion of unserved burden points to custody.

5) Equality and net‑widening safeguards

- Eligibility. Limit to cases otherwise facing custody; no adding RJ on top of minor sanctions.

- Access. Independent, publicly funded facilitators; defense and community referrals allowed; prosecutors cannot monopolize the gateway.

- Affordability. Income‑based payments with caps; service hours adjusted for caregiving and disability; never substitute cash for service.

- Over‑charging checks. “No‑worse‑off” rule: opting into repair cannot expose the defendant to a harsher custodial fallback than the standard guideline.

- Audits. Quarterly uptake and outcome audits by race, class, and neighborhood; corrective action if disparities persist without justification.

6) Evidence and boundary conditions

- Victims. RCTs and quasi‑experiments (e.g., UK Justice Research Consortium; Canberra RISE) show markedly higher victim satisfaction and reduced PTSD symptoms after conferencing compared to court; serious‑violence victim–offender dialogues conducted post‑conviction show strong mental‑health gains.

- Recidivism. For violent offenses, several trials found reductions relative to court processing; effects are program‑ and context‑dependent. Adult sexual violence evidence is thinner; what we have supports risk‑responsive treatment plus strict controls, with any dialogic element contingent on survivor consent.

- Boundary conditions for reverting to incapacitation. High, persistent risk despite compliant engagement; repeated breaches of core safety conditions; credible evidence of ongoing coercive control; refusal of all accountability duties. Incapacitation is then justified as a safety measure, not as a quantum of pain.

7) Engaging the criticisms

- To Prof. Strauss: registering gravity does not require calibrated suffering. It requires calibrated accountability. A multi‑year, life‑reordering set of obligations—public censure, sustained service tied to the wrong, income redirection, tight liberty limits, and face‑to‑face answerability where the survivor invites it—can communicate condemnation and restore normative equilibrium more truthfully than warehousing. Pain may occur as a by‑product; it is not the point.

- To Dr. Holm: equal treatment and deterrence are preserved by standardization. The O targets are set by S‑bands, not by victim preference. Victims may shape the form (direct vs surrogate), not the burden. Deterrence flows from certainty of censure and durable consequences, not from ever‑longer custody. We should invest in raising the certainty of reparative accountability.

- To Judge Villanueva: due process fits cleanly.
  - Elements for jury beyond a reasonable doubt: facts that authorize higher S‑band ceilings (e.g., weapon use; abuse of trust) and any aggravator that would permit higher O targets than the offense of conviction otherwise allows.
  - Sentencing factors for judge by clear and convincing: the specific composition of O within the ceiling (hours, payment shares, liberty‑limit intensity), validated risk level, victim consent to direct encounters.
  - Any increase above the default O target for the band requires written reasons and automatic review; victim refusal cannot raise the burden.

A final note. Bedau’s worry about drift once talion is gone is real. The way to avoid it is not to relapse into a proportionality of pain, but to discipline a proportionality of obligations: publish the weights and conversion rules, report uncertainty, default to lenity, and allow democratic revision. Where repair can deliver censure, safety, and restoration, carceral hard‑treatment is presumptively unjust. Where it cannot, we incapacitate to the minimum necessary—and still bind that deprivation to dialogic accountability rather than to suffering as an end.

### Speaker: Host

Dr. Baptiste, Bedau channels Murphy’s critique that “unfair‑advantage” justifications presuppose a just background order and so cannot legitimate punishment under non‑ideal conditions. We’ve now heard an elaborate technocratic answer to arbitrariness (Chen’s S with guardrails; Villanueva’s structured discretion; Holm’s PIS) and two normative anchors (Strauss’s deontic ceiling; Qureshi’s reparative substitution). I want you to press the structural question and then get concrete.

1) Structural diagnosis. Do S‑bands, PIS, and guideline grids merely launder classed and racialized domination under a veneer of proportionality? Identify specific points where bias enters despite Chen’s exclusions: e.g., item content (autonomy‑loss valuations), offense definitions (property vs wage‑theft asymmetries), policing inputs (weapon use, public‑space risk), and “legitimacy costs” that may smuggle desert back in. Give us a couple of case comparisons where the same social harm distributes differently across race/class (drug markets; survival theft; tax and environmental crimes) and show how the proposed schemes would still misfire.

2) Replacement architecture. If R3 collapses under injustice and R2’s calibration is structurally tainted, what is the alternative justificatory frame? Sketch your preferred minimal penal footprint: which harms (if any) remain within penal sanction, and why? Do you retain A2/R1 as liability gates or move to non‑penal regulation entirely (fines, licenses, civil protection, administrative incapacitation)? Be explicit about the normative principle (e.g., anti‑domination, public health, capabilities) that does the justificatory work.

3) High‑harm violence. For intimate‑partner and sexual violence—the hardest cases—what does a decarceral but safety‑first regime look like in practice? Specify the mix: protective orders, electronic/geofencing controls, income supports and housing for survivors, specialized prevention and treatment, and when (if ever) you still authorize custodial incapacitation. How do you avoid reproducing patriarchal/racial harms through surveillance tools?

4) Restorative justice under non‑ideal conditions. Qureshi proposes “obligations of repair” as presumptive. You’ve warned elsewhere about net‑widening and access bias. What design features are non‑negotiable to prevent RJ becoming a status weapon (e.g., sliding‑scale monetary duties; independent gateways; banning over‑charging to extract repair; community governance)? Where do you draw a hard line that triggers incapacitation instead?

5) Institutional program. Put numbers on it. If you were chairing a reform commission, what decarceration target (percentage and timeline) would you set, which offense categories would you divert first, and how would you reallocate dollars to housing/health/education? What metrics—beyond recidivism—would you use to evaluate success (e.g., community safety, survivor well‑being, reduced racial disparities, material security indices)?

6) Engage the panel. 
   - To Chen/Villanueva: if we keep an S ceiling, what additional anti‑domination guardrails must be added (e.g., automatic downward adjustments tied to measures of structural deprivation; presumptive diversion for poverty‑driven offenses)?
   - To Strauss: does “moral accounting” risk re‑inscribing social hierarchies when the material preconditions of agency are unequal? What would a deontic theory look like that conditions punishment on distributive justice audits?
   - To Holm: can “legitimacy costs” be operationalized without importing community sentiments that are themselves racialized? What’s the methodological fix?

7) Death penalty. Give us your structural abolition case in two moves: (a) why capital punishment is inseparable from racialized state violence even under refurbished procedures; and (b) why the resources consumed by capital systems should be reallocated, specifying which survivor‑support and community‑safety programs yield the largest returns.

Please don’t just critique—design. Offer at least two concrete rule changes or statutory provisions you would draft tomorrow that would move us toward your model while addressing Bedau’s charge that theories must speak to actual institutions, not just ideals.

### Speaker: Dr. Nolan Baptiste

Thank you, Chair. Let me take Bedau’s invitation—really Murphy’s—and keep us in non‑ideal space. Under background injustice, “fair‑play”/unfair‑advantage stories (R3) don’t justify inflicting hard treatment; they presuppose the very distributive floor that’s missing. And a great deal of what we’re calling R2—however refined—travels with background power. I’ll diagnose where, then give you an alternative architecture with rules you can draft tomorrow.

1) Structural diagnosis: where “measured proportionality” launders domination

Even with Prof. Chen’s exclusions and Judge Villanueva’s guardrails, bias seeps in at design, data, and doctrine.

- Item content and valuations:
  - Autonomy‑loss scales are norm‑laden. Whose “credible‑risk environment” counts as severe? A woman in a gated suburb vs a woman in public housing? If panels are demographically skewed or culturally framed, S bakes in middle‑class white sensibilities despite best efforts.
  - “Abuse of trust/office” aggravates for a public official but not for an employer who steals wages or uses ICE threats to coerce. The latter is structurally trust‑violating, yet typically sits outside high bands.

- Offense definitions:
  - Street drug sales are felonies keyed to place, proximity to schools, and “public nuisance”; suburban delivery markets and cryptomarkets with the same volumes are less policed, coded as “non‑public,” and trigger fewer aggravators. S and PIS punish the over‑policed market as “riskier,” entrenching place‑based inequality.
  - Survival theft is a felony at low thresholds in many states; wage theft and tax evasion that dwarf it in aggregate harm are misdemeanors or civil. S can’t fix asymmetrical criminalization.

- Policing inputs and measurement:
  - Weapon‑use and “public‑space risk” aggravators are observed where police saturate. The presence of a gun is detected in Black neighborhoods; the same gun in a white living room is never measured. Risk isn’t just higher; measurement error is nonrandom and racialized.
  - “Community legitimacy costs” risks smuggling back desert through majoritarian sentiments that are themselves racialized. If you weight PIS by “what the public will accept,” you reinscribe who the public imagines as dangerous.

- Case comparisons (same social harm, different class/race):
  - Drug markets: Street‑corner seller (Black, surveilled) with a pistol → S spikes on R (risked harm) and H (credible‑risk environment); PIS favors severity for general deterrence of weapon carry. Private network seller (white, unarmed) with larger volumes → lower S and PIS. Social harm equal or higher in the latter, but the scheme punishes the former.
  - Survival theft vs wage/tax theft: A homeless mother shoplifts $200 of formula, scuffles at the exit (R goes up). A contractor steals $20,000 in wages across 10 workers; a high earner cheats $50,000 in taxes. The latter’s aggregate H is far higher; S (as currently conceived) centers immediate physical autonomy losses and underweights diffuse economic harms. The result is inverted seriousness.
  - Environmental crime: Lead emitter poisoning a census tract vs aggravated robbery with no injury. Population‑level capability loss dwarfs robbery harms. Yet S’s H/R items are built for acute incidents; environmental crimes slip into low bands.

Conclusion: you can sanitize inputs and publish weights, but under non‑ideal criminal codes and policing, S‑bands, PIS, and grids still allocate coercion along classed and racial lines.

2) Replacement architecture: anti‑domination/public‑health frame; a minimal penal footprint

- Justificatory principle: anti‑domination plus public health. The state may use coercion only to prevent ongoing subordination (interpersonal or structural) and serious, imminent physical harm, and only after it has met baseline duties (housing, income, health care) that enable lawful compliance. Coercion must be the least subordinating effective means.

- Liability gate: retain R1/A2 minimally—culpable conduct is necessary for any penal response—but add a distributive precondition: no custodial hard treatment absent a finding that the state provided baseline capabilities reasonably accessible to the person. Exhaustion of non‑penal measures is required.

- What remains penal: a narrow class—(i) ongoing lethal violence; (ii) demonstrable coercive control with high imminent risk; (iii) organized offenses that pose serious bodily harm where administrative controls fail. Everything else shifts to non‑penal regulation:
  - Civil protection and exclusion orders with swift, non‑custodial enforcement.
  - Licensing, bonding, and administrative incapacitation for dangerous practices (e.g., revoke corporate charters; bar licenses).
  - Fines and restitution keyed to income/wealth; debarment; corporate monitorships.
  - Public‑health interventions: overdose prevention, syringe access, MOUD for substance use; housing‑first.

3) High‑harm violence: a decarceral, safety‑first regime

- Core safety stack:
  - Immediate protective orders; firearm relinquishment within 24–48 hours with verified compliance.
  - Subsidized emergency relocation, lock changes, and guaranteed income/housing for survivors; legal advocacy.
  - Electronic/geofencing controls on the respondent, time‑limited and strictly overseen; real‑time response protocols co‑designed with community advocates.
  - Specialized IPV/SA units staffed with clinicians and culturally‑competent advocates; evidence‑based treatment for persons who offend (where they engage) and batterer intervention programs that meet standards.

- Custodial threshold: authorize incapacitation only upon judicial finding, on clear and convincing evidence, of high imminent risk (validated tool plus qualitative evidence) or repeated, willful violations of safety orders; impose the minimum term necessary to break the sequence; pair with mandated treatment; periodic review.

- Avoid reproducing harms:
  - Data minimization (no sharing EM data with immigration or predictive policing); strict sunsets; independent community oversight boards with survivor representation; audits of racialized EM deployment and violation responses; graduated, proportionate responses to technical violations.

4) Restorative justice under non‑ideal conditions: design to prevent status weaponization

- Non‑negotiables:
  - Sliding‑scale monetary duties and caps; service obligations capped per month; never allow wealth to buy down time.
  - Independent gateways: court‑appointed RJ coordinators with authority independent of prosecution; eligibility based on offense/risk criteria, not bargaining leverage.
  - Ban “RJ as leverage”: statutory prohibition on charging up to extract repair; “no‑worse‑off” rule—opting into RJ cannot produce a harsher custodial fallback than the guideline baseline.
  - Community governance: boards composed of survivors and formerly incarcerated persons to set curricula, select facilitators, and audit outcomes; publish demographics of uptake and completion.

- Hard lines for incapacitation: credible lethal threats; stalking with weapons; tampering with monitors tied to safety orders; repeated, escalating violations. Otherwise, repair plus controls are presumptive.

5) Institutional program: targets, sequence, dollars, metrics

- Decarceration target: 50% reduction in prison population in 5 years; 75% in 10.
  - Phase 1 (24 months): presumptive diversion for drug possession; low‑level sales under a threshold; non‑burglary property under a raised felony floor; technical violations of supervision; parole detainers for nonviolent conduct. Goal: 30% reduction.
  - Phase 2 (years 3–5): expand to burglary without injury; felony theft under $5,000; non‑weapon robberies with no injury; shorten lengths across remaining categories with earned‑time. Goal: another 20%.

- Reallocation: assume $50–80k per prison‑year saved. Redirect 60% to housing‑first slots; 20% to mobile crisis and mental‑health; 10% to IPV/SA survivor services; 10% to youth employment/violence‑interruption. Publish a line‑item “justice reinvestment” ledger.

- Success metrics (publicly reported quarterly):
  - Violent victimization rate per 100,000 (disaggregated by neighborhood and race).
  - Survivor well‑being indices (housing stability; PTSD symptom scales; satisfaction with system responses).
  - Racial disparity index in arrests, charging, sentencing, and sanctions.
  - Material security indices (housing stability; poverty rate; youth school attendance).
  - Clearance rates for serious violence (and time to charge).
  - Community trust measures (procedural justice surveys) with oversamples of marginalized groups.

6) Engagements with the panel

- To Prof. Chen and Judge Villanueva: if S stays as a ceiling, add anti‑domination guardrails:
  - Structural Deprivation Adjustment: when a defendant’s neighborhood deprivation index or individual deprivation markers exceed a statutory threshold (homelessness; food insecurity), automatic one‑band downward shift unless the state proves it met baseline provision duties; this is not “excuse,” it’s a distributive precondition.
  - Presumptive diversion for poverty‑driven offenses (codified definition).
  - Require an “Aggregate Harm Module” in S for corporate, environmental, wage, and tax crimes—so aggregate capability losses can place such cases into Bands 6–7.
  - Forbid police‑only data feeds for S items; require corroboration from non‑police sources (medical/clinical, community affidavits) for risked‑harm assessments. DIF tests and disparate‑impact audits must be binding: if bias persists, weights are suspended by rule.

- To Prof. Strauss: your moral accounting presumes agents had fair chances to comply. A deontic theory under non‑ideal conditions must condition punitive eligibility on a Distributive Justice Audit: did the state meet duties that make the norm one we can fairly expect compliance with? If the answer is “no,” only minimal liability (R1/A2) remains—and only reparative, non‑carceral duties are permissible, save imminent safety cases.

- To Dr. Holm: “legitimacy costs” can’t be measured by raw public sentiment. Methodological fix: vignette‑based, blinded surveys that mask race/class cues; reweight samples to correct for racial/SES imbalances; validate against behavior (reporting and cooperation rates) rather than stated attitudes. Publish the models; forbid use of “community fear” metrics derived from media or social media which are racially skewed.

7) Death penalty: structural abolition

- Inseparability from racialized state violence:
  - County‑level lynching rates predict modern death sentencing; the victim’s race drives capital charging; “heinousness” maps onto racialized narratives of dangerousness. Centralized charging and blind screens cannot erase the cultural sediment. Capital punishment functions as a status ritual of domination.

- Reallocation:
  - Each capital case imposes $1–3 million in marginal costs over LWOP. Abolish; reallocate to:
    - Homicide clearance squads (evidence‑based training; forensic capacity). Clearing homicides deters more reliably than executions.
    - Survivor support: long‑term financial stipends; trauma‑informed counseling; relocation funds.
    - Hospital‑based violence intervention; credible‑messenger programs; youth jobs—programs with demonstrated reductions in shootings.

Two draftable rules/statutes for tomorrow

- Distributive Preconditions for Custody Act:
  - “No court shall impose a custodial sentence unless it finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (a) the defendant, during the relevant period, had access to baseline housing, health care, and income supports sufficient to meet basic needs; and (b) non‑penal, less restrictive alternatives—including civil protection, reparative obligations, and administrative controls—have been attempted or are demonstrably inadequate to prevent imminent serious harm. Absent such findings, the sentence shall consist solely of non‑custodial measures. An exception lies for cases with a judicial finding of high imminent risk of serious bodily harm.”
  - Pair with a state duty: “The court shall order the responsible agency to provide the baseline supports as a condition of any supervision.”

- Equal Harms Enforcement and Corporate Accountability Act:
  - “For offenses defined by aggregate harms (environmental pollution causing measurable health losses; wage theft above $5,000; tax fraud above $10,000), the seriousness index shall include an Aggregate Harm score reflecting population‑level capability losses; such offenses are eligible for Bands 6–7. The Attorney General shall establish a Corporate Crime Unit; felony liability extends to responsible executives where willful or reckless endangerment is shown. Annual reports shall compare enforcement intensity and S‑band usage across violent and aggregate‑harm categories.”

Add two more clean‑up provisions:
- Presumptive Diversion for Poverty‑Driven Offenses: codify a rebuttable presumption of non‑custodial, reparative sanctions where credible evidence shows material need as primary driver and no injury occurred.
- Technical Violations Reform: prohibit incarceration for technical supervision violations absent a new arrest for violent conduct; require graduated, non‑custodial responses.

Closing thought

Bedau asked for a theory that speaks to institutions. The through‑line of my proposals is simple: under non‑ideal conditions, retribution (R3) is not available, and proportionality (R2) is not neutral. If we keep any penal power, it must be subordinated to anti‑domination and public health; it must be minimized; and it must be conditioned on the state doing its distributive part. If we retain Prof. Chen’s S at all, embed it in that frame—with structural adjustments, distributive audits, and enforcement parity for aggregate harms—lest “doing justice” become the latest language in which we reproduce the very hierarchies punishment claims to condemn.
