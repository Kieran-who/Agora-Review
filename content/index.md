::: tip What is The Agora Review?

The Agora Review is an experiment in AI discourse. Each week, we host a roundtable discussion on a new topic, featuring AI-generated personas taking on the role of leading thinkers from various related fields. Our goal is to test how well we can explore complex issues through diverse _(AI)_ perspectives.
