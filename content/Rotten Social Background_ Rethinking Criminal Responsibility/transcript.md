### Speaker: Host

To ground us empirically: if we were to recognize a narrowly tailored RSB excuse on a dyscontrol theory, what concrete evidentiary threshold should a court require to link environment to impaired volitional control in the instant offense? Please be specific about the indicators (e.g., longitudinal deprivation measures, toxin exposure, trauma history) and the causal design you’d deem sufficient at the individual level to move from correlation to case-level attribution, while keeping the gate tight enough to avoid a floodgates problem.

---

### Speaker: Prof. Lila Santiago

Thanks, Chair. If we are serious about a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse, we have to make “caused substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of offense” do real work. I would operationalize that with a two‑stage gate: a documented, cumulative exposure profile that makes dyscontrol mechanistically plausible, and a case‑specific attribution showing proximate volitional impairment in the instant event. The defense bears the burden (I’d accept clear and convincing) and must satisfy both stages with converging, independent evidence.

Stage 1. Eligibility screen: longitudinal deprivation with at least one biologically plausible insult
Require objective documentation, not just narrative, with thresholds keyed to known criminogenic mechanisms.

A. Cumulative social deprivation (need at least two of the following, spanning childhood/adolescence):
- Neighborhood deprivation: residence for ≥8 of first 18 years in tracts in the top decile of Area Deprivation Index (or ICE inequality) and top quartile violent‑crime exposure.
- School deprivation: K‑12 attendance in districts in the bottom quintile of per‑pupil spending and/or schools under desegregation/finance orders during attendance, with verified concentrated poverty (>75% free/reduced lunch).
- Housing instability: ≥2 documented evictions or ≥6 months of homelessness/shelter placement before age 18.
- Caregiver labor instability: household unemployment/underemployment ≥50% of months during ages 10–18, verified by state UI records.

B. Early adversity/trauma (need at least one, independently corroborated):
- Substantiated CPS findings of physical/sexual abuse or neglect; or caregiver incarceration ≥12 months; or witnessed homicide/serious violence (police reports or hospital records).
- Validated instrument score above clinical thresholds: ACEs ≥4 with at least one severe category; or PTSD Checklist for DSM‑5 (PCL‑5) above cutoff, administered by a qualified clinician.

C. Biological/physiological insults (need at least one):
- Documented blood lead history ≥5 µg/dL (CDC reference) in childhood, preferably with repeated measures or a single level ≥10 µg/dL; or residence in a unit subject to a HUD/EPA lead hazard control order contemporaneous with childhood.
- Iron‑deficiency anemia (Hgb/Hct with ferritin consistent with IDA) during key developmental periods; or documented early malnutrition (WIC/clinical records).
- Prenatal alcohol or drug exposure (medical records/child welfare documentation) consistent with FASD risk.
- Chronic sleep disruption due to environmental stressors (e.g., police calls, crowding) supported by collateral records (school truancy/discipline tied to sleep) and, where feasible, actigraphy/sleep clinic data.

Stage 2. Case‑level attribution: proximate dyscontrol at time of offense
Here we move from population correlation to individual causation using triangulation and Bradford Hill‑style logic (temporality, plausibility, dose‑response), while excluding better explanations.

A. Event characteristics consistent with reactive dyscontrol:
- Offense is affective/reactive (seconds–minutes after acute provocation), with minimal planning, disorganized execution, and contemporaneous witnesses describing dissociation, “seeing red,” or marked autonomic arousal; post‑event confusion/amnesia supports but does not by itself suffice.
- No evidence of instrumental, goal‑directed planning (e.g., luring, preparation, concealment).

B. Neurocognitive profile (administered within 60–90 days, with performance validity checks):
- Executive control deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two domains directly tied to inhibition/affect regulation (e.g., Go/No‑Go/Stop‑Signal, Stroop interference, Wisconsin Card Sorting perseverations, delay discounting), with intact effort indices (e.g., TOMM, embedded PVTs).
- Low psychopathic traits (e.g., PCL‑R below moderate range), consistent with impulsive rather than predatory aggression.

C. Psychiatric/physiological linkage:
- Diagnosed trauma‑related or impulse‑control disorder (e.g., PTSD with dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) where symptom timing and content plausibly map onto the index offense; corroborated by longitudinal clinical/educational records (not created ex post).
- Where available, biological markers consistent with chronic stress neurobiology (e.g., flattened diurnal cortisol via salivary/hair assays) or historic toxin exposure (prior BLLs). I would not require fMRI, but I would admit it only as supportive, not determinative.

D. Dose–response and temporality:
- Show that the severity/duration of exposures in Stage 1 predict the magnitude of measured deficits in Stage 2 (e.g., higher historical BLLs correlate with poorer inhibition; higher ACEs with greater affective lability), and that these impairments pre‑dated the offense (school/juvenile records of impulse dyscontrol, not just post‑charge testing).

E. Alternative cause exclusion/negative controls:
- Rule out primary drivers inconsistent with dyscontrol excuse: substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause; frank psychosis unrelated to RSB; malingering; or strong evidence of calculated, instrumental motive.
- Where feasible, use within‑person or sibling negative controls (e.g., sibling without lead exposure or with markedly different school/housing conditions) to strengthen attribution; not dispositive but probative.

Procedural safeguards to keep the gate tight and equitable
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health to avoid “culture shopping.”
- Notice requirement and standardized templates for documentary proof (medical labs, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD, UI records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Constrain applicability to reactive violent offenses and, exceptionally, to truly impulsive nonviolent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.
- Funding parity: courts must resource indigent defendants to meet these showings, or the doctrine will be a dead letter and exacerbate inequality.

Disposition
If the excuse is found, I favor ESB‑oriented noncarceral dispositions under court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition and sleep interventions, job pipelines), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. This answers Ms. Whitford’s victim‑protection concern and preserves legitimacy, while avoiding the expressive endorsement that troubles Prof. Watkins.

Why this won’t open the floodgates
Requiring convergence across (1) longitudinal, objective deprivation; (2) at least one documented biological insult; (3) neurocognitive evidence with validity checks; (4) event‑level markers of reactive dyscontrol; and (5) exclusion of alternatives will make this a rare defense, largely confined to the top tail of cumulative adversity and the subset of cases where mechanism and moment line up. In a big‑city docket, you might see a small single‑digit percentage of violent cases even qualify for a hearing, and fewer still succeed.

I want to push back gently on Prof. Watkins’s worry about disrespecting victims: the unfairness limit here is Hart’s—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply. We honor victims by targeting ESB conditions that reduce recurrence and by reserving full condemnation for those who had a fair shot and chose otherwise. And to Judge Ellery’s administrability point: pre‑specified thresholds, neutral experts, and a narrow offense domain are the institutional guardrails that keep this morally honest and practically governable.

---

### Speaker: Host

Please assess Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 attribution criteria. Are the proposed neurocognitive batteries (e.g., stop-signal, Stroop, WCST with validity checks) and stress markers (e.g., diurnal cortisol, historic BLLs) sufficiently specific and temporally sensitive to support an inference of substantial volitional impairment at the moment of offense? What minimum bundle of converging findings would you require to meet a clear-and-convincing threshold, and what scientific pitfalls—state–trait confounds, malingering, acute intoxication, reverse causation—should courts be most alert to when weighing this evidence?

---

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

Thanks, Chair. Short answer: none of the suggested measures is, by itself, either specific enough or temporally precise enough to prove loss of volitional control at the moment of offense. As a convergent bundle, however—anchored by event-level phenomenology and pre-offense documentation—they can support a clear-and-convincing inference of reactive dyscontrol. The science can take us to “highly likely” impairment in a narrow subset of cases; it cannot time-stamp control failure to the second. So the gate has to demand alignment across mechanism, history, and moment.

On the proposed tools

- Neurocognitive tests
  - Stop-signal/Go–No-Go with valid estimation of stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) are the closest we have to assays of inhibitory control; effect sizes linking adversity/toxins to SSRT are moderate, but the tasks are susceptible to state noise (sleep loss, meds, motivation).
  - Stroop interference taps interference resolution more than motor inhibition; it is useful as part of a battery but has poor specificity to dyscontrol.
  - WCST primarily measures set-shifting; it is the least specific to the mechanism we care about and I would downweight it. I’d add antisaccade and flanker tasks, and include an affective variant (emotional Go–No-Go or affective Stroop) because many “reflexive” assaults are triggered under negative affect.
  - All testing must include multiple performance-validity tests (embedded and stand-alone) and be repeated or corroborated to mitigate transient state effects.

- Stress and exposure markers
  - Diurnal cortisol: a flattened slope or blunted awakening response is consistent with chronic stress/PTSD but not specific; single-day salivary profiles are noisy. Hair cortisol (3 cm segment) gives a 3‑month window and is more robust for chronic load, though still confounded by hair treatments and ethnicity.
  - Historic blood lead levels (BLLs) are probative of developmental insult to prefrontal systems if the elevations occurred during sensitive windows (early childhood). They are not moment-to-moment indices, but in the presence of executive deficits they strengthen causal plausibility.
  - Iron deficiency/malnutrition records are supportive, again not specific.
  - I’d consider adding autonomic markers where feasible: low resting high-frequency HRV (vagal tone) and heightened threat-potentiated startle support an affect-regulation mechanism, though these are supportive, not determinative.

Minimum convergence to meet a clear-and-convincing standard

I would require five pillars, with no single pillar sufficient:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near-immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of planning/cover-up; contemporaneous descriptions (“went blank,” “saw red,” marked tremor/tachycardia); ideally video/911 audio/bodycam corroboration. If there was luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental behavior, the defense should presumptively fail.

2) Pre-offense, documented history of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing episodic, stimulus-bound loss of control: school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental health notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption documentation. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse-causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect-regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No-Go or affective Stroop), with intact performance-validity indices and stability across sessions or cross-test convergence. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available.
- Low to moderate PCL‑R scores (or alternative trait measures) to support an impulsive/reactive rather than predatory profile, used cautiously given the PCL‑R’s limitations.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- A DSM‑5 trauma/impulse-control diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established by a qualified clinician with structured instruments, anchored to exposures documented in Stage 1 and with symptom content that plausibly explains the index event (triggers, dissociation). Biological corroboration of chronic stress (hair cortisol flattening or similar) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one developmental biological insult documented independent of litigation: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or a prior ≥10), iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition markers, or a well-documented FASD risk, plus corroboration that these exposures predate and plausibly contribute to current executive deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls:
- Toxicology: no substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; in general, voluntary intoxication should defeat the excuse.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, consistency across sessions, collateral informant reports. Coaching and symptom over-reporting are common in forensic settings.
- Alternative cause exclusion: rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless the psychosis itself is directly traceable to RSB exposures, which is rare and requires a different doctrine), acute TBI at the time of offense, and clear instrumental motives.
- Timing: testing should occur as early as feasible (ideally within 30–60 days) and be repeated or triangulated; rely heavily on pre-offense records to avoid the “forensic artifact” problem.

Scientific pitfalls the court should watch for

- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and acute legal stress can depress executive performance and cortisol. Standardize testing (sleep, caffeine, meds) and, where possible, repeat or corroborate with pre-offense records. Actigraphy or collateral sleep documentation can help.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use a battery of embedded and stand-alone validity measures; be wary of “too bad to be true” profiles or selective impairment on tasks easy to feign.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol and stimulants both degrade inhibition; the law generally treats voluntary intoxication as non-exculpatory. Distinguish “toxin history” (lead, FASD) from acute substance effects.
- Reverse causation: Post‑offense incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and degrade performance; hair cortisol helps with pre‑offense windows; the strongest antidote is pre‑charge documentation (school, pediatric, CPS, housing, EPA records).
- Over-interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI, EEG, and cortisol all suffer from low individual-level specificity. Avoid reverse inference (“reduced vmPFC activation therefore no control”); treat imaging as at most supportive and admit it only with rigorous Daubert scrutiny.
- Low base rates and PPV: Many people with adversity and executive deficits never commit violent crimes. That is why the event signature and temporality matter so much.

A few refinements to Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2

- Replace or supplement WCST with antisaccade and an affect-laden inhibition task. Consider computational modeling (e.g., drift–diffusion parameters from SST) to strengthen mechanistic inference beyond raw SSRT.
- Add heart-rate variability (resting HF‑HRV) or startle potentiation as optional supportive measures of emotion-regulation capacity and threat reactivity, with the caveat of limited forensic norms.
- Tighten the timeline: aim to collect psychophysiology/neuropsych within 30–60 days and weight pre‑offense records heavily.

Bottom line

If the defense can show (1) a classic reactive event pattern; (2) pre‑offense documentation of stimulus-bound dyscontrol; (3) validated inhibitory deficits on at least two tasks; (4) a trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis that maps to the event; (5) at least one objective developmental insult consistent with the mechanism; and (6) clean rule‑outs for intoxication, malingering, and instrumental planning, I would be prepared to say, with scientific integrity, that volitional control was substantially degraded and that the degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act. Anything less, and we’re back in the realm of population‑level correlation, which cannot carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden at guilt.

---

### Speaker: Host

Given Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence, design a pretrial gatekeeping protocol under Rule 702/Daubert for an RSB‑dyscontrol excuse. What precisely must a defendant proffer to get to the jury (documents, tests, diagnoses), what should be excluded categorically, and how would you structure the hearing to minimize error costs? Please give a concise bench checklist (bulleted) a trial judge could use.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

Short answer: as stand‑alone items, none of Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 tools can time‑stamp loss of control; as a convergent bundle layered on a strong event signature and pre‑offense documentation, they can justify a clear‑and‑convincing inference of reactive dyscontrol in a narrow slice of cases. The court’s task is gatekeeping and channeling: require ex ante thresholds, neutral expertise, and tight offense‑domain limits so juries hear only evidence that truly speaks to volitional incapacity at the moment.

1) Are the proposed measures specific and temporally sensitive enough?
- Event‑level evidence is primary. The only things that reach “the moment” are circumstances of the offense: sudden provocation, seconds‑to‑minutes escalation, disorganized execution, contemporaneous descriptions (“went blank,” “saw red”), absence of planning or concealment. Without this, Stage‑2 fails.
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) index trait‑like inhibitory control with some state noise. They are probative of capacity, not timing; useful only if administered with performance‑validity tests, repeated or cross‑validated, and interpreted conservatively.
- WCST has low mechanism specificity; I would downweight or omit it.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic BLLs are supportive of mechanism and temporality (for BLLs, if elevations occurred in sensitive windows), not decisive for the instant offense.
- Brain imaging (fMRI) is high‑gloss, low probative value for momentary control; I would generally exclude under Rule 403/Daubert except as background in bench hearings.

2) Minimum convergence I would require (clear and convincing)
All five pillars, plus absence of disqualifiers:

A. Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Acute, salient trigger; rapid escalation; no luring or weapon staging; no post‑event instrumental behavior; ideally corroborated by video/911/body‑cam or multiple witnesses.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the charge: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption records.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT on Stop‑Signal, antisaccade error rates, affective Go‑No‑Go), intact effort indices (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs), and either stability across two sessions or cross‑test convergence; low–moderate psychopathic trait profile to support impulsive (not predatory) aggression.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom content and triggers plausibly explaining the incident; biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one developmental insult documented independent of litigation (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a prior ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), predating and plausibly contributing to current deficits.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one defeats the excuse absent extraordinary proof)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver.
- Evidence of planning, luring, concealment, or instrumental motive.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the scene.
- Malingering/secondary gain indicators (failed PVTs, “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles).

3) Scientific/legal pitfalls the court should police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medications, or incarceration stress can depress test performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer hair cortisol over single‑day salivary; give weight to pre‑charge records.
- Malingering: Use multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; consider test‑retest consistency; require collateral informants.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑offense stress can generate abnormal physiology and symptoms; anchor the story in pre‑offense records.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: Stage‑1 exposures raise risk but do not compel Stage‑2 impairment; do not let population data stand in for individual attribution.
- Over‑reliance on nonspecific measures: WCST and generic Stroop are weak; fMRI is prejudicial; PCL‑R must be used cautiously.
- Cultural/measurement bias: Ensure norms and instruments are appropriate across languages and demographics; appoint neutral experts.

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability and legitimacy)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Offense limitation: restrict the excuse to clearly reactive violent offenses (e.g., sudden homicides/assaults); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden/standard: defendant bears clear‑and‑convincing burden that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Bifurcation and instructions: hold a separate responsibility phase; give a standardized instruction defining “substantial impairment” (an inability to inhibit despite awareness, not mere anger) and requiring contemporaneity; use special interrogatories to preserve review.
- Rule 403 discipline: exclude brain images and other “wow‑factor” exhibits; limit experts to methodology and findings; forbid ultimate‑issue testimony if the jurisdiction so prefers.

Bottom line: With a strong, corroborated event signature; pre‑offense history; valid inhibition deficits; a diagnosis that maps to the incident; and an objective developmental insult—and with obvious alternative drivers excluded—the court can, in rare cases, be satisfied to a clear‑and‑convincing standard that the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply at the moment. Anything less invites exactly the administrability and floodgates problems that have long worried courts about open‑textured RSB doctrines.

---

### Speaker: Host

Please complete your assessment. In particular: (1) finish distinguishing chronic toxin/RSB exposures from acute voluntary intoxication at the moment of offense; (2) flag the key reverse‑causation and state–trait confounds courts should watch for (e.g., post‑charge stress effects on testing, sleep, meds); (3) speak to base‑rate/false‑positive risks and how to keep them low; (4) say whether pre‑offense school/medical records should be a necessary condition; and (5) your view on the probative value, if any, of fMRI in individual adjudication under a clear‑and‑convincing standard.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

Thanks, Chair. Picking up where I left off:

Scientific pitfalls the court should watch for (continued)
- Over-interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI/EEG findings are group-level and task-context dependent; they lack individual diagnostic specificity and are vulnerable to analytic flexibility and circular inference. Admit only as supportive context from qualified experts; never treat an activation map as proof of momentary loss of control.
- Base-rate and specificity problems: Executive deficits are common across many psychiatric and forensic samples; the presence of a deficit is not specific to RSB causation or to reactive aggression. Courts should weigh patterns (reactive phenotype) rather than single abnormalities.
- Test–retest and practice effects: One-off poor performance can reflect unfamiliarity or anxiety. Where feasible, repeat key tasks or demonstrate cross-task convergence; document testing conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine).
- Measurement noise in cortisol: Single-day salivary profiles are unreliable; prefer hair cortisol for pre-offense windows and interpret with cautions about hair treatments and ethnic differences.
- Ecological and causal layering: Multiple adversities (lead, malnutrition, trauma, sleep) co-occur; causal claims should rely on temporality and dose–response within the individual (e.g., childhood BLLs preceding enduring inhibition deficits), not on broad epidemiology alone.

Are the proposed tools sufficient?
- Alone, no. As a convergent bundle aligned with the event signature and pre-offense history, they can meet a clear-and-convincing threshold in a narrow slice of cases. The science supports “highly likely substantial impairment of inhibitory control” but cannot time-stamp volition at the second.

Minimum bundle I would require (all five pillars plus disqualifier screen)
1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol: rapid escalation after salient provocation; disorganized act; no planning/cover-up; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/bodycam or multiple witnesses) of dissociation/marked autonomic arousal.
2) Pre-offense documentation of dyscontrol: nonforensic, predating records (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile/clinical notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits, documented chronic sleep disruption).
3) Neurocognitive profile with validity: ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect-regulation tasks (e.g., stop-signal SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No-Go/Stroop), intact performance-validity indices, and cross-task or session convergence; low–moderate psychopathic traits consistent with impulsive, not predatory, aggression.
4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage: structured-diagnosis PTSD (dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder with symptoms mapping to the index trigger; supportive chronic-stress biomarker (hair cortisol flattening) desirable but not mandatory.
5) Objective developmental insult: independently documented exposure consistent with prefrontal dysmaturation (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a peak ≥10; iron-deficiency/malnutrition; FASD risk), temporally preceding the deficits.

Disqualifiers and controls (any one should presumptively defeat the excuse unless persuasively rebutted)
- Clear instrumental planning or concealment; strong goal-directed motive.
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at offense.
- Malingering/secondary gain indicators (failed multiple PVTs, inconsistent profiles).
- Purely post-charge abnormalities without pre-offense corroboration.

Process safeguards
- Early, structured proffer and Daubert-style hearing; court-appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Standardized documentation templates (medical labs, pediatric BLLs, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD, unemployment records; geocoded exposure history).
- Testing within 30–60 days where feasible, with documentation of state factors (sleep, meds) and, when possible, limited retest or collateral-task convergence.

Bottom line
These measures, used together and anchored in pre-offense records and event-level corroboration, can justify a narrow dyscontrol excuse under a clear-and-convincing standard. They cannot and should not be used to backfill planned violence or to generalize from adversity to automatic exculpation. When the gate is this tight, we minimize false positives, respect victims, and reserve the doctrine for the rare, mechanistically plausible “reflexive assault” that Delgado and Bazelon had in mind. Dispositions should be ESB-oriented with supervision, reserving civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, can you translate Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions into a concrete, courtroom‑ready framework? Please propose: (i) a pretrial admissibility rule (burden, Daubert hearing, offense limits, disqualifiers like voluntary intoxication/instrumentality); and (ii) a short model jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control due to rotten social background” and how jurors should weigh Stage‑2 evidence. Aim for administrability and legitimacy—tight enough to avoid floodgates and disparate application, but usable by real trial courts.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Two reactions from the bench’s vantage: first, on what science can responsibly carry into the courtroom; second, on the institutional guardrails needed to keep error costs tolerable.

On the Stage 2 attribution showing
- Specificity/temporality. I agree with Dr. Chen: no single neurocognitive task (SSRT, Stroop, WCST) or stress biomarker (salivary/hair cortisol, historic BLLs) time‑stamps loss of control at T0. These are supportive of mechanism, not dispositive of moment. Courts should treat them as corroborative, never as stand‑alone proof of volitional defeat.
- What’s admissible under Rule 702/Daubert. Well‑constructed inhibition tasks with validity indices are generally accepted; effect sizes are modest and inter‑individual noise is real. Historic lead levels and documented early malnutrition are reliable records of developmental insult; diurnal/hair cortisol is probative of chronic stress with known confounds. fMRI belongs, if at all, as background science, not case‑level attribution.

Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard
I would require convergence on all five prongs; failure on any should defeat the excuse:
1) Event signature. Near‑immediate, affective/reactive aggression after a salient trigger; disorganization; no luring/staging/cover‑up; contemporaneous descriptions of dissociation or autonomic arousal; ideally objective corroboration (video/911/bodycam).
2) Pre‑offense documentation. Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEPs/discipline, juvenile or ED notes, CPS records) evidencing stimulus‑bound explosive reactivity or dissociation. This is the best antidote to reverse causation.
3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity. At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go), stable across sessions, with multiple performance‑validity tests passed. Downweight WCST; include an impulsive‑choice measure if available. Trait profile should be inconsistent with predatory aggression.
4) Clinical linkage. A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom pattern plausibly maps onto the index event; no ex post facto fabrication; biological stress corroboration helpful but not required.
5) Objective exposure biomarker. Independent documentation of at least one developmental biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated—or verified early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency; credible FASD risk), with a plausible pathway to the measured control deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; cross‑source consistency; beware “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Alternative explanations: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI, or clear instrumental motives.
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing (sleep/meds), prefer early testing with repetition, and lean heavily on pre‑offense records.

Procedural guardrails to manage error costs
- Pretrial proffer/hearing. Require a structured proffer keyed to the five‑prong bundle; appoint neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Domain limits. Confine the excuse to genuinely reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime. Where proof is strong but shy of automatism‑like loss of control, channel to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (homicide) or to sentencing mitigation.
- Burden/standard. Place the burden on the defense, clear and convincing evidence, that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Jury instructions. Give a specialized instruction: biomarkers and test scores are supportive only; ordinary poverty, anger, or stress do not suffice; voluntary intoxication negates the excuse; the question is fair opportunity to conform at the time.
- Funding parity. Indigent defendants must have resources to meet the showing, or the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

Disposition
Where the excuse is found, I favor noncarceral ESB dispositions under supervision (trauma‑focused treatment, nutrition/sleep interventions, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, job pathways), with civil commitment available only upon the usual dangerousness/mental‑illness showing. In close cases, use grading mitigation rather than full exculpation.

Bottom line
The Santiago criteria, refined along Dr. Chen’s lines, can be made administrable if courts insist on the full, convergent bundle and keep the doctrine tightly cabined to reactive violence. That balances Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair chance to comply—against the real risks of false positives, victim disrespect, and floodgates.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, could you propose a concise, plain‑English model jury instruction for a narrowly tailored RSB dyscontrol excuse that is administrable and preserves public legitimacy? Please specify: (a) the elements the jury must find (by clear and convincing evidence) to conclude substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense and that this impairment substantially contributed to the act; (b) categorical disqualifiers (e.g., planning, voluntary intoxication); and (c) whether you would bifurcate and how you would word a limiting instruction to prevent the jury from using deprivation evidence as mere sympathy or character evidence.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s central caution: no single laboratory or clinical measure can time‑stamp loss of control. If we are to use Stage 2 to support an excuse at guilt, the law has to insist on convergence across mechanism, history, and moment, and keep the domain narrow.

What I would require, as a matter of admissibility and sufficiency

1) Offense signature (event‑level)
- Reactive, affective violence within a very short window after a salient provocation (measured in seconds, not minutes), with disorganized execution and no evidence of instrumental preparation or cover‑up.
- Corroboration by neutral indicia where feasible (video, 911/body‑cam audio, contemporaneous witness accounts of “blanking out,” marked autonomic arousal). If there is luring, staging, weapon retrieval from another location, pursuit over distance, reloading after a pause, or concealment, the defense should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense history (nonforensic)
- Documentary, pre‑charge evidence of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol: school IEP/discipline, pediatric or juvenile mental health notes, prior ED presentations for rage/dissociation, sleep disruption. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact” concerns.

3) Neurocognitive profile (with validity)
- At least two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks showing deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), administered by a qualified examiner within 60–90 days, with multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests. I would downweight WCST; it’s not specific to the mechanism at issue.
- A trait profile consistent with impulsive, not predatory, aggression (low–moderate psychopathy scores used cautiously).

4) Psychiatric linkage
- A structured DSM‑5 diagnosis consistent with the mechanism (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to exposures documented long before the offense, with symptom content that plausibly maps the trigger and reaction in the index event. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) are supportive, not determinative.

5) Developmental exposure biomarker
- At least one objectively documented biological insult predating adulthood that plausibly compromises prefrontal control (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a prior ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), independent of litigation.

6) Exclusions/disqualifiers
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. Mere historical “toxin” exposure (lead, FASD) is not a license for intoxicated violence.
- Primary psychosis/mania (unless the theory is a different excuse), acute TBI at the scene, or strong instrumental motives.
- Malingering safeguards must be built in: multiple validity indices, consistency across sessions, and collateral informants.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, and incarceration stress can depress executive performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions and look for replication or cross‑source corroboration; pre‑offense records are the best antidote.
- Reverse causation and “forensic artifact”: avoid over‑weighting post‑charge findings; insist on pre‑charge documentation for the core story.
- Over‑interpretation of sexy biomarkers: fMRI/EEG are not ready as dispositive evidence in individual cases; admit only, if at all, as background science with appropriate limiting instructions.
- Test bias and equity: require performance validity and culturally appropriate norms; ensure indigent defendants have resources for competent testing or the doctrine will skew.

How to operationalize this in court without losing the plot

- Narrow offense domain: limit the excuse to genuinely reactive violent offenses; do not extend to planned acquisitive crime. Maintain MPC‑style EED as the vehicle for homicide mitigation; reserve this dyscontrol/automatism excuse for the small “reflexive assault” slice.
- Burden and standard: defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of offense and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Gatekeeping: require a pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer tied to enumerated elements; appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; use standardized templates for documentary proof (school, medical, CPS, housing/EPA, unemployment records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Jury instructions: bifurcate; if the defense survives the gate, give a focused instruction keyed to “fair opportunity to conform” (Hart) and to the specific elements above; instruct that poverty alone is not a defense; voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse; and that scientific tests are supportive only if consistent with the event signature and pre‑offense history.
- Disposition: when the excuse is found, prefer ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused care, stable housing, nutrition/sleep interventions, removal from criminogenic contexts); reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. If the excuse fails, the same record should be available for structured sentencing mitigation.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 skeleton is directionally sound; Dr. Chen has supplied the right cautions. To keep this governable and legitimate, we need all five pillars above to align, tight offense limits, clear disqualifiers, and robust gatekeeping. Done that way, the doctrine will reach a rare class of cases where, in Hart’s terms, there was no fair opportunity to comply—without inviting the floodgates or slighting victims.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming the Santiago/Chen five‑pillar gate survives a pretrial Daubert hearing, what would your jury instruction and verdict form look like to keep the fact‑finder tightly focused? Please propose concrete language defining (i) “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and (ii) “substantial contributing cause,” and say whether you’d use bifurcation or special interrogatories to avoid a free‑ranging mini‑trial on background harms while preserving public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m largely in accord with Dr. Chen: no single lab value or task “time‑stamps” loss of control. If we are to let Stage 2 carry clear‑and‑convincing weight, the law should demand alignment across mechanism, history, and the moment, and cabin this to truly reactive violence. Here is how I’d structure it for courts.

1) What these tools can and cannot do
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal, Go/No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) index trait‑level inhibitory control with some state noise; they do not prove momentary dyscontrol. WCST is least probative for inhibition.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic BLLs speak to chronic load or developmental insult; they support plausibility, not the instant state.
- Psychiatric diagnoses (PTSD—especially dissociative subtype, IED) can bridge exposures to symptoms, but require pre‑offense anchoring to avoid “forensic artifact.”
- fMRI/EEG are not sufficiently specific or forensically mature to establish volitional failure at T0; admit only, if at all, as peripheral corroboration.

2) Minimum convergence I would require (clear and convincing)
You need all of the following; any single missing piece should presumptively defeat the excuse.

A. Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Acute provocation with near‑immediate escalation (seconds to a few minutes), disorganized execution, no luring or staging, no concealment plan; contemporaneous descriptions of “blanking out/seeing red,” autonomic arousal. Video/911/body‑cam is gold; credible eyewitnesses otherwise.
- A material delay, travel to arm oneself, or post‑event instrumental steps should presumptively bar the excuse.

B. Pre‑offense documentary history of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound explosions/dissociation (school discipline/IEPs, juvenile mental health, ED visits), and sleep disruption consistent with poor regulation. This addresses temporality and avoids reverse‑causation.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity and specificity
- At least two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below age‑ and education‑adjusted norms (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal; antisaccade error rate; affective Go/No‑Go), with intact effort on multiple performance‑validity tests and cross‑session stability or cross‑test convergence.
- Global cognitive impairment (low IQ/memory) cannot be the whole story; the profile should be relatively selective to control/affect regulation.
- Low–moderate psychopathy/antisocial trait scores consistent with impulsive (not predatory) aggression.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps the trigger
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD with dissociation, IED) by a qualified clinician, symptom content plausibly tied to the index trigger; corroborated by pre‑offense treatment or collateral accounts. Chronic stress biology (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one developmental insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or one ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), aligned with current inhibitory deficits.

F. Exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse; if substances were present, there must be persuasive evidence of baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania not traceable to RSB, acute TBI at offense, or clear instrumental motives.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs, consistency across time, collateral verification.
- Testing as early as feasible (within 30–60 days) plus reliance on pre‑offense records to reduce incarceration‑related confounds.

3) Scientific and forensic pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, or legal stress can depress task performance and cortisol; standardize testing conditions and, where possible, repeat.
- Base‑rate and ecological fallacy: Many high‑adversity defendants will have some deficits; do not leap from group correlations to individual causation without the event‑level signature and pre‑offense history.
- Reference norms and cultural bias: Use demographically corrected norms; be alert to stereotype threat and language/education effects masquerading as “inhibition.”
- Malingering/secondary gain: “Too bad to be true” or selective failures on easy tasks; require validity indices and collateral records.
- Acute intoxication and mixed causation: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; absent rare, nonvolitional ingestion, voluntary use should block the excuse.
- Reverse causation: Post‑offense incarceration can flatten cortisol and disturb sleep; hair cortisol can give a pre‑offense window, but chain of custody and confounders (hair treatments) matter.

4) Procedural guardrails to keep the gate tight and legitimate
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer tied to these elements; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology/psychiatry/environmental health.
- Limit the domain to genuinely reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on two linked propositions: (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time of offense; and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause.
- Expert scope: no ultimate‑issue pronouncements on “legal volition”; opinions must be couched in functional terms (e.g., “marked impairment of inhibitory control consistent with reactive dyscontrol under acute provocation”).

In short, the batteries and biomarkers are useful only as part of a convergent package. The law’s fairness limit (Hart) can be honored without floodgates if we insist on the event‑signature, pre‑offense history, specific inhibitory deficits with validity checks, a developmental insult consistent with mechanism, and tight exclusions for intoxication and planning.

---

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, how would you structure the court’s gatekeeping for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse in light of Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 bundle and Dr. Chen’s cautions? Please be concrete: (i) what should a Daubert/Frye pretrial checklist require (which tests/markers admissible, which to disallow or down‑weight, baseline disqualifiers like voluntary intoxication); (ii) what minimum showing must the defense make before the jury hears any of it (burden, offense typology limits, corroboration); and (iii) the core elements of a model jury instruction you’d give if the gate is passed. Aim for a pragmatic template a trial judge could actually use.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s framework gets the structure right: no single study or metric time‑stamps loss of control; the law will have to insist on convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment. Dr. Chen’s cautions about specificity and timing are on point. From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, here is how I would tighten Stage 2 and what I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard.

1) What these tools can and cannot do
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (with valid SSRT) and antisaccade are the most probative for inhibitory control; an affective variant (emotional Go–No‑Go) adds relevance. Stroop and WCST are low‑specificity supports, not anchors.
- Biomarkers: childhood blood lead levels (BLLs) in sensitive windows are probative of developmental insult; hair/diurnal cortisol is, at best, corroborative of chronic stress and too noisy to bear much weight. Functional imaging should be excluded for adjudicative purposes; it is not ready for individual attribution.
- Bottom line: none of these measures proves “loss of control at time t,” but a disciplined bundle can justify an inference of substantial volitional impairment in a narrow class of reactive cases.

2) Minimum bundle to satisfy clear and convincing
All five pillars must be present; any one alone is insufficient. The absence of any pillar defeats the excuse.

A. Event‑level signature (must have all)
- Rapid, stimulus‑bound escalation (seconds to a few minutes after a salient provocation), with disorganized execution and no evidence of planning, weapon staging, luring, concealment, or post‑event instrumental conduct.
- Contemporaneous evidence (video/bodycam/911/witness) of marked autonomic arousal and/or dissociation (“went blank/seeing red”), with brief post‑event confusion or amnesia (supportive, not determinative).

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (nonforensic, predating charge; must have at least one robust source)
- School/juvenile records (IEPs, discipline) or clinical notes documenting episodic explosive reactivity, dissociation, or impulse dyscontrol; or prior ED visits/arrests with similar reactive patterns.
- This addresses temporality and mitigates the “forensic artifact” problem.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity (must have both)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT and antisaccade; or SSRT and affective Go–No‑Go), administered with standardized conditions and repeated or cross‑validated if feasible.
- Multiple performance validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) passed; stability or cross‑task convergence demonstrated. Consider delay discounting as supportive.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event (must have)
- Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index offense. Low–moderate psychopathic traits (e.g., PCL‑R below moderate) support an impulsive, not predatory, profile.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism (must have at least one)
- Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or any ≥10); or well‑documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition during key developmental periods; or credible FASD risk. These must predate and plausibly relate to current executive deficits. Environmental orders (HUD/EPA lead hazards), WIC/clinic records, or geocoded histories corroborate.

Required exclusions/disqualifiers
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI contemporaneous with offense; malingering (failed PVTs); strong instrumental motive; or substantial planning—any of these should defeat the excuse.
- Timing: testing conducted promptly (ideally within 30–60 days) and interpreted alongside pre‑offense records to avoid reverse‑causation from post‑charge stress.

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and legal stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol; standardize testing conditions and, where possible, repeat or corroborate with pre‑offense records/actigraphy.
- Malingering/secondary gain: use multiple validity indices; be wary of “too bad to be true” or selective deficits.
- Reverse causation: prefer historical lab/education/medical records; treat hair/diurnal cortisol cautiously.
- Over‑interpreting low‑specificity tests: downweight Stroop/WCST; exclude fMRI/EEG for attribution.
- Acute intoxication: separate developmental “toxin” history (lead, FASD) from voluntary substance effects at the event.

4) Procedural and instructional safeguards (to keep the gate narrow and legitimate)
- Notice and a pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and, in rare instances, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively inapplicable to planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Bifurcation with a special verdict: require jurors to answer written interrogatories on each pillar (event signature; pre‑offense history; neurocognitive deficits with validity; psychiatric linkage; developmental insult; exclusions). Sample instruction: “You must find that, because of cumulative environmental deprivation and its biological/psychological effects, the defendant, at the moment of the act, lacked substantial capacity to inhibit an otherwise unlawful response to an acute provocation.”

5) Scope and disposition
- Keep this within my preferred narrow lanes: (a) involuntary‑rage/automatism‑like episodes; (b) homicide mitigation under MPC extreme emotional disturbance, not full excuse; (c) otherwise, RSB at sentencing with validated indicators.
- If excused, use ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions with supervision; reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

With these guardrails, the evidentiary bundle Santiago proposes—refined as Chen suggests—can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a very small slice of cases. The alternative—loosening specificity or temporality—would raise intolerable error costs and invite the very floodgates and legitimacy problems we should avoid.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming we adopt a narrow reactive‑dyscontrol excuse with a clear‑and‑convincing burden and disqualifiers (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, evidence of planning), please draft the core of a model jury instruction—two or three concise paragraphs—that explains (i) the elements the defense must prove (substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of offense caused in significant part by documented environmental deprivation) and (ii) what does not suffice (mere hardship, anger, or poor choices). If you think special interrogatories on the verdict form would reduce error, propose two focused questions the jury should answer yes/no. Keep it administrable and resistant to sympathy spillover.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Two points up front. First, I’m sympathetic to Prof. Santiago’s two‑gate approach, but courts will need an even tighter, administrable scaffold. Second, I agree with Dr. Chen: no single assay proves momentary loss of control; only a convergent, pre‑specified bundle should ever reach a jury.

What I would require under a clear‑and‑convincing standard

A. Offense signature and temporal nexus
- Reactive, affective violence following a salient, contemporaneous provocation; escalation within minutes, not hours.
- Disorganized execution; no luring, staging, retrieval of a weapon after a cooling interval, or concealment/flight suggestive of planning.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam, witness statements) of “seeing red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal.
Bright‑line exclusion: planned or instrumental offenses, including most acquisitive crimes and retaliatory attacks after a meaningful pause.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the incident (school discipline/IEPs, juvenile MH notes, ED visits) evidencing episodic explosive reactivity, dissociation, or impulse‑control failure.
- This guards against reverse‑causation artifacts from post‑charge testing.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibitory/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal/SSRT, Go–No‑Go/antisaccade, affective Stroop or emotional Go–No‑Go), with intact performance‑validity indices (embedded and stand‑alone) and cross‑task convergence.
- Low to moderate psychopathy/antisocial trait measures to support a reactive, not predatory, profile.
Judicial note: WCST is low‑specificity; downweight. fMRI is inadmissible or strictly limited under Rule 403—the “seductive image” problem outweighs marginal probative value.

D. Psychiatric linkage keyed to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician; symptom triggers plausibly map to the incident; corroborated by longitudinal records.
- Stress physiology may be admitted as supportive only (e.g., hair cortisol flattening); single‑day salivary profiles carry little weight.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one: repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably with a peak ≥10), HUD/EPA lead orders; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑supported FASD risk; or verified chronic sleep disruption from environmental stressors (with collateral evidence).
- Show dose–response: higher exposures correlate with the measured inhibitory deficits.

F. Exclusions/alternative causes ruled out
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the event, malingering (failed PVTs), or clear instrumental motive—each is disqualifying.
- Standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine) and, where possible, repeat to reduce state–trait confounds.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and fairness)

- Notice and structured proffer: Defense must file an RSB‑dyscontrol notice with a checklist tied to the elements above, plus geocoded exposure histories and underlying records (school/CPS/medical/EPA/UI).
- Daubert/Kumho hearing: Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; require raw data, PVT results, and methods transparency.
- Offense domain: Presumptively confined to reactive violent offenses; exceptional, truly impulsive nonviolent events only with heightened showings.
- Burden: Clear and convincing evidence that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Jury instructions: Emphasize this is not a “poverty defense.” It is a narrow excuse for momentary loss of inhibitory control; voluntary intoxication defeats it; the State’s right to rebut with contrary experts is preserved.
- Resource parity: If the jurisdiction cannot fund indigent defendants to meet these thresholds, the doctrine risks inequitable application.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police (echoing Dr. Chen)

- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, incarceration stress) and reverse causation—lean on pre‑offense records; prefer hair cortisol over single‑day saliva; be cautious with any “after the fact” deficits.
- Malingering—multiple PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral informants.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers—treat cortisol, HRV, and the like as corroboration, not determinative; exclude glossy neuroimages absent exceptional validation.
- Intoxication—keep the doctrinal line clear: voluntary substance‑induced dyscontrol is not excused.

Disposition if excuse succeeds

- Verdict form: “Not guilty by reason of dyscontrol due to severe environmental deprivation.”
- Immediate risk assessment; ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment pipelines) under judicial supervision; civil commitment only where statutory dangerousness is met.

Fallback avenues (when the gate is not met)

- MPC §210.3 extreme emotional disturbance to mitigate homicide to manslaughter, with tailored “person in the actor’s situation” instructions.
- Sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/biological indicators, with problem‑solving/ESB conditions.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 architecture is directionally right; Dr. Chen’s cautions are scientifically sound. To keep this both morally honest and institutionally governable, the court must insist on convergence across offense signature, pre‑offense history, valid neurocognitive deficits, documented developmental insults, and exclusion of alternatives—presented through a disciplined, pretrial gate with neutral expertise and tight jury instructions.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage screen and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as the working template, what concrete pretrial gatekeeping protocol would you adopt to operationalize a dyscontrol excuse without derailing trials—i.e., what would a Daubert-style admissibility order look like (required documents/tests, neutral experts, timelines, exclusion of intoxication), and what single, tight model jury instruction would you give if the case clears the gate to prevent the evidence from morphing into broad character mitigation or a backdoor justification?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 framework is broadly on the right track, but courts should tighten it to what the science can fairly support and what juries can administer. No single test or biomarker time‑stamps volitional failure; the law must demand convergence plus a credible moment‑of‑offense signature. I would require a clear‑and‑convincing showing on all five of the following, with explicit disqualifiers:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Acute trigger with seconds–minutes latency; no luring or staging; disorganized conduct; contemporaneous observations of dissociation (“went blank,” “seeing red”), autonomic arousal, or post‑event confusion. Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/bodycam, neighbor/witness statements).
- Presumptive bar if evidence shows planning (weapon fetched from another location, waiting for victim, concealment/flight consistent with instrumental aims).

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, juvenile or ED notes for dissociation/IED‑like episodes, sleep disruption). This is the best antidote to reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact” problems.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity and mechanism match
- At least two inhibitory/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD impaired with intact performance validity (embedded and stand‑alone): prioritize stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (SSRT), antisaccade, and an affective inhibition task (emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop). WCST/set‑shifting is low‑specificity and should be down‑weighted.
- Cross‑session stability or cross‑test convergence; include a delay‑discounting measure if available.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (not predatory) aggression; if used, PCL‑R should be modestly weighted and cautiously interpreted.

4) Psychiatric link that maps onto the index event
- Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored in pre‑offense exposures, with symptom triggers that plausibly explain the instant escalation. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., hair/diurnal cortisol) can be supportive but is neither necessary nor sufficient.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Independent (pre‑litigation) evidence of at least one biological insult plausibly affecting prefrontal/affect control (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or one ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), with temporality aligning to sensitive periods.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse (short of recognized involuntary intoxication).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the offense, or strong instrumental motives defeat the claim.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple performance‑validity tests, consistency across sessions, collateral informants.
- Standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine), and, where feasible, repeat key tasks; lean heavily on pre‑offense records.

On the proposed tools
- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the most probative; Stroop only as part of a bundle; WCST adds little to inhibition.
- Hair cortisol is a coarse, chronic‑load index with ethnic/hair‑treatment confounds; admissible only as supportive under Rule 702/Daubert, not dispositive. fMRI should rarely be admitted; risk of prejudice and overclaiming outweighs probative value in most cases (Rule 403).

Judicial gatekeeping/administrability
- Pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing with a structured proffer tied to the five pillars; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health to reduce partisanship.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.
- Limit doctrine to genuinely reactive violent offenses (and only exceptionally to truly impulsive nonviolent acts). Planned acquisitive or retaliatory crimes are out.
- Require notice and standardized documentation (medical labs, school/CPS, housing/EPA, geocoded history). Testing should occur promptly (ideally within 30–60 days) with performance validity built in.

Key scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication effects can depress performance and flatten cortisol—standardize and corroborate with pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: use multiple validity measures; beware selective or “too bad to be true” impairment.
- Acute intoxication: distinguish developmental toxins (lead) from alcohol/stimulant effects at the offense.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge stress can mimic chronic stress profiles—pre‑charge records are paramount.
- Norms/measurement bias: ensure tests and norms are appropriate for the defendant’s language/education/culture to avoid spurious deficits.

Disposition and jury management
- If the excuse is found, channel to a separate ESB‑focused disposition hearing (supervised trauma treatment, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines), with civil commitment available only if legally dangerous and mentally ill.
- Use bifurcation and a tailored instruction: poverty or hardship alone is not a defense; you may consider RSB only insofar as it bears on whether the defendant acted automatically or lacked substantial capacity to conform in the moment.

Bottom line
The minimum “bundle” above, coupled with tight exclusions and neutral expertise, can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a small subset of cases. Anything looser risks overclaiming, jury confusion, and floodgates. This keeps the doctrine aligned with Hart’s fairness limit and preserves institutional legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing both your evidence and administrability hats, do Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle clear a Rule 702/Daubert threshold in your view, and can they be translated into a workable pretrial screen and jury instruction? Please be concrete: (i) what should a Daubert order require (e.g., specified tests, validity indices, timing, neutral experts) to minimize state–trait confounds, malingering, and intoxication artifacts; (ii) would you confine the excuse to reactive violent offenses with no advance weapon staging; and (iii) draft the core of a model jury instruction defining “substantial volitional impairment” and the clear‑and‑convincing causation link, so we don’t smuggle mitigation into guilt. If you would prune or add any elements to the bundle, say which and why.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’ll translate Dr. Chen’s careful science into an administrable courtroom gate. The touchstone, per Hart, is fair opportunity to comply. Stage 2 should answer a legal question: did the defendant’s inhibitory control fail to such a degree, at the charged moment, that we cannot fairly attribute the act to him? Because no single test can time‑stamp control loss, courts should demand convergence across independent strands, screened in a Rule 702/Daubert hearing, and limited to reactive violence.

1) Domain and burden
- Offense domain: limit to reactive, affective violence (assaultive offenses and homicide without apparent planning). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime and cases with weapon staging, luring, or concealment conduct.
- Voluntary intoxication: a disqualifier where it is a substantial proximate driver.
- Burden: clear and convincing evidence; defense bears it as an affirmative excuse.
- Procedure: early, structured proffer; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); standardized documentary templates; reciprocal discovery; written Daubert findings.

2) Minimum bundle required (no single element suffices)
I would require five pillars; at least four must be satisfied, and the first and second are mandatory:

A. Event signature (mandatory)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized, impulsive execution; contemporaneous observations of dissociation/“saw red”/marked autonomic arousal; absence of luring, weapon staging, or cover‑up. Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam audio).

B. Pre‑offense documentation (mandatory)
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile/ED notes of dissociation/intermittent explosive episodes; sleep disruption; prior incidents of sudden rage. This addresses temporality and combats reverse‑causation.

C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests intact and reasonable stability across sessions. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting). Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy scores to support a reactive, not predatory, profile.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis consistent with reactive dyscontrol (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored in pre‑offense exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the index trigger/dissociation. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented developmental insult (e.g., childhood blood‑lead ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or one ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), plus the Stage‑1 deprivation profile. The biomarker should plausibly relate to current executive deficits.

3) Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls
- Voluntary intoxication/substances as proximate drivers.
- Primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI at offense unless separately excused.
- Malingering: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures, cross‑source consistency, and beware “too bad to be true” cognitive profiles.
- Instrumental motive/planning indicators.
- Acute state noise: standardize sleep/medication/caffeine; consider repeat testing; prefer pre‑offense records.

4) Evidentiary cautions (the pitfalls)
- State–trait confounds: Executive tests and cortisol are state‑sensitive; mitigate with repeat/confirmatory testing and pre‑offense documentation. Hair cortisol (3‑month window) is more informative than single‑day salivary profiles but has its own confounds.
- Reverse causation: Post‑charge stress and incarceration depress performance and flatten cortisol; anchor opinions in pre‑charge history.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: neighborhood and school deprivation are necessary context, not proof of dyscontrol in this defendant without the individualized showing above.
- Over‑interpretation of neuroimaging: fMRI/EEG lack individual‑level, offense‑moment specificity; admit, if at all, only as limited corroboration under 403/702.
- Equity/administrability: guard against disparate application by resourcing indigent defendants for expert work and by using court‑appointed neutrals; keep mini‑trials in check with time limits and focused instructions.

5) Jury guidance
- Bifurcate where feasible. If the court admits the excuse, instruct that:
  - Substantial impairment means the defendant’s capacity to conform to law was significantly degraded so as to remove a fair opportunity to comply at the charged moment.
  - Poverty or adversity alone is insufficient; the impairment must be causally connected to the event, as shown by the admitted evidence.
  - Voluntary intoxication cannot supply the excuse.
- For homicide, reserve the alternative EED instruction (MPC §210.3) where the evidence supports severe disturbance but not full dyscontrol.

6) Disposition if excuse is found
- Noncarceral ESB conditions tailored to the demonstrated mechanisms (trauma‑focused therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, lead mitigation/housing relocation, job pipelines), with risk‑based supervision. Civil commitment remains available where mental illness renders the defendant dangerous.

Bottom line
Dr. Chen is right that no instrument timestamps loss of control. But if courts demand the mandatory event signature plus pre‑offense documentation, and then require neurocognitive deficits with validity, a plausible psychiatric link, and at least one objective developmental insult, all while excluding intoxication and planning, the inference that fair opportunity was absent will be clear and convincing in a narrow band of cases. That is the proper, rule‑governed channel: narrow enough to avoid floodgates, principled enough to preserve legitimacy, and responsive to cases where blame would be misplaced.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution as givens, could you lay out an administrable courtroom framework? Specifically: (1) what should a pretrial gatekeeping order look like (standard of proof at the hearing, neutral expert appointment, and exclusion grounds), and (2) what core jury instruction would you give if the defense passes the gate—defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control,” distinguishing it from insanity and from voluntary intoxication, allocating burdens (clear and convincing for the excuse?), and limiting the doctrine to reactive violence? Please be concrete—sample language and any bifurcation you’d require.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I share Prof. Santiago’s and Dr. Chen’s core instincts: none of these tools can time‑stamp volitional failure; they can, at best, support a highly constrained inference when history, mechanism, and the moment align. From an evidentiary/administrability standpoint, I would:

1) Confine the doctrine and set the burden
- Offense domain: reactive interpersonal violence with a salient, near‑immediate provocation; presumptive exclusion for planned acquisitive crime and for cases with staging/cover‑up.
- Disqualifiers: substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver; clear instrumental motive; malingering; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures.
- Burden/standard: defendant bears clear‑and‑convincing proof that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded (Hart’s “no fair opportunity” limit) and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.

2) Gatekeeping and process
- Pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing tied to pre‑specified elements; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; standardized proffer (geocoded exposure history; medical/CPS/school/lead/housing records).
- Jury management: bifurcation where feasible; a focused instruction that this is an excuse (loss of control), not a justification; special verdict form if found.

3) Sufficiency: a minimum converging bundle (all required)
- Event signature: credible evidence of an affective, rapidly escalating confrontation; disorganized execution; contemporaneous reports (911/body‑cam/witness) of “blanking out,” autonomic arousal; no luring, staging, or concealment.
- Pre‑offense documentation: nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, prior ED or clinic notes, sleep disruption tied to environment).
- Neurocognitive deficits with validity: at least two inhibitory/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Stroop/Go–No‑Go) ≥1.5 SD below norms, with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and cross‑session/cross‑test consistency; low‑to‑moderate psychopathic trait profile.
- Objective developmental insult: independently documented exposure plausibly linked to prefrontal/affect regulation (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, ideally repeated or ≥10 once; FASD risk; clinically verified early malnutrition/IDA; verified lead‑hazard housing order) that predates and helps explain current deficits.
- Psychiatric linkage: a structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptoms and triggers plausibly map onto the index event; biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) are supportive but not required.

4) What is not enough
- Group‑level correlations (poverty, high‑crime tract) without individual documentation.
- Single neurotest failure, WCST alone, or generic Stroop without inhibition‑specific tasks.
- Post‑charge records only, absent pre‑offense corroboration (risk of “forensic artifact”).
- Stand‑alone fMRI/EEG. Admit only, if at all, as demonstrative; they do not meet the specificity/temporal precision Daubert contemplates for causation.

5) Pitfalls courts must police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol; standardize testing; repeat or corroborate; prefer hair cortisol over single‑day saliva; document sleep (actigraphy/collateral).
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple embedded/stand‑alone PVTs; watch for selective “too bad to be true” profiles; require stability across sessions.
- Acute intoxication: separate chronic toxin history (lead, FASD) from alcohol/drug effects at the scene; voluntary intoxication should generally defeat the excuse.
- Reverse causation/base‑rate error: do not infer from adversity to excusal; require temporality via pre‑offense records; avoid ecological fallacies (group data to individual).
- Norms/validity: ensure tests use appropriate demographic norms; labs for hair cortisol/lead must be accredited; report error rates and confidence intervals.

Bottom line on Santiago’s Stage 2: the proposed battery and markers are not, individually, specific or temporally sensitive enough to carry the day. As a convergent bundle—anchored by the event’s reactive signature and pre‑offense documentation, plus valid inhibitory deficits and at least one objective developmental insult—they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a small subset of cases. That is the administrable sweet spot. Outside that narrow lane, the proper home for RSB evidence is structured mitigation at sentencing (with verified indicators such as documented lead exposure, chronic unemployment, housing code violations), not a guilt‑stage excuse.

---

### Speaker: Host

Taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as givens, if you were drafting a model rule and jury instruction for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse, what precise language and procedural steps would you prescribe to make it trial‑manageable and appeal‑resistant? Please specify: (i) a pretrial Daubert checklist (what must be in the proffer and from whom), (ii) any offense‑type limitation, (iii) allocation and level of proof, and (iv) a short-form instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause,” with guidance on how jurors should weigh planning evidence, intoxication, and neutral‑expert testimony. Keep it concrete enough that a trial judge could implement it next term.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

Bottom line. I would admit Stage 2 evidence only as a convergent bundle, never piecemeal; require a tight offense domain (reactive violence), a clear-and-convincing burden on the defense, and a robust Daubert/Rule 702 gate with court‑appointed neutral experts. Properly cabined, the proposed batteries and markers can support an inference of substantial volitional impairment at the moment of offense, but none is specific or temporally precise standing alone.

On the proposed tools

- Neurocognitive tasks
  - Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go (with well‑estimated SSRT) are the most on‑point for inhibitory control and generally satisfy Daubert on testing and peer review. They are state‑sensitive; I would require standardized administration, performance‑validity tests, and (where feasible) re‑testing for stability.
  - Stroop (classic) is nonspecific; it belongs in a battery but should be down‑weighted. An affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop variant is more probative in rage cases.
  - WCST measures set‑shifting; it adds little to the dyscontrol question and should carry minimal weight.
  - Add an antisaccade task or flanker as a second inhibition assay, and a delay‑discounting measure for impulsive choice.
  - Always include multiple validity checks (embedded and stand‑alone) and document effort.

- Stress/exposure markers
  - Childhood blood lead levels (BLLs) are probative of developmental insult if obtained during sensitive windows and documented independently of litigation; they strengthen plausibility when paired with current executive deficits.
  - Hair cortisol (3‑cm segment) can index chronic stress over several months; treat as supportive only. Single‑day salivary diurnal profiles are noisy and should be used cautiously.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition records are supportive but not specific.
  - I would not admit fMRI to prove event‑level loss of control; the risk of over‑interpretation and prejudice outweighs probative value. EEG has limited utility here.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing

Require all five pillars below; any missing element defeats the excuse. In addition, apply the disqualifiers that follow.

1) Reactive event signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/preparation/cover‑up. Prefer corroboration from video/911 audio/body‑worn camera or multiple witnesses. Post‑event “went blank/seeing red” reports support but do not suffice.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, prior ED/clinic notes of dissociation/IED, documented chronic sleep disruption).

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go), with intact performance‑validity indices and either test–retest stability or cross‑task convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with reactive (not predatory) aggression; if used, PCL‑R should be low to moderate and interpreted cautiously given its controversies.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician of PTSD (including dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures and with symptom triggers that plausibly explain the index event. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated, a ≥10 µg/dL single measure, early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or well‑documented FASD risk) that temporally precedes and plausibly contributes to the current executive deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls

- Substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute effects.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple performance‑validity tests, consistency across sessions, and collateral informants; “too bad to be true” patterns fail.
- Alternative causes: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time of offense, and clear instrumental motives.
- Timing: testing should occur as early as feasible (preferably within 60–90 days post‑offense) and be corroborated by pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact” effects.

Scientific pitfalls the court should watch for

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and legal stress can depress performance and alter cortisol. Standardize test conditions and lean on pre‑offense records; consider actigraphy or other sleep documentation where sleep is central.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and impair cognition. Hair cortisol helps with pre‑offense windows; pre‑charge school/medical data are strongest.
- Base‑rate and ecological fallacies: population links (e.g., lead–crime) do not prove case‑level causation; insist on the within‑person, temporally ordered nexus above.
- Adversarial shopping: appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; require disclosure of all testing and raw data.
- Overuse of prejudicial instruments: be cautious with PCL‑R (potential bias) and bar neuroimages as “pictures that persuade” absent clear incremental validity.

Procedural guardrails

- Pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing tied to a structured proffer addressing each pillar and the disqualifiers; defense bears the clear‑and‑convincing burden.
- Offense limitation: presumptively available only for affective/reactive violent offenses; exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Jury instruction (if the gate is passed): explain that background alone is not a defense; the question is whether inhibitory control was substantially degraded and whether that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act; voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse.
- Resource parity: fund indigent defendants to meet these thresholds; otherwise the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

Placement and error costs

Given public‑legitimacy and victim‑protection concerns, I would rather risk some false negatives than false positives. Cases failing to meet this bundle should be channeled to sentencing mitigation, where the same evidence (especially exposure biomarkers and longitudinal records) properly bears on diminished blameworthiness and ESB‑oriented conditions. With these guardrails, successful Stage‑2 attributions should remain rare and confined to the top tail of cumulative adversity where mechanism, history, and moment align.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, building on Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, could you set out (i) a concrete pretrial gatekeeping standard for admissibility (burden, scope, and disqualifiers) and (ii) a short model jury instruction for a dyscontrol-based RSB excuse? Please specify: clear-and-convincing vs preponderance; which offenses are eligible; required elements of convergence (event signature, pre-offense history, neurocognitive deficits with validity checks, and at least one objective exposure biomarker); bright-line disqualifiers (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, evidence of planning); and the judge–jury allocation (what the court finds at a Daubert-style hearing, what the jury must decide). Keep it tight and administrable.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally sound. As a trial judge, I would translate it into a tight, Daubert‑policed framework that (i) anchors any inference in the event signature, (ii) demands pre‑offense documentation, and (iii) treats lab findings as corroboration, not time‑stamps of loss of control. No single tool is specific or temporally precise enough; only convergence can meet a clear‑and‑convincing burden.

What is probative and how to weigh it

- Central pillar: event‑level phenomenology
  - Necessaries: rapid escalation after salient provocation; minimal planning; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions of “seeing red”/dissociation; immediate post‑event confusion. Prefer independent corroboration (video, 911 audio, body‑cam, multiple witnesses).
  - Disqualifiers: luring, weapon staging, concealment, post‑offense instrumental conduct. Absent a reactive signature, the defense should not go to the jury.

- Neurocognitive testing (supportive, not dispositive)
  - Useful: Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (SSRT), antisaccade, flanker; include an affective variant (emotional Go–No‑Go/Stroop). Require ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks with intact performance‑validity indices and either test–retest stability or cross‑test convergence.
  - Downweight: WCST (set‑shifting) as nonspecific. Use Stroop as part of a battery only.
  - Guardrails: standardized testing conditions (sleep, meds), multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; no “one‑off” results created solely for litigation.

- Psychiatric linkage
  - Acceptable: structured diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptoms and triggers mapping plausibly onto the index event; corroborate with nonforensic, pre‑offense records (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile treatment notes).
  - Trait profile: low–moderate psychopathic traits supports a reactive—not predatory—picture; use cautiously.

- Exposure/physiology corroboration
  - Historic BLLs (preferably repeated ≥5 µg/dL in early childhood, or any ≥10) strengthen plausibility when paired with inhibition deficits. Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition or documented FASD risk likewise supportive.
  - Stress markers: hair cortisol (3‑cm segment) more informative than single‑day salivary profiles; treat as chronic‑load corroboration, not timing proof. HRV/threat‑startle can support an affect‑regulation mechanism but are not necessary.

Minimum converging bundle to meet clear and convincing

Require all of the following:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol (as defined above), with independent corroboration where feasible.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of episodic, stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school/juvenile/medical/CPS records), not created post‑charge.

3) Neurocognitive evidence: ≥1.5 SD impairment on two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks, intact validity, and stability/convergence across sessions.

4) Clinical diagnosis mapping to the event, supported by structured instruments and collateral records.

5) At least one independently documented developmental biological insult (e.g., childhood lead, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, FASD risk) temporally predating the offense.

And all of the following exclusions:

- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects generally defeat the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; absent that, no instruction.
- Malingering: multiple PVT failures or “too bad to be true” patterns bar the defense.
- Alternative primary causes: acute psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, or clear instrumental motive.
- Timing artifact control: avoid relying on post‑incarceration stress indices; prioritize pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounding: acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and litigation stress degrade task performance and cortisol. Standardize conditions; prefer replication or corroboration.
- Reverse causation: incarceration can flatten cortisol; hair assays help but have hair‑treatment/ethnicity confounds and chain‑of‑custody issues.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: fMRI/EEG carry high 403 risks and limited incremental value; admit, if at all, only as modest corroboration with careful limiting instructions.
- PCL‑R misuse: avoid overreliance; risk of prejudice and contested validity outside high‑risk samples.
- Multiple comparisons/cherry‑picking: require full reporting of the battery, validity indices, and raw/standard scores; no selective presentation.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and equity)

- Pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing keyed to a structured proffer aligned with the five‑pillar bundle; appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and standardized templates for documentary proof (geocoded residence histories, EPA/HUD orders, pediatric labs, school/CPS/UI records).
- Limit the doctrine to truly reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden: clear and convincing on (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) substantial contribution to the instant act.
- Resource parity: courts must fund indigent defendants’ testing/experts; otherwise the doctrine is illusory and unequal.

Jury management

- Bifurcation and a tailored instruction: make clear this is not a justification or a referendum on social policy; it is a narrow excuse turning on whether, because of proven cumulative exposures and documented impairments, the defendant lacked substantial capacity to inhibit a sudden reactive assault.
- Verdict form: a distinct “not guilty by reason of dyscontrol” option tied to ESB‑oriented dispositions (trauma treatment, housing relocation, sleep/nutrition interventions, job pathways), with civil commitment available where ongoing dangerousness is clinically shown.

Bottom line

The batteries and markers, used alone, are insufficient; used together—anchored to the event and buttressed by pre‑offense records—they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of reactive dyscontrol in a small class of cases. Tight gatekeeping, neutral expertise, and a narrow offense domain protect administrability and public legitimacy while honoring Hart’s fairness limit.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming the court recognizes a narrow dyscontrol excuse, could you sketch a model jury instruction that operationalizes Dr. Chen’s convergence approach? Please specify: (a) the elements the defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence; (b) enumerated disqualifiers (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, planning, malingering); and (c) guidance to jurors on weighing conflicting expert testimony to avoid a mere “battle of the experts.” Would you deliver this in a bifurcated phase, and why?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I largely agree with Dr. Chen: no single instrument can “time‑stamp” loss of control. The law should admit Stage 2 evidence only as part of a convergent, pre‑offense‑anchored bundle, and only in reactive violence. The admissibility and sufficiency gates must do most of the work.

On the tools
- Inhibition tasks: Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (with reliable SSRT) and antisaccade are the most mechanism‑proximal. An affective variant (emotional Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop) is useful because many incidents are anger‑triggered. Classic Stroop and WCST are nonspecific; I would downweight or omit WCST.
- Stress markers: Historic blood lead (especially repeated elevations in early childhood) is probative of developmental insult but says nothing about the instant moment. Hair cortisol can support chronic load; single‑day salivary profiles are too noisy to carry weight. Treat all biomarkers as corroborative, not determinative.
- Clinical diagnosis: PTSD (dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder can help organize the story, but diagnosis alone should never satisfy the legal standard.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
Require all of A–C and at least one finding from D and E; failure of any disqualifier below defeats the excuse.

A) Event signature (must have)
- Rapid escalation after a salient provocation; no meaningful planning or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous indicators of autonomic arousal or dissociation (“saw red,” “blanked out”), preferably corroborated by video/911/body‑cam or neutral witnesses.

B) Pre‑offense documentation (must have)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity; prior ED or clinic notes; juvenile records). This shores up temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C) Neurocognitive profile with validity (must have)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact and multiple performance‑validity indices and stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Include a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if feasible. Low–moderate psychopathy traits (PCL‑R not elevated) support a reactive, not predatory, style but should be used cautiously.

D) Clinical linkage
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD with dissociation; IED) whose symptom triggers plausibly map onto the index event, anchored to exposures established at Stage 1.

E) Objective exposure biomarker
- At least one developmental insult documented independently of litigation (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to current inhibition deficits.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one defeats the claim)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver.
- Instrumental planning (luring, weapon staging, concealment) or clear goal‑directed motive inconsistent with reactive dyscontrol.
- Primary psychosis/mania better explaining the act (unless the defense is insanity, not RSB).
- Malingering/secondary gain: failed effort testing; “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles; litigation‑generated records without collateral corroboration.

Scientific pitfalls for courts (and how to manage)
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize test conditions; repeat key tests; lean on pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation: Obtain earliest feasible testing; prefer historical school/medical/environmental records; hair cortisol over single‑day saliva.
- Base‑rate neglect/ecological fallacy: Population links (lead, ACEs) do not prove individual causation; insist on the full bundle and event mapping.
- Test bias and p‑hacking: Use demographically appropriate norms; multiple validity checks; avoid over‑reliance on WCST/Stroop; treat fMRI/EEG as supportive, not diagnostic.
- PCL‑R misuse: Do not convert a low score into proof of dyscontrol; use only to exclude predatory profiles.

Administrability—judicial guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.
- Limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Require standardized documentary templates (school/CPS/medical lab/EPA‑HUD/ UI records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Ensure funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will be both under‑ and mis‑applied.

Jury instruction (sketch)
“The defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the act, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate, provoked response was substantially impaired, and that this impairment—arising from long‑term environmental exposures—was a substantial contributing cause of the act. A diagnosis, adversity alone, or ordinary anger is insufficient. If you find the act was planned or driven primarily by voluntary intoxication, you must reject the defense.”

Disposition
If established, I favor noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation away from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines), with civil commitment reserved for those who are mentally ill and dangerous under existing standards.

Bottom line
Santiago’s Stage 2 elements can support a legally adequate inference only when they converge and are anchored in pre‑offense records and event‑level features, with strict exclusions for intoxication and planning. With those constraints, the doctrine is morally defensible and institutionally governable.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming we adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution bundle, what precise pretrial procedure would you write to make this administrable and control error costs? Please specify a single, rule‑like framework: (i) what the defense must include in a structured proffer (documentary exhibits and test types you’d accept or exclude); (ii) how you’d use court‑appointed neutral experts and Daubert‑style reliability findings; (iii) the burden and standard (e.g., clear and convincing) at the hearing; and (iv) any categorical limits (offense types, intoxication bars) you’d bake in to avoid jury confusion and floodgates. Keep it as if you were drafting a local rule or model order.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I agree with Prof. Santiago’s premise that Stage 2 must carry the causal weight, and with Dr. Chen’s caution: none of the proposed tools time‑stamps volitional failure. If courts are to admit a dyscontrol excuse at guilt without eroding administrability and public confidence, Stage 2 should be narrow, rule‑governed, and anchored in event‑level corroboration, not just trait‑like deficits.

On the proposed instruments
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (with reliable SSRT) and an affective inhibition task (emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop) are the most probative. Traditional Stroop and WCST are weakly specific to inhibitory control and should be downweighted or omitted. Require multiple performance‑validity tests and, absent early testing, corroboration by pre‑offense records to reduce state noise.
- Stress/exposure markers: Historic childhood BLLs (with dates) and other developmental insults are probative of mechanism, not moment. Hair cortisol is preferable to single‑day salivary profiles for chronic load but is supportive only. I would exclude fMRI in the guilt phase; its reverse‑inference risks and prejudicial impact are high.

Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard
All of the following should be required; failure on any element defeats the excuse (reserving RSB for sentencing mitigation):

1) Event signature (reactive, not instrumental), corroborated
- Salient, external trigger; minimal latency (measured in seconds, not minutes); disorganized execution; no luring/preparation/concealment.
- Corroboration by neutral contemporaneous evidence (video/911/body‑cam or independent eyewitnesses). Mere post‑hoc self‑report (“saw red”) is insufficient.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes, ED visits, prior documented episodes). This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive and clinical convergence, with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and an affective inhibition task), with intact effort indices (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs) and either stability across two sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- A structured‑interview diagnosis that maps to the index behavior (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), tied to exposures established in Stage 1; symptom content plausibly explains the event.

4) Exposure‑mechanism anchor
- At least one independently documented developmental insult consistent with prefrontal/affect‑regulation compromise (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a ≥10 spike; FASD risk with corroboration; documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency), plus plausible linkage to current deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/disqualifiers
- Appreciable planning (weapon retrieval from another location, ambush), pursuit, or post‑event instrumental conduct.
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures (a different doctrine), acute TBI at the time, or malingering (failed PVTs, inconsistent profiles).
- High psychopathic trait profile suggesting predatory rather than reactive aggression.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, legal stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol; standardize testing conditions, prefer pre‑offense records, and consider limited retest.
- Base‑rate and reference‑class error: “seeing red” is common; without neutral corroboration it has low specificity.
- Cherry‑picking/p‑hacking: require pre‑specified test batteries, protocols, and reporting of all administered measures; avoid forensic “shopping.”
- Ecological fallacy: neighborhood‑level statistics cannot establish case‑level causation; Stage 2 must stand on individual evidence.
- Neurohype: exclude fMRI/advanced imaging as determinative; if admitted at all, it should be ancillary and carefully cabined.

Procedural guardrails
- Daubert‑style pretrial hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Bifurcation: guilt first; if reached, a discrete excuse phase with tailored instructions to avoid undue prejudice from Stage 1 background.
- Standardized proffers (geocoded exposure histories; dated lab/medical/school/CPS/EPA records) and uniform testing protocols to promote parity and reproducibility.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; limit the doctrine to reactive interpersonal violence (and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts), presumptively excluding planned acquisitive crime.

Jury instruction and verdict form
- Require specific findings on each element (event signature, pre‑offense dyscontrol, test‑based deficits with validity, exposure anchor, and absence of disqualifiers). A checkbox verdict form promotes discipline and appellate review.

Disposition
- If the excuse carries, move to an ESB‑oriented disposition hearing (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep remediation, employment supports) with risk‑management conditions; reserve civil commitment for those who remain dangerous. Otherwise, route the same evidence to structured mitigation at sentencing.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 architecture is directionally sound; Dr. Chen correctly tempers expectations about specificity and timing. Courts should adopt a bright‑line, conjunctive bundle that makes the defense rare and reviewable, with most RSB evidence doing its work at sentencing unless the case is a close analogue to automatism. This preserves Hart’s fairness limit while maintaining administrability and public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming we recognize a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the lines Prof. Santiago outlined and Dr. Chen refined, what concrete, textable architecture would you put in place to make it administrable and legitimate? Please sketch (i) a pretrial admissibility rule (the contents of the defense’s proffer and a Daubert-style hearing standard), and (ii) a short model jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and limiting it to reactive offenses. Keep it tight—what exact language and safeguards would you codify to avoid poverty-on-trial creep, preserve equality, and cabin error costs?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I’m largely in the same place as Dr. Chen on the science and I’ll translate that into judicial gates and error-cost controls.

1) Specificity and temporality of the proposed tools
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go): probative of trait‑level inhibitory weakness; not time‑stamps of loss of control at the moment. Useful only as part of a convergent package and only with multiple performance‑validity tests and, ideally, stability across sessions.
- Stroop and WCST: low mechanism specificity. I would not treat WCST as core evidence; Stroop can be supplemental.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol): speak to chronic load; noisy and subject to state confounds. Supportive, not dispositive.
- Historic blood lead (childhood BLLs): probative of developmental insult when elevations occurred during sensitive periods; again supportive.
Net: none of these, singly, proves substantial volitional impairment during the offense; together, aligned with event‑level evidence and pre‑offense documentation, they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow subset.

2) Minimum converging bundle (clear and convincing)
I would require all five pillars below, plus disqualifiers, before the jury ever hears it:

A. Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; seconds/minutes, not hours.
- Disorganized, non‑instrumental execution; no luring, staging, concealment, or clean‑up.
- Contemporaneous indicia (911/bodycam/witness): “went blank,” “saw red,” marked autonomic arousal, confusion. Video or audio corroboration carries special weight.

B. Pre‑offense history of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the incident (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile mental‑health notes; ED visits for rage/dissociation; sleep disruption records). This answers temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity and cross‑task convergence
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade error rate, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests passed.
- Prefer replication or cross‑task convergence within 4–6 weeks to reduce state noise (sleep, meds).
- Low–moderate psychopathy traits (e.g., PCL‑R not in the high range), consistent with impulsive rather than predatory aggression.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician; symptom triggers plausibly tied to the index event and to documented adversities.
- A chronic‑stress biomarker (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological adversity predating offense (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated—or a single ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk), ideally with a dose–response link to current inhibitory deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, collateral informants, internal consistency across sessions; courts should be alert to “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania/TBI as alternate drivers (unless proceeding under a different doctrine).
- Testing timing and standardization: conduct early (30–60 days), standardize sleep/meds/caffeine, and rely heavily on pre‑offense records to counter state–trait confounds.

3) Scientific pitfalls and judicial cautions
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, meds can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Prefer repeat testing and pre‑offense documentation.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge stress can create the very patterns offered as proof; hair cortisol (pre‑offense segment) and old pediatric/school labs/records help.
- Neuro‑washing: over‑interpreting fMRI/EEG or single biomarkers. I would admit such evidence, if at all, only as background mechanism education, not as case‑determinative proof.
- Task specificity: WCST and classic Stroop shouldn’t be given central weight; inhibition tasks with affective load are closer to the mechanism at issue.
- Selection effects: be wary of curated narratives that omit instrumental motives (feuds, retaliation) and of “culture shopping.”

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability and equity)
- Daubert‑style pretrial hearing keyed to a structured checklist (like the five pillars above), with the defense bearing a clear‑and‑convincing burden on substantial degradation of inhibitory control and on causal contribution to the act.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to review competing proffers.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (geocoded exposure histories; pediatric labs; CPS/school/housing/EPA/UI records).
- Offense limitation: presumptively limited to reactive interpersonal violence; exclude planned acquisitive crimes and weapons possession; gray areas resolved against admission absent strong event‑level corroboration.
- Jury instruction emphasizing Hart’s fairness limit (no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply) and warning that poverty or anger alone is not an excuse; the question is substantial loss of inhibitory capacity at the time, caused by documented RSB exposures.

5) Bottom line
Used this way, the Stage‑2 package can justify a tightly circumscribed dyscontrol excuse in rare cases. The most probative pieces for courts are (1) the event’s reactive, disorganized signature; (2) pre‑offense records of stimulus‑bound loss of control; and (3) valid, convergent inhibitory deficits that cohere with a documented developmental insult. Everything else is corroboration. With these gates and neutral expertise, we respect victims, keep the doctrine governable, and reserve exculpation for defendants who genuinely lacked a fair opportunity to comply.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume a jurisdiction adopts a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the lines Prof. Santiago and Dr. Chen sketched. Draft the core of a pattern jury instruction: what precise elements must the jury find (by clear and convincing evidence) to return an excuse verdict, and what categories of evidence are, as a matter of law, insufficient or inadmissible to prove the excuse? Please be concrete (e.g., reactive event signature, pre‑offense documentation, validated neurocognitive deficits, exclusion of voluntary intoxication), and keep the instruction tight enough to minimize mini‑trials on social background while preserving fairness.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally right, and Dr. Chen’s cautions are well taken. From an administrability and evidentiary standpoint, no single test or biomarker can carry the day; the law should demand tight convergence across domains that jointly speak to (a) mechanism, (b) timing, and (c) the character of the instant event. To make this governable and fair, I would:

1) Limit the domain
- Applicability: reactive, affective violence with minimal preplanning. Presumptive exclusion for instrumental/planned offenses and where voluntary intoxication is a substantial contributing cause.
- Burden: clear and convincing evidence that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Procedure: pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing (or state analog) with court‑appointed neutral experts; standardized proffer and discovery (testing reports, raw data, validity indices).

2) Require a minimum bundle of converging findings
The defense should meet all of A–C, plus at least two of D–F:

A. Event‑level signature (must have)
- Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; disorganized execution; lack of luring/staging/cover‑up; contemporaneous descriptions of “seeing red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal. Prefer contemporaneous corroboration (video/body‑cam/911 audio, neutral eyewitness).

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (must have)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity; prior ED/clinic notes for dissociation/IED; juvenile records). This supplies temporality and counters reverse‑causation.

C. Valid neurocognitive evidence of inhibition deficits (must have)
- At least two tasks primarily indexing inhibitory control/affect regulation (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT; antisaccade; affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), each ≥1.5 SD below norms; plus intact performance validity (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs). Replication across sessions or cross‑task convergence is strongly preferred. Downweight WCST; include, if available, a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting).

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured diagnostic workup (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to pre‑offense exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index event. Diagnosis is supportive but not sufficient standing alone.

E. Objective physiological/exposure corroboration
- Historic developmental insult consistent with the mechanism (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, ideally repeated—or ≥10 once; documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency; FASD risk), or chronic stress physiology (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) obtained with proper controls. Treat these as plausibility enhancers, not time‑stamps.

F. Trait profile consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression
- Low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits (cautiously interpreted); collateral reports describing impulsive/reactive temperament. This helps exclude a calculated motive.

3) Disqualifiers and controls the court should police
- Voluntary intoxication: where toxicology and circumstances indicate acute alcohol/drug effects are the proximate driver, the excuse should fail. If substances were present, the defense must establish baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple PVTs, consistency across sessions, and collateral verification. Be alert to “too bad to be true” patterns or selective failures.
- State–trait confounds: standardize test conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine); consider actigraphy or collateral sleep documentation; favor pre‑offense records to avoid post‑charge artifact.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance; hair cortisol should be anchored to pre‑offense growth segments where used; prioritize historic pediatric/school/CPS/EPA records.
- Over‑interpretation of high‑tech evidence: fMRI/EEG are not dispositive; admit, if at all, only as supportive within a convergent package and only under strict 702 controls.

4) Gatekeeping mechanics to keep the doctrine narrow and even‑handed
- Neutral experts (Rule 706) in neuropsychology/psychiatry/environmental health.
- Testing timeline: initiate within 30–60 days where feasible; disclose raw data; repeat or corroborate key findings.
- Special verdict form: have juries make discrete findings on (i) reactive event signature, (ii) pre‑offense dyscontrol history, (iii) neurocognitive inhibition deficits with valid effort, (iv) exclusion of intoxication/instrumentality, and (v) causal contribution to the instant act.
- Pattern instruction: frame the ultimate question as whether, due to proven dyscontrol, the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform his conduct at the time—emphasizing that general adversity or bad character does not suffice.

5) Disposition guidance
- Where the package shows true involuntary‑rage/automatism (dissociation to the point of nonvoluntary action), a complete excuse may be appropriate, followed by civil commitment if dangerousness persists.
- In closer cases of substantial but not complete impairment, channel to MPC‑style Extreme Emotional Disturbance (homicide) or to sentencing mitigation with ESB‑oriented conditions (housing relocation, trauma therapy, nutrition/sleep remediation, job pipelines), preserving victim safety through supervision.

Bottom line
- The suggested batteries (stop‑signal, antisaccade, affective tasks) and markers (historic BLLs, hair/salivary cortisol) are not temporally precise enough alone, but in a structured, corroborated bundle—anchored by event‑level evidence and pre‑offense records—they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a narrow class of reactive cases. The chief judicial risks are state–trait confounds, malingering, intoxication, and over‑reading sexy neuroscience. With pre‑specified elements, neutral expertise, and narrow offense limits, courts can honor Hart’s fairness limit without opening the floodgates or eroding protection for the communities most at risk.

---

### Speaker: Host

From the trial-management vantage point, how would you translate Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle into a workable pretrial protocol and a tightly framed jury instruction that keeps error costs and expressive harms low? Please be concrete: (i) what should a Rule 104/Daubert‑style hearing require the defense to proffer (checklist and exclusions, e.g., voluntary intoxication, planning indicators), and (ii) what model instruction would you give on a dyscontrol excuse (burden: clear and convincing; elements: substantial impairment of inhibitory control and causal contribution; limits: reactive vs. instrumental violence; intoxication defeats; no “partial” excuse—otherwise treat as mitigation).

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s core caution: none of these instruments time‑stamps volitional failure. If we are to let this evidence carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden, courts must demand tight convergence across mechanism, history, and the moment, and must cabin the doctrine to reactive violence. My touchstones remain Hart’s fairness limit and administrability.

On the proposed tools

- Neurocognitive batteries are probative only as part of a bundle. Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go (with a defensible SSRT estimate), antisaccade, and an affective inhibition task are the right center of gravity; Stroop/WCST are supportive but non‑specific. Require performance‑validity testing and cross‑task consistency, or the showing fails.
- Historic blood lead (BLL) records during sensitive developmental windows and early malnutrition/iron deficiency are reliable exposure markers; they do not prove momentary dyscontrol but they strengthen causal plausibility when paired with current control‑deficits.
- Diurnal or hair cortisol patterns can corroborate chronic stress but are noisy and easily over‑interpreted; treat as supportive, not determinative.
- I would exclude fMRI/EEG “pattern” evidence for guilt‑phase attribution at present; the Daubert factors (known error rates, standards, general acceptance for individual attribution) are not there.

What I would require to meet clear and convincing

Limit the excuse to affective/reactive violent offenses (e.g., non‑felony‑murder homicides, aggravated assaults) and require all of the following five pillars; any single failure defeats the excuse:

1) Event‑signature
- Acute provocation with seconds‑to‑minutes latency, disorganized execution, no luring or concealment, and contemporaneous indicia of dissociation/autonomic arousal (ideally bodycam/911/witness descriptions). Any meaningful planning or instrumental motive presumptively defeats the defense.

2) Pre‑offense documentation
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school/IEP discipline for explosive behavior, prior ED visits for rage/dissociation, juvenile mental‑health notes). This addresses temporality and guards against post‑hoc fabrication.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop) with intact performance‑validity indices and cross‑task convergence, plus a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available. Low–moderate psychopathic trait scores to support a reactive profile.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑diagnostic PTSD (dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder diagnosis by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the index trigger and dissociation. Physiological corroboration (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective exposure biomarker/history
- At least one developmental biological insult independent of litigation (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) plus a longitudinal deprivation profile (e.g., high‑ADI residence, underfunded schools) showing dose–response with current deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse; at most it goes to imperfect mitigation.
- Exclude primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB (that belongs in insanity), acute TBI at the scene, malingering (multiple PVTs), and strong instrumental motives.
- Timing: test as early as practicable and lean on pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact” effects. If results are unstable across sessions, the burden is not met.

Scientific pitfalls to police

- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, meds) depress test performance and cortisol; standardize conditions or repeat testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain; use embedded and stand‑alone validity measures and collateral informants.
- Reverse causation; prefer historic medical/educational/housing/EPA records over post‑charge findings.
- Over‑weighting non‑specific metrics; treat cortisol and non‑inhibitory cognitive tasks as corroborative, not core.

Gatekeeping and process

- Require a pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing keyed to a standardized checklist mirroring the pillars above; impose a strict notice requirement and structured proffer with documentary attachments (medical labs, school/CPS, UI, housing, EPA/HUD, geocoded addresses).
- Appoint neutral court experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to review both sides’ submissions; this mitigates “expert shopping” and equity concerns.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; narrow offense eligibility; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- If the showing falls short of excuse, the same evidence should be available for structured sentencing mitigation.

Jury instruction (model)

- To find the dyscontrol excuse, you must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (1) at the time of the offense the defendant’s capacity to inhibit a sudden aggressive impulse was substantially degraded by cumulative environmental deprivations and their biological sequelae; (2) the act was a reactive, non‑instrumental response to an acute trigger; and (3) the degraded capacity was a substantial factor causing the act. Evidence of planning, concealment, or voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse.

Disposition

- If excused, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision targeted to the identified mechanisms (trauma‑focused therapy, sleep/nutrition stabilization, toxin abatement/housing relocation, employment supports), with risk‑based conditions; reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous under applicable standards. This respects victims’ safety and public legitimacy.

Why this remains narrow

- Requiring contemporaneous event evidence, pre‑offense documentation, objective exposure markers, valid neurocognitive deficits, and a mapped psychiatric mechanism will confine the doctrine to a small subset of reactive violence in the top tail of cumulative adversity. That is where Hart’s “no fair opportunity” principle properly bites.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as givens, could you propose the core language of a model jury instruction for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse? Please specify: (i) the clear‑and‑convincing burden; (ii) that inhibitory control must have been substantially impaired and that this impairment was a substantial contributing cause of the act; and (iii) categorical exclusions (e.g., voluntary intoxication as proximate driver, planned/instrumental crimes). If you would cabin the instruction to reactive violent offenses, say so explicitly.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally sound, but as a matter of adjudication we must be exacting about what these tools can and cannot do, and we must cabin the doctrine to automatism‑like, reactive violence. None of the proposed measures is time‑stamped to the instant of the offense; their probative value comes only from convergence and “fit” with the event. I would therefore require a structured, pretrial showing under a clear‑and‑convincing standard with neutral experts, and I would limit eligibility to affective/reactive violent offenses. Here is how I would set the gate.

Mandatory event threshold (fail any, the excuse fails)
- Reactive signature: The act followed a salient trigger within moments (on the order of seconds to a very few minutes), with disorganized execution and no evidence of planning or cover‑up. Prefer contemporaneous corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam audio, eyewitness).
- No substantial voluntary intoxication: If alcohol/drugs were a substantial proximate cause of the loss of control, the excuse is barred. Mere presence is not dispositive, but the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Instrumentality screen: No luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental behavior (flight planning, concealment, intimidation). High instrumental features defeat the defense.

Mandatory pre‑offense corroboration (both required)
- Documented history of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol predating the offense by at least a year, from non‑forensic sources (school discipline/IEPs, ED visits, juvenile records, prior therapy notes, sleep disruption records). This addresses temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation.
- Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity: At least two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop) ≥1.5 SD below norms, with multiple performance‑validity tests passed, and either test–retest stability or cross‑task convergence. I would down‑weight WCST (set‑shifting) and treat classic Stroop as supportive only.

Corroborators (any two of the following)
- Psychiatric linkage that maps to the event: Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to pre‑existing records; symptom content plausibly explains the index trigger/response.
- Developmental biological insult: Independent documentation of childhood lead exposure (BLL ≥5 µg/dL, ideally repeated, or a prior ≥10), clinically established iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive windows, or well‑documented FASD risk.
- Chronic stress physiology: Hair cortisol indicating flattened/low output over the 3‑month pre‑offense window or comparably robust autonomic indices (low resting high‑frequency HRV). Treat as supportive; single‑day salivary profiles are too noisy.
- Trait profile: Low–moderate psychopathic traits (e.g., PCL‑R below moderate range) consistent with impulsive/reactive rather than predatory aggression, used cautiously.
- Collateral history: Longitudinal caregiver/teacher/employer accounts of explosive, stimulus‑bound episodes, with dates and contexts.

Disqualifiers/controls the court should police
- Malingering/secondary gain: Require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; beware selective or “too bad to be true” performance; look for stability across sessions.
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and litigation stress degrade performance and blunt cortisol. Standardize testing conditions and, where possible, repeat or corroborate with pre‑offense records.
- Alternative primary drivers: Exclude cases where acute psychosis/mania (not traceable to the RSB exposures at issue), recent TBI, or a strong instrumental motive better explains the behavior.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: Historic BLLs and hair cortisol are not moment‑of‑offense meters; they are probative only as part of a coherent mechanism/history narrative. I would exclude fMRI as determinative and admit it, if at all, as low‑weight support under Daubert with explicit limiting instructions.

Minimum bundle to reach clear and convincing
At a minimum, the record should show: (1) a convincingly reactive event signature; (2) pre‑offense, non‑forensic documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol; (3) valid neurocognitive evidence of impaired inhibition on two tasks; plus (4) either a well‑supported psychiatric diagnosis that maps to the index event or a documented developmental toxin/malnutrition exposure consistent with the measured deficits; and (5) exclusion of intoxication/malingering/instrumentality. Absent this bundle, the showing falls back to mitigation, not excuse.

Procedural safeguards and fit
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with written, element‑by‑element findings on reliability (known error rates, standards, general acceptance) and “fit” to the event facts.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Pattern instruction: make explicit that the question is substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the act, not a general propensity; prohibit “the brain made me do it” rhetoric; place the clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense.
- Bifurcation: keep guilt and excuse phases distinct to preserve jury focus and legitimacy.

Bottom line on specificity and temporality
The stop‑signal/antisaccade/affective Go–No‑Go family is the best available window on inhibition, but effect sizes are modest and state‑sensitive; stress markers (hair cortisol) and historic BLLs speak to mechanism and developmental insult, not momentary control. Courts should treat each as one strand in a braided rope. Only when the rope holds—reactive facts, pre‑offense corroboration, valid inhibition deficits, plausible clinical mapping, and exclusion of better explanations—should we remove the moral condemnation attached to conviction. In all other cases, reserve RSB for structured mitigation at sentencing or, in homicide, MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance. This preserves Hart’s fairness limit without turning criminal trials into open‑ended social inquests.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming the court recognizes a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the lines Prof. Santiago and Dr. Chen sketched, please draft a concise, administrable model jury instruction that covers: (i) what counts as “substantial impairment of inhibitory control”; (ii) how to distinguish “reactive” from instrumental aggression; (iii) the defendant’s burden (clear and convincing) and exclusion of voluntary intoxication as a proximate cause; and (iv) how jurors should weigh converging evidence (event phenomenology, pre‑offense records, neurocognitive tests with validity checks, and exposure biomarkers). Would you deliver this in a bifurcated proceeding, and what limiting instruction would you give to minimize sympathy/nullification from deprivation evidence?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 asks the right question—can we link cumulative deprivation to a loss of inhibitory control at the moment of the offense? Dr. Chen is correct that no single instrument is temporally precise or specific enough; only a convergent package, tightly policed, can justify case‑level attribution. My concern is administrability and error costs. I would trim the toolkit, tighten the exclusions, and confine the doctrine to the narrow band of reactive violence for which a complete excuse is defensible. Everything else should travel as mitigation (or, in homicide, MPC‑style EED).

Are the proposed measures specific/temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal, Go/No‑Go, antisaccade; an affective interference task) can support an inference of impaired inhibition as a trait vulnerability; they cannot timestamp momentary loss of control. Use them as corroboration, never as the fulcrum.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic BLLs speak to mechanism and temporality (developmental insult precedes deficits). They are supportive but not dispositive and are prone to confounds.
- I would exclude fMRI/advanced neuroimaging for decisional purposes in individual cases. Admissible, if at all, only as background science.

Minimum bundle to satisfy a clear‑and‑convincing standard
Require all six pillars below; failure on any is disqualifying. This keeps the defense rare and cabined to involuntary‑rage/dyscontrol cases.

1) Event signature (reactive, not instrumental)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; seconds/minutes latency; disorganized execution; no luring/preparation/concealment.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/bodycam/witness) of dissociation/“saw red,” marked autonomic arousal; brief post‑event confusion. If planning or post‑event instrumental behavior is present, the defense should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile/clinic notes of dissociation or IED; prior ED visits after rage episodes; sleep disruption) showing stimulus‑bound control failures. This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy/antisocial trait indices to support an impulsive (not predatory) profile.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to the Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the index trigger and dissociation. Biological stress corroborators (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) are helpful but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independently documented childhood exposure: BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated, or a ≥10 spike), or iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or well‑documented FASD risk; plus a plausible path from that exposure to current executive deficits.

6) Exclusions/negative controls
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as the proximate driver defeat the excuse. The defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, malingering (multiple PVTs), and strong instrumental motive.
- Where feasible, sibling/within‑person negative controls or pre‑offense testing bolster attribution but are not required.

Scientific pitfalls the court should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, pain, or incarceration stress can depress performance and cortisol; standardize testing and lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple effort measures; beware selective deficits and “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles.
- Intoxication: separate chronic toxin history (lead, FASD) from acute voluntary substance effects.
- Base‑rate/over‑interpretation: do not treat any biomarker (cortisol, imaging) as a momentary control gauge.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and equity)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer tied to the six pillars; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA, UI, geocoded residence histories).
- Offense scope: confine the complete excuse to reactive violent offenses (homicide/serious assaults). Planned acquisitive crimes are out. Cases that fall short may proceed only as mitigation (or MPC §210.3 EED in homicide).
- Burden: clear and convincing evidence that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of offense and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Resource parity: fund indigent defendants to meet these showings, or the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

Disposition
- If the complete excuse is found, prefer noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy; housing relocation from criminogenic zones; nutrition/sleep interventions; employment services). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.
- If the showing falls short, channel RSB into structured sentencing mitigation, keyed to verified deprivation/biological indicators; in homicide, EED can reduce degree.

Bottom line
Used this way, the batteries and markers are not silver bullets, but in convergence—with a reactive event signature and pre‑offense documentation—they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment in a narrow class of cases. The proposed six‑pillar gate, tight exclusions, and offense limits preserve public legitimacy while honoring Hart’s fairness limit: no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your evidence‑and‑instructions hat: based on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage criteria and Dr. Chen’s cautions, could you draft a concrete model jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse? Please specify (i) what categories of evidence jurors may consider and how to weigh converging findings against event‑level features, and (ii) what cannot suffice as a matter of law (e.g., poverty alone, voluntary intoxication, sole reliance on post‑charge testing). In addition, outline a brief Daubert‑style gatekeeping checklist for trial judges to apply pretrial so the instruction only reaches the jury in administrable, high‑integrity cases.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you, Chair. From a judge’s vantage, Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 framework is broadly on the right track, but it needs tightening for courtroom use. The science (as Dr. Chen notes) cannot time‑stamp loss of control; the law’s job is to cabin an inference of substantial volitional impairment to rare, reactive events, with clear guardrails. Here is how I would structure admissibility and proof.

1) Gatekeeping and burden
- Separate phase: Try the dyscontrol excuse after guilt (as with insanity), to preserve jury focus and avoid prejudice.
- Burden/standard: Defendant bears clear and convincing evidence that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.
- Daubert/Kelly hearing: Require a structured proffer tied to specific elements below; appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.

2) Minimum convergence required (no single strand suffices)
Require all four anchors; failure on any is disqualifying.

A. Event‑level “reactive violence” signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; no luring or weapon staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions (by witnesses, recordings) of “blanking out,” marked autonomic arousal; minimal post‑event concealment.
- Presumptive exclusion: evidence of planning/instrumental motive (e.g., ambush, concealment steps).

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (non‑forensic, predating the charge)
- School/juvenile or medical records reflecting episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, prior ED visits for rage/dissociation, longstanding sleep disruption), or a well‑documented trauma history with clinically recorded dissociation/IED symptoms. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive evidence of impaired inhibition, with validity
- At least two tasks directly tied to inhibition/affect regulation ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, Go/No‑Go/antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), administered within ~60–90 days, with multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and, ideally, replication or cross‑test convergence.
- Down‑weight WCST; it is too nonspecific. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive—not predatory—aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

D. Objective exposure/physiological corroboration consistent with mechanism
- At least one developmental biological insult documented independent of litigation: historic childhood blood lead (≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated or any ≥10), iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or well‑documented FASD risk; OR
- Chronic stress physiology consistent with trauma (e.g., hair cortisol segment showing blunted diurnal output), recognizing this is supportive, not dispositive.
- A current DSM‑5 trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established with structured instruments, with symptom content that plausibly maps to the index event.

3) Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as the proximate driver defeat the excuse; the defendant must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the time; malingering (failures on performance‑validity testing); strong instrumental motives—all defeat the claim.
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing (sleep, meds); give greater weight to pre‑offense records; be wary of post‑charge stress effects on cortisol and test performance.

4) Evidentiary admissibility notes
- Neuroimaging (fMRI/EEG): admissible, if at all, only as low‑weight corroboration; not diagnostic of individual volitional capacity.
- Cortisol: prefer hair cortisol over single‑day saliva; require documentation of confounders (hair treatments, medications). Treat as supportive, not necessary.
- Lead/toxin records: weight them heavily if contemporaneous pediatric labs exist; they add causal plausibility when aligned with current inhibition deficits.

5) Offense domain limitation
- Confine the excuse to reactive violent offenses (homicide, aggravated assault) arising within minutes of an acute trigger. Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime and organized retaliatory violence. For homicide, retain MPC‑style EED as a partial mitigation when the full excuse is not met.

6) Jury instruction (core concepts, in plain language)
- Define “substantial impairment” as a marked, situationally triggered failure of inhibitory control that left the defendant without a fair opportunity to conform his conduct to law at the moment, as shown by the converging evidence.
- Make clear: general hardship or deprivation, standing alone, is not a defense; sympathy is not a basis for verdict; voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse.
- Use a special verdict form requiring specific findings on each anchor and on disqualifiers.

7) Disposition if excused
- ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment pathways), with civil commitment available only upon the usual mental‑health standards if the person remains dangerous. Provide robust victim input and safety planning.

8) Equity and administrability safeguards
- Funding parity for indigent defendants to obtain records and testing; otherwise the doctrine will skew toward the well‑resourced.
- Standardized documentary templates (geocoded address histories linked to ADI/violent‑crime exposure; pediatric labs; CPS/school/housing/EPA records).
- Neutral “exposure assessment” capability (court‑appointed) to reduce dueling experts and mini‑trials.

Bottom line: The proposed batteries and markers, individually, are neither specific nor temporally precise. As a predefined bundle—event signature, pre‑offense records, validated inhibition deficits, and an objective exposure/physiological corroborator, with alternatives excluded—they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a narrow slice of cases. That preserves Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply—while keeping the gate tight enough to protect public legitimacy and victims.

### Speaker: Host

You were cut off—please complete your point on distinguishing voluntary intoxication at the time of offense from developmental “toxin history” (e.g., lead, FASD). How should courts parse causation when both are present in a case: what evidentiary showing would indicate intoxication was the proximate driver (defeating the excuse) versus background neurotoxicity materially degrading baseline control (potentially preserving it)?

---

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

Over-interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI, EEG, and structural MRI are, at present, group-level tools with modest individual-level predictive value. They are susceptible to motion artifacts, circular ROI selection, analytic flexibility, and publication bias. I would treat any imaging as exploratory and non-dispositive; do not allow a scan to “prove” dyscontrol.

Additional pitfalls and how to guard against them
- Norms and measurement error: Executive tests require age-, sex-, education-, and language-appropriate norms; low literacy or ESL can depress scores. Use nonverbal tasks where appropriate and document normative matching.
- Test–retest/practice effects: Poor reliability can inflate deficits; repeat selected tasks or use alternate forms to confirm stability.
- Multiple comparisons/fishing: Pre-register a testing battery and primary endpoints; avoid “kitchen-sink” testing and post hoc cherry-picking.
- Trait confounds and base rates: High ACEs and some EF deficits are common in justice-involved populations. The case must show that the measured impairments are unusually severe and mechanistically tied to the index offense (event signature and temporality are critical).
- PCL‑R and bias: Use with caution; avoid over-reliance due to known concerns about cross-racial validity and labeling effects.
- Biomarker confounds:
  - Hair cortisol: affected by hair treatments, ethnicity, and environmental contamination; document hair care practices and use appropriate wash protocols.
  - HRV: influenced by respiration, beta-blockers, fitness; standardize acquisition and collect medication data.
  - Historic BLL: require certified lab records or public health reports; be wary of retrospective self-report.
- Dissociation and suggestibility: For PTSD/dissociative claims, use structured interviews (e.g., CAPS‑5) and collateral reports; beware iatrogenic inflation.
- Intoxication and mixed causation: Alcohol/stimulants acutely degrade inhibition; absent involuntary ingestion, voluntary intoxication should presumptively defeat the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.

How specific/temporally sensitive is the bundle?
- Specificity: A multi-domain EF deficit with valid performance, documented developmental insults (e.g., childhood lead), and chronic stress physiology increases specificity to a dyscontrol mechanism, particularly when psychopathic traits are low and psychiatric phenotyping fits (PTSD/IED).
- Temporality: No tool time-stamps the millisecond of offense. We achieve temporal inference by: (a) pre-offense records of reactive dyscontrol; (b) exposures that predate the offense; (c) an event pattern of affective, stimulus-bound aggression; and (d) testing soon after the event with replication/triangulation.

Minimum converging bundle (clear-and-convincing)
I would require all of the following:
1) Event-level reactive profile: rapid escalation to violence after salient provocation; disorganized act; no planning/cover-up; contemporaneous descriptions or audiovisual corroboration of “seeing red”/autonomic arousal.
2) Pre-offense documentation: nonforensic, pre-charge records evidencing episodic dyscontrol (school/juvenile/clinic/ED notes) and sleep disruption patterns.
3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity: ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect-regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No-Go/Stroop), stable across sessions, with multiple passed performance-validity tests; plus impulsive choice (e.g., steep delay discounting). Low–moderate PCL‑R supports an impulsive, not predatory, profile.
4) Psychiatric linkage: structured-diagnosed PTSD (ideally dissociative subtype) or IED with symptom triggers mapping to the index event; biological stress corroboration (hair cortisol or similar) desirable but not mandatory.
5) Objective developmental insult: certified childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or ≥10 µg/dL once), or documented FASD risk, or iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive periods—independent of litigation—plus plausible linkage to current EF deficits.

And all of the following exclusions/controls:
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver.
- No primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI as the main cause (unless separately addressed by insanity doctrines).
- Negative malingering indicators (multiple PVTs; cross-source consistency).
- Consideration of alternative motives; any strong instrumental planning should defeat the claim.

Process safeguards to enhance reliability
- Court-appointed neutral experts; pretrial Daubert hearing with a structured proffer tied to these elements.
- Pre-specified testing protocol; standardized documentation (medical, CPS, school, housing, EPA/health department records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Early testing (ideally within 30–60 days) with replication where feasible; heavy weight on pre-offense records to mitigate reverse causation.

Bottom line
No single test can establish momentary loss of control. But when a reactive event signature is tightly aligned with pre-existing dyscontrol documented before the offense, validated deficits on inhibition tasks, a fitting psychiatric phenotype, and objective developmental insults known to impair prefrontal control—and when intoxication, malingering, and instrumental motives are excluded—the science can support a clear-and-convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment at the time of the offense. Cases that fall short should channel RSB evidence to sentencing mitigation and ESB-oriented conditions rather than a full excuse.

---

### Speaker: Host

Given Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions about specificity and temporality, if you were writing the rule, what would your pretrial gatekeeping order and model jury instruction look like for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse? Please specify: (i) the burden and enumerated elements; (ii) how you would define “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and cabin it to reactive, not instrumental, violence; (iii) explicit disqualifiers (e.g., planning, voluntary intoxication); and (iv) how to guide jurors to weigh converging evidence without overvaluing post‑offense testing. Be concrete—sample language welcome.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen has it about right on the science: no single test can time‑stamp loss of control. For courts, the question is whether a convergent, pre‑specified bundle can support, by clear and convincing evidence, that volitional control was substantially degraded at the moment of a reactive offense. My view—consistent with a narrow, administrable “involuntary‑rage/automatism” avenue—is:

1) Offense domain and burden
- Limit the excuse to genuinely reactive violence (seconds to a few minutes after a salient provocation), with no luring, staging, or concealment. Planned acquisitive crimes are out; those belong, at most, in mitigation.
- Affirmative defense; notice required; defendant bears clear and convincing proof that (a) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (b) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse.

2) Gatekeeping (Daubert-style) and neutral expertise
- Pretrial admissibility hearing keyed to a structured checklist.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; performance‑validity testing is mandatory.

3) Minimum convergence required to reach the jury
Require all five pillars below; failure on any is disqualifying:

A. Event signature (moment-of-offense)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a concrete trigger; disorganized execution; contemporaneous observations of dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”), autonomic arousal, or post‑event confusion. Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam audio). Any weapon retrieval/lay‑in, luring, or post‑event concealment presumptively defeats.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense that reflect stimulus‑bound dyscontrol: school discipline/IEPs for explosive behavior, juvenile clinical notes (IED/dissociation), prior ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption. This guards against reverse causation and “forensic artifact.”

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks tightly linked to control (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests passed and either retest stability or cross‑task convergence.
- Downweight WCST; it is nonspecific. Use trait measures cautiously; high predatory/psychopathic traits undercut a reactive dyscontrol theory.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to exposures documented before the offense and with symptom content that plausibly explains the trigger/response pattern. This is clinical linkage, not a label created post hoc.

E. Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one developmental biological insult documented independent of litigation—e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or any ≥10), documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk. These do not prove the moment, but they make the measured executive deficits mechanistically plausible.

4) Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication at or near the offense; acute psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; malingering (failed PVTs); clear instrumental motive or planning; acute TBI at the scene (that is a different doctrine).
- Testing should occur promptly (ideally within 30–60 days), with standardized conditions (sleep, meds), and be corroborated by pre‑offense records.

5) What I would not rely on to carry the day
- Single‑day salivary cortisol; it is noisy. Hair cortisol over a 3‑month segment may corroborate chronic stress but is supportive only and susceptible to confounds (hair treatment, ethnicity). fMRI belongs, if at all, as background science, not case‑level proof. ACE counts alone are nonspecific.

Scientific pitfalls to flag for trial courts
- State–trait confounding: sleep loss, medication changes, acute legal stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Use actigraphy or collateral documentation; consider repeat testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity indicators and cross‑source corroboration.
- Ecological fallacy/base rates: many people with adversity test abnormalities never offend; hence the insistence on event‑level signature plus pre‑offense documentation.
- Cultural/test‑norm issues: ensure appropriate norms and qualified examiners; otherwise, spurious “deficits” risk inequity.

Jury management and instructions
- Bifurcate. If the gate is met, give a tailored instruction: the defense must show that because of documented developmental insults and chronic stress, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit a reflexive, affect‑driven response was substantially degraded at the time of the sudden provocation, such that he could not reasonably have conformed his conduct. Make clear this is not a license for planned violence or a response to generalized hardship.
- Consider a special verdict on (1) reactive nature of the event and (2) substantial degradation of control causing the act.

Disposition
- If excused, favor ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused treatment, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports), with civil commitment available only upon the usual mental‑illness/dangerousness criteria. If the bundle is strong but falls short, the same evidence should be available for MPC‑style EED in homicide or structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation and exposure indicators.

Bottom line
Dr. Chen’s caution is well‑taken: these measures are not timepieces. But with a tight domain (reactive violence), clear burden, neutral expertise, and a five‑pillar convergence anchored in pre‑offense records and event signature, courts can admit a small number of meritorious cases without opening the floodgates or eroding victim protection. This keeps faith with Hart’s fairness limit while preserving administrability and public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing both your evidence hat and your administrability lens: assuming we adopted Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution bundle, what concretely would you put into the doctrine and the courtroom to keep it tight? Please be specific on (i) the Daubert‑style pretrial showing and who bears what burdens; (ii) an instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” for jurors (including how to handle voluntary intoxication and planning evidence); (iii) whether to limit applicability to reactive violent offenses; and (iv) safeguards against disparate application (e.g., court‑appointed neutral experts, standardized records templates, special verdict forms, bifurcation). Where do you see the highest error‑cost risks, and how would you draft around them without gutting the moral core Bazelon is after?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Two points at the threshold. First, none of the Stage 2 tools—stop-signal, Stroop, WCST, cortisol profiles, historic BLLs—can, standing alone, time‑stamp a loss of inhibitory control at the moment of offense. Second, courts can nonetheless reach a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a narrow class of reactive cases by demanding convergence across independent lines of proof and by excluding more plausible alternative drivers. Dr. Chen’s scientific map is broadly right; the job for the court is to convert it into a disciplined gate.

What I would require as a minimum, before a jury ever hears it, at a Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing with neutral court‑appointed experts and standardized proffers:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Provocation followed by seconds/minutes‑later violence; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam/witnesses) of “blanking out,” autonomic arousal, or dissociation.
- Any evidence of planning, instrumental motive, concealment, or cool‑down undermines the claim and should presumptively defeat it.

2) Pre‑offense documentary history of dyscontrol (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes, prior ED visits for rage/dissociation, documented sleep disruption) showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control.
- This is the best antidote to reverse causation and post‑charge artifact.

3) Neurocognitive evidence tied to inhibition, with validity safeguards
- At least two deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on tasks that directly assay inhibition/affect regulation (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT; antisaccade; affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus intact performance‑validity testing (embedded and stand‑alone).
- Downweight WCST; include a delay‑discounting measure if available; low–moderate psychopathic traits to support an impulsive—not predatory—profile.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis consistent with the mechanism (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored in pre‑offense exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and response in the instant case.
- Stress biomarkers (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) may corroborate chronic load but are never dispositive.

5) At least one objective developmental biological insult consistent with mechanism
- Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (repeated if possible, or any prior ≥10), or documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk—all from independent, pre‑litigation records. These don’t date the moment, but they materially strengthen causal plausibility when paired with current inhibition deficits.

And mandatory exclusions/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse; the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute substances.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures belongs in a different doctrinal box.
- Malingering: multiple PVTs, consistency across sessions, and collateral informants.
- Testing conditions: standardize sleep/meds; repeat or triangulate results; heavy reliance on pre‑charge records.
- Limit the offense domain to prototypically reactive violence (homicide/assault). Planned acquisitive crime should be out.

On specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Inhibition tasks are state‑sensitive and nonspecific; cortisol is noisy and better for chronic, not acute, stress; historic BLLs index developmental insult, not contemporaneous control. The law should treat each as one strand; the “moment” inference must come from the event signature plus temporally anchored history, with the tests supporting mechanism.

Scientific/legal pitfalls to watch
- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, pain, medication changes, incarceration stress) depressing performance; insist on standardized testing and, where possible, repeat administration.
- Base‑rate neglect and “N=1 neuroscience”: do not infer from a group correlation to an individual moment without the event signature and pre‑offense history.
- Performance validity and coaching; beware selective “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Demographic/norming problems on cognitive tasks; insist on appropriate norms and expert explanation.
- Conflating chronic “toxin” history with acute substance effects.
- Rule 403: Stage 1 deprivation evidence is admissible only insofar as it is part of a causal chain to volitional impairment; avoid a free‑ranging social indictment in the guilt phase.

Burden, procedure, and instructions
- Burden on the defense: clear and convincing evidence that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Pretrial Daubert hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) and notice requirements; standardized templates for documentary proof (medical labs, CPS/school/housing/EPA/UI records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Limiting/jury instruction: define “substantial impairment” as a marked, stimulus‑bound inability to inhibit an immediate impulsive response—beyond ordinary anger—at the time of the act; instruct that poverty or adversity alone is insufficient, and that planning/instrumentality and voluntary intoxication defeat the excuse.

Disposition
- If excused, favor ESB‑oriented, court‑supervised conditions (trauma‑focused therapy, stable housing away from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. This answers victim‑protection concerns without converting the excuse into a revolving door.

Bottom line
- The proposed batteries and biomarkers are useful only as part of a tight, five‑pillar bundle. Demand event‑level reactivity, pre‑offense documentation, validated inhibition deficits, a diagnostic linkage, and at least one developmental biological insult, while excluding intoxication and planning. With those guardrails, the dyscontrol excuse will remain rare, administrable, and morally defensible. For the many hard cases that don’t meet this bar, MPC‑style EED in homicide and structured sentencing mitigation are the appropriate homes for RSB.

---

### Speaker: Host

Dr. Chen just underscored that no single test can time‑stamp volitional failure, and that only a convergent bundle warrants a dyscontrol excuse. From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, sketch the concrete courtroom architecture you’d endorse to make this workable: (i) the pretrial gatekeeping steps (Rule 104(a)/Daubert, notice, neutral experts) and the offense classes to which the defense is confined; (ii) the burden and exact elements the jury must find; and (iii) model, paragraph‑length jury instructions that capture “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause” without inviting nullification. Please be specific about how you’d handle partial showings (e.g., strong adversity but mixed event‑level indicators) and ensure funding parity so the doctrine doesn’t become a rich defendant’s defense.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen has it right on the science: no single test can time‑stamp a loss of control. If courts are to admit a dyscontrol excuse at all, it must be through a narrow, rule‑governed gate that demands convergence across history, mechanism, and the instant event. Below is the judicial package I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing burden, together with guardrails to keep the doctrine administrable and legitimate.

A. Domain and burden
- Offense domain: reactive, affect‑laden violence (e.g., sudden assaults/homicides) with minimal planning. Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes and offenses evidencing luring, staging, concealment, or flight plans.
- Burden/standard: defendant bears clear and convincing evidence.
- Theory framed as excuse (involuntary‑rage automatism), not justification: the claim is “could not help myself,” not “was permitted to do it.”

B. Minimum convergence bundle (all five required)
1) Event signature (proximate moment)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; no preparatory conduct; contemporaneous indicia of autonomic arousal and dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”), preferably corroborated by 911/body‑cam/video and neutral eyewitnesses.
- Any evidence of instrumental planning/post‑event management defeats the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol: school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental health notes, ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption tied to neighborhood conditions. This protects against reverse causation from the prosecution itself.

3) Neurocognitive battery with validity (mechanism)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below age‑norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal/SSRT, Go/No‑Go, antisaccade; include an affective variant such as emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop).
- Include delay‑discounting or similar impulsive choice measure.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone); replicate findings or demonstrate cross‑test convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression (e.g., low‑to‑moderate PCL‑R; used cautiously).

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event (diagnosis and fit)
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom content and triggers plausibly aligned to the index event and anchored in pre‑offense life history.
- Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not dispositive and must be interpreted by neutral experts.

5) Objective developmental exposure biomarker (causal plausibility)
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one relevant insult during sensitive windows: childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or any ≥10), documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or FASD risk; plus corroboration that these exposures plausibly contribute to current executive deficits.
- Social deprivation indices (e.g., ADI decile, school poverty) belong at eligibility/sentencing; here they are supportive, not sufficient.

C. Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse; the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of substances if any were present.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to the RSB pathway, acute TBI at offense, or strong instrumental motives defeat the excuse; those belong in other doctrines.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple validity indices, cross‑source consistency, collateral informants.
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing (sleep, meds), prefer early testing (within 30–60 days) and triangulate with pre‑offense records.

D. Gatekeeping and procedure (administrability)
- Mandatory pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to the elements above; defendant must proffer documentary exhibits (medical labs, CPS/school files, housing/EPA/HUD orders, geocoded residence history).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to reduce “hired gun” effects; limit neuroimaging to supportive use only.
- Pattern instruction (example core): “You must find that at the time of the act, the defendant’s bodily movement was not the product of his conscious effort or determination because of a sudden, overwhelming affective state, and that this state was substantially caused by verified developmental exposures and chronic stressors. A mere weakening of self‑control, high emotion, or anger is insufficient.”
- Bifurcation: try actus/mens rea first; if necessary, proceed to the excuse phase with specialized instructions. This preserves jury focus and legitimacy.

E. Disposition if excused
- ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused care, safe housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines). Dangerousness is addressed through civil commitment where statutory criteria are met; otherwise, court‑supervised ESB conditions with victim‑safety planning.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants to meet the evidentiary showings; otherwise the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

F. Scientific pitfalls courts should watch
- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, incarceration stress) depressing test performance and cortisol; mitigate with timing, replication, and historical records.
- Malingering/secondary gain; insist on validity testing and collateral data.
- Over‑interpretation of cortisol, HRV, or imaging; treat as supportive context, not determinative proof.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge stress can mimic chronic stress signatures; hair cortisol (3‑month window) and pre‑charge records help.
- Lead and other biomarkers are developmental plausibility, not moment‑of‑offense measures; the legal inference must rest on the totality, especially the event signature.

G. Fallback channel
- When the bundle falls short for excuse, the same record should presumptively inform sentencing mitigation through a structured framework (validated deprivation indicators: chronic unemployment, verified toxin exposure, early malnutrition), with ESB conditions and victim‑centered safeguards.

This approach honors Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply—while containing error costs. Requiring all five pillars, plus disqualifiers, keeps the class small, largely limited to the top tail of cumulative adversity whose mechanism and moment actually line up.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, do Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle and disqualifiers meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard without turning trials into mini‑Daubert seminars? Please be concrete: (a) outline a gatekeeping checklist you would adopt at a pretrial hearing; (b) say whether you’d mandate court‑appointed neutral experts and cap party experts; (c) draft a short jury instruction that ties Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit to "reactive dyscontrol" while preserving the State’s ability to argue planning; and (d) name the two biggest error risks you foresee (e.g., intoxication, malingering, forensic artifact) and exactly how you’d bound them at trial.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Bottom line. None of the proposed instruments is temporally precise or specific enough, standing alone, to prove loss of inhibitory control at the moment of offense. In a narrow class of reactive cases, a convergent bundle can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment. The bundle must align mechanism, history, and the event, and courts must police state–trait confounds, malingering, and intoxication relentlessly.

On the tools and their limits
- Neurocognitive tasks. Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go (SSRT) and antisaccade are the most on‑point proxies for motor inhibition; an affective variant (emotional Go‑No‑Go/affective Stroop) adds ecological relevance. Classic Stroop and WCST are too nonspecific to carry much weight. All require performance‑validity testing and, ideally, replication or cross‑task convergence.
- Stress/biologic markers. Childhood blood‑lead histories (repeated or one markedly elevated measure in sensitive periods) are probative of developmental injury to control systems; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition similarly. Hair cortisol can index chronic load pre‑offense but is noisy; single‑day salivary profiles are of limited forensic value. None of these “time‑stamp” the instant offense.
- Psychiatric diagnoses. PTSD (dissociative subtype) or IED anchored to pre‑offense records can link exposure to mechanism; diagnosis alone is insufficient.

What I would require to reach “clear and convincing” (highly probable)
I would not admit this excuse to the jury unless the court, after a Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing, finds all five pillars below are met with independent documentation and neutral‑expert support:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions of dissociation (“went blank/ saw red”) or marked autonomic arousal. Prefer objective corroboration (video/911/body‑cam).

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound outbursts or dissociation (school IEP/discipline, juvenile mental‑health notes, ED visits) and chronic sleep disruption, not merely post‑charge reports.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/affective Stroop) with intact effort indices (embedded PVTs + stand‑alone TOMM/others) and either replication over time or cross‑test convergence. Trait psychopathy indices should not be used to label, but low‑to‑moderate scores can help exclude predatory profile.

4) Diagnosed linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; IED) by a qualified clinician, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response pattern in the offense and anchored to exposures documented before the offense. Biological corroboration (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) is supportive but not essential.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent proof of at least one biological insult (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) that predates and plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse. As a rule, BAC ≥0.08 or stimulant positive with behavioral evidence of intoxication should bar the defense unless involuntary. If substances were present but not proximate, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Planning/instrumentality. Evidence of planning, weapon staging, luring, or post‑event concealment defeats the excuse; such cases should be channeled, if anywhere, to EED/diminished capacity or sentencing mitigation.
- Malingering and “forensic artifact.” Require multiple validity indices, consistency across sessions, and collateral informants. Heavy reliance on pre‑charge records to blunt reverse‑causation (incarceration stress) and coaching.
- Primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI at offense time call for different doctrines; do not mix them into an RSB dyscontrol excuse.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and equity)
- Offense domain. Limit to reactive violent offenses and, in rare cases, truly impulsive dangerous conduct; exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden/standard. Defense bears clear‑and‑convincing proof that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Gatekeeping. Pretrial notice; standardized documentary proffers (medical labs, CPS/school/housing/EPA/UI, geocoded residence history); court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Timing. Testing within 30–90 days where practicable; courts should heavily weight pre‑offense documentation over post‑charge testing.
- Jury management. Bifurcated proceedings; tailored instructions defining “substantial impairment” as a marked, situational failure of inhibitory control akin to an irresistible impulse, not simply heightened anger or poor judgment; admonitions on the limited role of biomarkers.

Scientific pitfalls courts should be most alert to
- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, meds, pain, acute legal stress) depressing executive scores; mitigate with standardized conditions and, where feasible, actigraphy and repeat testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain and selective underperformance; demand multiple PVTs and collateral corroboration.
- Acute intoxication masquerading as dyscontrol; treat as disqualifying unless involuntary.
- Reverse causation and “forensic artifact” cortisol/behavior changes post‑arrest; prefer hair cortisol for pre‑offense window and, above all, pre‑charge records.
- Base‑rate fallacy and over‑reading group data; require individual‑level alignment across pillars before drawing causal inferences.
- Overuse of nonspecific tools (WCST, single‑day salivary cortisol) and fMRI show‑and‑tell; admit only as supportive, not dispositive.

Dispositions (if the excuse is found)
- ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, safe housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, education/employment supports). If the person remains demonstrably dangerous and meets civil‑commitment criteria, route accordingly. Use a special verdict (e.g., “Not Guilty by Reason of Dyscontrol due to Severe Environmental Deprivation”) to trigger the ESB track.

Where this fits in the larger architecture
- This is the narrow “involuntary‑rage/dyscontrol” avenue I can support. Cases falling short of the bundle should be channeled to MPC‑style EED in homicide or to structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation and toxin exposure. I remain opposed to broad societal‑fault apportionment at guilt.

With these guardrails, we honor Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply—while preserving administrability and public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, you’ve stressed administrability and error costs. Taking Prof. Santiago’s two-stage framework and Dr. Chen’s “five pillars,” please translate this into courtroom operations. First, specify a concrete pretrial gatekeeping protocol (Daubert-style): what documentary proffer must the defense submit, what expert(s) should be appointed, what disqualifiers trigger summary denial, and how the clear‑and‑convincing burden is applied at the hearing. Second, draft a tight model jury instruction for a dyscontrol excuse defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause,” with guidance on (a) reactive versus instrumental conduct; (b) voluntary intoxication; and (c) weighing conflicting experts. Aim for operational clarity that trial judges and jurors can actually use.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Dr. Chen’s cautions track exactly what a court must police: no single instrument or biomarker can timestamp “loss of control” at the offense; only a convergent showing, tightly tied to the event, can justify putting an excuse to a jury. From an administrability and evidence-law perspective, I would adopt a narrow Stage‑2 gate with specified pillars, Daubert vetting, and clear limiting rules.

1) What the tools can and cannot do
- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go/antisaccade/affective Stroop: probative of inhibitory control when deficits are consistent across tasks and sessions with valid effort indices. They are state‑sensitive; one poor sitting is not enough.
- WCST: weakly specific to inhibition; I would downweight or omit.
- PCL‑R: use only to exclude predatory profiles; do not let it drive the analysis.
- Stress markers: hair cortisol (3 cm) is preferable to single‑day saliva for chronic load; still supportive only. Historic childhood blood lead levels (BLLs) are probative developmental insults if documented contemporaneously. Structural/functional MRI should not be admitted absent exceptional foundation; the “seductive allure” risk under 403 outweighs marginal probative value in individual attribution.

2) Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
Require all five pillars; failure on any is disqualifying. Defense bears the burden.

A. Event‑level signature
- Rapid, affective escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment; contemporaneous observations (video/911/body‑cam/witness) of “blanking out,” autonomic arousal. Any evidence of planning or post‑offense instrumental steps should presumptively defeat the excuse.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing stimulus‑bound outbursts/dissociation (school IEPs, juvenile notes, ED visits, verified sleep disruption), showing temporality and reducing reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with:
  - Multiple performance‑validity tests passed (embedded and stand‑alone),
  - Replication or cross‑task convergence,
  - Low–moderate psychopathic traits consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established by a qualified clinician, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the triggering and phenomenology of the offense. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not essential.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- At least one contemporaneously documented biological/environmental insult: childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (repeat measures or one ≥10 preferred), iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition markers, or well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure. If such records are unavailable through no fault of the defendant, the court may accept functionally equivalent contemporaneous proxies (e.g., HUD/EPA lead hazard orders tied to residence plus pediatric notes of pica and later executive deficits), but only with strong corroboration.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication proximate to the act defeats the excuse absent compelling proof that baseline dyscontrol—not the substance—drove the behavior.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at offense; malingering (failed PVTs); clear instrumental motive.
- Testing conditions: standardize sleep/meds/caffeine; when feasible, retest to mitigate state confounds.

3) Gatekeeping mechanics
- Pretrial Daubert hearing with a structured proffer tied to the five pillars; court‑appointed neutral experts (Rule 706) in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; enforce validated instruments, known error rates, and normative references.
- No “ultimate issue” opinions on legal volition; experts speak to impairment and causal plausibility, the jury to responsibility.
- Strict Rule 403 screen for neuroimages and exotic biomarkers; exclude if risk of undue prejudice or misunderstanding outweighs probative value.

4) Jury management and scope
- Limit the excuse to reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Use bifurcation and special interrogatories requiring unanimous findings on each pillar: (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time; (ii) substantial causal contribution from verified RSB exposures; (iii) absence of disqualifiers.
- Provide a fallback: if the excuse fails, the same record may support MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance in homicide or structured mitigation at sentencing.

5) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: incarceration stress, acute sleep loss, and legal anxiety can mimic chronic dyscontrol. Prefer pre‑charge documentation and, where feasible, hair cortisol over single‑day saliva.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity checks; be wary of “too bad to be true” or selective patterns.
- Reverse causation: emphasize pre‑offense school/medical/CPS/EPA records; avoid over‑weighting post‑charge declines.
- Over‑generalization from group data: do not let population correlations substitute for case‑level linkage.
- PCL‑R misuse and cultural bias: use narrowly; avoid stereotyping “subculture” as destiny.

6) Disposition
- If excused, channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma treatment, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep remediation, employment supports), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. This preserves victim protection and public legitimacy.

Bottom line: Santiago’s architecture is directionally sound; Chen rightly trims the sails on specificity and timing. A court can make this administrable by demanding the five‑pillar convergence, neutral expertise, and narrow offense scope. That will confine the excuse to the rare, extreme case where Hart’s fairness limit is truly met, while leaving most RSB evidence to do work where it best belongs—MPC EED and sentencing mitigation.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your evidence hat: if we were to operationalize Prof. Santiago/Dr. Chen’s “convergent bundle” as a pretrial admissibility gate, what would your rule-of-evidence checklist actually allow in and what would it exclude under Daubert (reliability/fit)? Please be concrete: e.g., historic childhood BLLs, geocoded deprivation indices, CPS/school records, SSRT/antisaccade with performance-validity tests—admit or not? Hair cortisol or WCST—too speculative or admissible as supportive only? Would you insist on bifurcation and a clear-and-convincing burden at guilt, or shift most of this to sentencing? In short, draft the narrowest administrable gate you’d be willing to endorse and explain the key error-cost tradeoffs you’re prioritizing.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s core premise: none of these tools can timestamp “loss of control” to the second; they gain probative force only as a convergent bundle tied to a reactive, unplanned event and pre‑offense documentation. The court’s job is to convert that into a governable gate.

What I would require at Stage 2 (clear and convincing), in addition to any Stage 1 eligibility showing:

1) Event‑level signature (the anchor)
- Affective/reactive episode: rapid escalation after a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous indicia of autonomic arousal/dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red,” confusion).
- Corroboration where available (video, 911/body‑cam, neutral witnesses). If there is meaningful planning, concealment, or instrumental motive, the excuse should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (temporality)
- Nonforensic records pre‑dating the offense showing stimulus‑bound outbursts or dissociation (school IEP/discipline, juvenile MH notes, ED visits, prior testing), or a well‑documented trajectory of sleep disruption and affect lability.
- This guards against reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact.”

3) Neurocognitive evidence of impaired inhibition with validity checks
- At least two independent tasks directly taxing inhibition/affect regulation ≥1.5 SD below age‑ and education‑adjusted norms (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with reliable SSRT estimation; antisaccade; affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop). Classic Stroop and WCST can be included but carry less weight; WCST is least specific.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone). Prefer stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence.
- Low psychopathic trait profile (e.g., PCL‑R not in moderate/high range), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptoms and triggers plausibly explaining the index behavior and anchored to exposures shown in Stage 1.
- Physiological corroboration (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated, or a single ≥10; documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia; credible FASD risk). These do not prove momentary impairment but bolster causal plausibility when paired with #3.

Disqualifiers and controls (all must be satisfied)
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering: fail‑safes via multiple validity indices, consistency across sessions, raw‑data disclosure, and collateral informants.
- Alternative primary causes excluded: frank psychosis or mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, clear instrumental motive.
- State–trait controls: standardize testing conditions (sleep, caffeine, meds) and, where feasible, repeat or corroborate; lean heavily on pre‑offense records for temporality.

On the proposed measures’ specificity/temporality
- Inhibition tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go; antisaccade) are the most mechanism‑proximal; they remain state‑sensitive and require careful administration and validity checks.
- Stroop/WCST are non‑specific; admit as part of a broader battery but do not treat as dispositive.
- Cortisol (especially hair segment) indicates chronic load, not momentary state; treat as supportive.
- Historic BLLs are probative if documented during sensitive developmental windows; they say nothing about the instant moment but help explain persistent prefrontal vulnerabilities.
- I would exclude fMRI/QEEG as determinative under Daubert/Rule 702 in this context; at most, background‑educative, not case‑dispositive.

Scientific and forensic pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize; repeat or corroborate; use pre‑charge records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple PVTs, raw‑data production, and neutral review.
- Acute intoxication: do not conflate developmental “toxin history” (lead, FASD) with voluntary substance effects at the time.
- Reverse causation/post‑event artifacts: incarceration and litigation can alter physiology and test effort; prioritize pre‑offense documentation.
- Base‑rate neglect and circularity: many deprived defendants will meet Stage 1 but not Stage 2; deprivation alone is never enough.
- Over‑interpretation of trait measures (e.g., PCL‑R) and cultural essentialism in narrative evidence.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and fairness)
- Pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; require disclosure of raw test data; standardized testing protocols (timing, validity measures).
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) the degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Limit the doctrine to genuinely reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcate; use specialized instructions reminding jurors that severe deprivation, without proven dyscontrol at the moment, is not an excuse (though it may mitigate sentence).
- Funding parity for indigent defendants to avoid skewed access.

Disposition
- Where the excuse is found, favor ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pathways), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.
- In close cases failing Stage 2, channel the record to structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators (lead/malnutrition history, chronic unemployment, housing instability), rather than stretching guilt‑phase doctrine.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 frame is directionally right if courts insist on the five‑pillar convergence above and the disqualifiers. That keeps the gate narrow, honors Hart’s “fair opportunity” limit, and addresses administrability and public‑legitimacy concerns.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming a court admits the dyscontrol excuse to the jury under a Daubert‑screened, clear‑and‑convincing standard, what would your model jury instruction look like to keep the focus tight? Please specify the elements the prosecution must still prove, the elements the defense must prove for the excuse (e.g., reactive, unplanned event; substantial degradation of inhibitory control; substantial causal contribution), and bright‑line disqualifiers (voluntary intoxication, instrumental planning). Also, would you recommend bifurcation of guilt and excuse, or a single unified trial, to manage prejudice and error cost?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s core caution: none of these tools can “time‑stamp” incapacity. They are admissible only as parts of a convergent package that links a well‑documented developmental exposure history to trait‑level inhibitory deficits, and then to an index event with the classic signature of reactive dyscontrol. The law’s fairness limit is momentary: did the defendant lack a fair opportunity to comply at the time? Any framework must keep that focus.

How specific/temporally sensitive are the proposed measures?
- Neurocognitive tasks (best: stop‑signal/go–no‑go, antisaccade; supportive: affective Stroop/Go–No‑Go; weak for our purpose: WCST) assess trait‑level control with modest specificity; results fluctuate with sleep, meds, motivation. They are useful only with robust performance‑validity testing and, ideally, cross‑session/cross‑task convergence.
- Stress/insult markers (childhood BLLs, documented early malnutrition/IDA, FASD risk) strengthen mechanistic plausibility if exposures occurred in sensitive windows. Hair/diurnal cortisol captures chronic load but is nonspecific and state‑sensitive.
- None of these alone proves momentary dyscontrol; their probative value depends on fit with pre‑offense records and the event’s features.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing), with mandatory and optional elements
Mandatory (all three):
1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Seconds–minutes from salient provocation to act; disorganized execution; absence of luring/preparation/concealment. Prefer contemporaneous corroboration (video/body‑cam/911 audio; eyewitness descriptions of “blanking out,” autonomic arousal).

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School/juvenile/clinical records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound explosive reactivity, dissociation, or IED‑like episodes; sleep disruption; not created for litigation.

3) Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, go–no‑go false alarms, antisaccade errors; consider an affective variant). Multiple performance‑validity tests must be passed; replicate or demonstrate cross‑task convergence. Low–moderate psychopathic traits to support an impulsive rather than predatory profile.

Plus at least one of the following two (both preferred):
4) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Childhood blood lead history ≥5 µg/dL (repeated, or a prior ≥10); or documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia; or credible FASD risk. Corroborate with geocoded housing/lead orders, WIC/clinic records.

5) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD–dissociative subtype or Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptom content/trigger profile plausibly explaining the offense. Biological stress indices (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) are supportive but not required.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one should presumptively defeat the excuse):
- Meaningful planning or instrumental motive (weapon staging, luring, pursuit after a cooling interval, concealment).
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the time.
- Malingering/secondary gain indications (failed PVTs; “too bad to be true” patterns).
- Offense outside the doctrine’s domain (planned acquisitive crime). Use MPC‑style EED or sentencing mitigation instead.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Standardize and document sleep, substances, meds; prefer early testing (30–60 days) and rely heavily on pre‑offense records to avoid reverse‑causation artifacts from incarceration stress.
- Ecological validity: WCST is nonspecific; over‑reliance on fMRI/EEG is a known Daubert trap—admit, if at all, only as supportive.
- Norming/bias: Use demographically corrected norms; ensure language/education level do not contaminate results.
- Performance validity: Require multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; consider re‑testing for consistency.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and equity)
- Narrow offense scope: reactive homicides and aggravated assaults; exceptional application to truly impulsive non‑violent offenses.
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a standardized proffer checklist keyed to the elements above; defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Bifurcation and specialized instructions to preserve jury focus.

Model instruction (gist)
“You may find the defendant not guilty by reason of involuntary dyscontrol only if you are convinced that, at the time of the act, his capacity to inhibit an otherwise unlawful assault was substantially eliminated by a reactive state caused by cumulative, documented deprivation‑related insults; that the act followed a salient provocation without meaningful time for reflection; and that the impairment, not voluntary intoxication or planning, was a substantial causal contributor. Trait‑level difficulties alone do not suffice.”

Disposition
Where the excuse is found, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment support) under court supervision; reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

Bottom line
With mandatory event‑level corroboration, pre‑offense history, valid inhibitory deficits, and at least one objective developmental insult or tightly mapped psychiatric linkage—and with strict exclusion of instrumental or intoxication‑driven cases—the attribution can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a very small class of cases. Anything less belongs in MPC §210.3 extreme emotional disturbance or at sentencing, not as a guilt‑phase excuse. This keeps the doctrine morally sound and institutionally governable.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume the court recognizes a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the Santiago/Chen contours. How would you structure the adjudicative architecture to keep it administrable and legitimate? Specifically: outline (i) the pretrial gate (notice, Daubert-style hearing, neutral experts), and (ii) a pattern jury instruction for a bifurcated “excuse phase” that sets the defense’s clear-and-convincing burden and enumerates the elements jurors must find (reactive-event signature, executive-control deficits with validity, exposure biomarker, diagnosis mapping to the event, and exclusion of intoxication/instrumental motive), plus a caution on correlation vs. causation and malingering. Also state which two error-cost risks you would prioritize (false positives vs false negatives) and how that choice would shape the instruction’s language and scope (e.g., confined to reactive violent offenses).

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen’s assessment is scientifically sober and tracks what a court can responsibly admit. From the bench, the problem is translation: build a rule-governed, Daubert-manageable bundle that can support a clear-and-convincing finding of substantial volitional impairment at the moment of offense without inviting overreach.

1) What the tests can and cannot do
- No single instrument time‑stamps loss of control. Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with a defensible SSRT estimate) and antisaccade tasks are the most mechanism‑proximal; Stroop is supportive; WCST is largely peripheral.
- Biomarkers (hair/diurnal cortisol, historic blood lead) are chronic‑state indicators. They help with plausibility and dose–response; they do not prove momentary dyscontrol.
- fMRI/EEG may be admissible only as corroborative; they should never be treated as determinative in an individual case.

2) A court‑usable minimum bundle (clear and convincing) 
Require all three “must‑haves” plus at least one “corroborator,” and confirm the disqualifier screen is clean.

Must‑haves
A. Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of luring/preparation/concealment; contemporaneous indicia of autonomic arousal/dissociation (witness accounts, 911/body‑cam). If the record shows planning or instrumental motive, the defense should presumptively fail.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing episodic explosive reactivity or dissociation (school IEP/discipline, juvenile or ED notes, prior documented rage episodes, sleep disruption). This anchors temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT from Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), administered under standardized conditions and repeated or cross‑validated, with intact performance‑validity indices (e.g., TOMM, MSVT, embedded PVTs). Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) as supportive.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive rather than predatory aggression (avoid overreliance on PCL‑R; if used, low‑to‑moderate scores only and with caution).

At least one corroborator
D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician (CAPS‑5 or equivalent), with symptom content plausibly explaining the index trigger/response. Biological stress markers (flattened hair cortisol over the pre‑offense quarter) are supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent documentation of a biological insult before or during sensitive periods (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

Disqualifier screen (all must be negative or satisfactorily addressed)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (generally defeats the excuse).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the time of offense.
- Malingering/secondary gain (failures on multiple validity tests, profile inconsistency).
- Strong evidence of calculated, instrumental motive (staging, luring, concealment).
- High psychopathic/goal‑directed predation profile.

3) Procedural gatekeeping
- Pretrial Daubert hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Standardized discovery templates for contemporaneous records (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA/HUD, unemployment, geocoded residence histories).
- Testing conditions standardized (sleep, meds, caffeine), with re‑testing or cross‑task convergence to minimize state noise.
- Limit domain: presumptively available only for reactive violent offenses (homicide, aggravated assault) and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts; exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden: defense must prove (i) substantially degraded inhibitory control and (ii) that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act, by clear and convincing evidence.

4) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, custody stress, medication changes can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Prefer hair cortisol covering pre‑offense months; rely heavily on pre‑offense school/medical records; repeat testing where feasible.
- Malingering: Use multiple performance‑validity measures; watch for “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” or selective deficits; ensure effort is adequate.
- Acute intoxication: Distinguish chronic toxin history (lead, FASD) from acute substance effects; voluntary intoxication generally defeats the excuse.
- Reverse causation: Post‑charge stress can produce the very patterns proffered. Pre‑charge documentation is the best antidote.
- Over‑interpretation/technophilia: fMRI activation maps and single‑day salivary cortisol are not specific; hair treatments and ethnicity can confound hair cortisol; WCST deficits should not be treated as inhibition failures.

5) Model instruction (sketch)
“Substantial impairment of volitional control means that, at the time of the offense, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate, provoked response was markedly degraded, such that a person with ordinary self‑control in the defendant’s situation would not have acted as the defendant did. Mere anger, ordinary impulsivity, poverty, or difficult life circumstances are insufficient. The defense fails if the act was planned, goal‑directed, or primarily caused by voluntary intoxication.”

6) Disposition
If established, channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. This protects victims and public safety without the expressive endorsement a justification would imply.

Bottom line
Dr. Chen is right: no silver bullet test; only convergence. A tight bundle—event‑level reactivity, pre‑offense corroboration, valid executive‑control deficits, a plausible psychiatric link, plus at least one objective developmental insult—and a clean set of disqualifiers can carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden in a small slice of cases. With Daubert screening, neutral experts, and narrow offense limits, the doctrine remains administrable and faithful to Hart’s fairness limit while preserving public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle, how would you implement this in a trial court to make it administrable and legitimate? Please be concrete: What should the Daubert‑style proffer look like; who bears what burdens at each step; would you bifurcate guilt from the dyscontrol question; and what limiting instructions would you give the jury (e.g., excluding voluntary intoxication, requiring reactive not instrumental violence)? Also, identify the key error‑cost tradeoffs you’d tolerate (false positives vs. false negatives) and any bright‑line exclusions you’d adopt to prevent mini‑trials on deprivation in routine cases.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Bottom line. None of the Stage 2 tools can, standing alone, time‑stamp a loss of control. Used together, tied to a reactive event signature, and anchored in pre‑offense records, they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow class of cases. Courts should demand true convergence and police the usual forensic hazards.

On the proposed measures
- Neurocognitive tasks. Accept Stop‑Signal (SSRT) and Go/No‑Go as the closest probes of inhibition; add antisaccade and an affective inhibition task (emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop). Downweight WCST (set‑shifting) and treat classic Stroop as supportive only. Require multiple performance‑validity tests and, where feasible, re‑testing for stability.
- Stress/toxin markers. Childhood blood lead (BLL) histories are probative of developmental insult if elevations occurred in sensitive windows; they are not momentary indices. Hair cortisol over a 3‑month segment is more informative than single‑day salivary profiles but remains non‑specific. Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition and FASD risk are corroborative. I would not admit fMRI for attribution; if allowed, it should be clearly labeled as non‑determinative.
- Psychiatric linkage. A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) that plausibly maps triggers and symptoms to the index event is probative; trait psychopathy measures should be used cautiously and only to differentiate reactive from predatory profiles.

Minimum bundle to satisfy clear‑and‑convincing
Require all of the following; no single element suffices:
1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate response to a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/preparation/cover‑up; contemporaneous descriptions (bystanders, 911/body‑cam) of “blanking,” “seeing red,” autonomic arousal. The presence of planning or instrumental motive should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits, documented sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation domains ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT slowing plus antisaccade errors or affective Go/No‑Go), intact effort on embedded and stand‑alone PVTs, and cross‑task or test‑retest convergence. Include an impulsive choice measure (delay discounting) if available.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage
- A structured DSM‑5 diagnosis tied to Stage‑1 exposures and to the index phenomenology; physiological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened 3‑month hair‑cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult
- Independent documentation of at least one biological exposure consistent with the mechanism (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), with a plausible pathway to the measured executive deficits.

6) Exclusions/controls
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; no primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; no acute TBI at the time of offense; no strong evidence of calculated, instrumental aims; multiple validity checks to guard against malingering.

7) Neutral expert concurrence
- Court‑appointed neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental‑health experts opine that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) the degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.

Key scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss, meds, acute legal stress can depress performance and cortisol; standardize testing conditions and, where possible, corroborate with pre‑offense records or repeat testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain. Use multiple PVTs; be wary of selective, “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” deficits and discordant profiles.
- Acute intoxication. Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication should generally defeat a dyscontrol excuse.
- Reverse causation. Post‑offense incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and impair testing; hair cortisol helps with pre‑offense windows; emphasize pre‑charge documentation.
- Base‑rate and measurement error. Require experts to speak in likelihood terms tied to known base rates and error bands; avoid “neurohype.” Cross‑cultural test norms and language effects must be accounted for.
- Over‑interpretation of imaging. fMRI/EEG are not ready for moment‑of‑offense attribution; if admitted, limit to education, not causation.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and legitimacy)
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing keyed to reliability, error rates, standards, and general acceptance; standardized proffer checklists for records (medical labs, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD, UI, geocoded residence history).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts; equal funding for indigent defendants.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and only truly impulsive nonviolent acts in rare cases); bifurcated trial with a tailored instruction distinguishing excuse (no fair opportunity to comply) from justification.
- If the excuse fails, RSB evidence should follow to sentencing mitigation. If it succeeds, dispositions should be ESB‑oriented under court supervision, with civil commitment available where dangerousness is coupled to mental illness.

This keeps the inquiry aligned with Hart’s fairness limit and Fletcher’s attribution, while maintaining a gate tight enough to avoid the floodgates and to preserve public confidence.

### Speaker: Host

Building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions, could you lay out an administrable blueprint for courts? In particular, (a) specify a pretrial gatekeeping protocol (e.g., Daubert hearing structure, neutral expert appointment, offense limitations, and the clear‑and‑convincing burden) that keeps the record tight and avoids mini‑trials; and (b) draft a concise model jury instruction that defines “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause,” with explicit exclusions (e.g., voluntary intoxication, evident planning) to guide jurors. Please be concrete.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen’s bottom line: no single instrument can time‑stamp a loss of control; the only responsible path is convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment. From a courts-and-juries perspective, the question is what bundle of proof clears Rule 702/Daubert and a clear‑and‑convincing standard without turning “bad background” into a generic excuse.

1) What the science can—and cannot—do
- Specificity/temporality: Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go and related tasks index inhibitory capacity but cannot show that inhibition failed at t0; Stroop and WCST add breadth but little time specificity. Hair/diurnal cortisol and historic BLLs speak to chronic load/developmental insult, not momentary state. None should be used as a stand‑alone gateway.
- Reliability/standards: Courts should insist on recognized practice parameters (AACN forensic neuropsych guidelines), multiple performance‑validity tests, lab accreditation for biomarker assays, and published error rates; fMRI should be viewed as demonstrative at most.

2) Minimum converging package I would require (all must be present; any disqualifier below defeats):
A. Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Provoked, rapid escalation; disorganized execution; no luring or concealment; contemporaneous indicia (video/911/body‑cam, witness descriptions of “blanking,” autonomic arousal). Any evidence of planning or instrumental motive should presumptively defeat the excuse.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the incident (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile/clinical notes of dissociation or IED‑type episodes, ED visits tied to rage/sleep disruption). This answers temporality and reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity and affective sensitivity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), replicated or cross‑validated, with intact effort indices (embedded PVTs and stand‑alone measures). Include an impulsive choice metric (delay discounting) if available. Downweight WCST; do not over‑interpret Stroop alone.

D. Psychiatric linkage mapping to the index act
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the trigger/response in the instant offense. Physiologic corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair cortisol over a 3‑month pre‑offense window) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—repeated or a prior ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to present executive deficits.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one defeats the defense):
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at offense.
- High psychopathic/markedly instrumental profile (use PCL‑R cautiously; avoid overreliance given bias concerns).
- Malingering/secondary gain indicators (failed PVTs, inconsistent profiles).
- Testing conducted under uncontrolled acute state influences without replication (sleep deprivation, medication changes) and no corroborative pre‑offense records.

3) Procedural guardrails to keep the gate narrow and even‑handed
- Pretrial Daubert hearing anchored to a structured proffer addressing each element above; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology/psychiatry/environmental health.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates; prioritize pre‑offense records to mitigate “forensic artifact.”
- Restrict applicability to genuinely reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense to show (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants to avoid a doctrine usable only by the well‑resourced.

4) Pitfalls for courts to watch
- State–trait confounds: replicate testing or corroborate with pre‑offense records; standardize sleep/meds/caffeine.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance—hair cortisol and pre‑charge records help.
- Base‑rate/ecological fallacy: high‑deprivation neighborhoods are common; the issue is the defendant’s demonstrable impairment and the index event’s signature, not group correlations.
- Over‑interpretation of “brain scans” or any single metric.

5) Doctrinal placement and jury management
- Where the bundle is met, I would channel it to a tightly cabined dyscontrol/automatism‑like excuse for reactive violence; where it falls short, MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (homicide) or sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators remains appropriate.
- Use bifurcation and special verdict interrogatories to anchor the jury’s finding to the legal standard (“Did defendant prove clearly and convincingly that, at the time of the act, due to cumulative deprivation and documented biological insult, he lacked substantial capacity to inhibit the act in response to the provoking stimulus?”), with an explicit intoxication bar.

Bottom line: The Stage‑2 toolkit, applied as above, can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a narrow band of reactive cases. Anything looser risks sliding from Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without fair opportunity—into an unadministrable sympathy plea.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, focusing on administrability: given Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage eligibility/attribution thresholds and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, please sketch the pretrial gatekeeping protocol you would adopt (Daubert‑style) before a jury ever hears an RSB‑dyscontrol excuse. Concretely, what must the defense proffer (records, expert types, testing timelines, validity checks), what neutral expertise should the court appoint, what exclusions (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication) should be hard stops, and what specific findings should the judge make on the record to ensure the evidence is reliable and that causation meets a clear‑and‑convincing standard? Keep it tight and rule‑governed to minimize mini‑trials and error costs.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Big picture. I agree with Dr. Chen: none of the proposed measures can time‑stamp loss of control. They can, however, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of reactive dyscontrol if, and only if, they converge with strong event‑level evidence and pre‑offense documentation. Courts should treat this as a rare, rule‑governed excuse, not a free‑floating “brain scan” defense.

Are the tools specific/temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective variants) are the closest we have to inhibition assays but are trait‑leaning and state‑sensitive. WCST adds little to the mechanism; “cold” Stroop is modestly probative. They are supportive, not dispositive.
- Stress/insult markers (childhood BLLs, FASD risk, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, hair/diurnal cortisol, HRV) increase causal plausibility; none addresses the instant moment.
- Therefore, the event signature (provocation‑to‑act latency, disorganization, lack of planning, contemporaneous observations) carries the temporal weight; the tests and biomarkers supply mechanism and dose–response.

Minimum bundle I would require (all of the following), with defense bearing clear‑and‑convincing proof:
1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation after a salient trigger; no luring/planning/cover‑up; chaotic execution.
- Corroboration via video/911/body‑cam or credible contemporaneous witness accounts (e.g., “went blank,” autonomic arousal, post‑event disorientation).

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile/ED notes of dissociation/IED‑type episodes, sleep disturbance tied to neighborhood conditions.

3) Validated neurocognitive impairment in inhibition/affect regulation
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two relevant tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and stability/cross‑test convergence. Include an impulsive choice measure (delay discounting) if available.
- Low/moderate psychopathic traits to support a reactive (not predatory) profile.

4) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one insult: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or a prior ≥10); iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk; or documented severe sleep deprivation from environmental conditions (collateral school/medical corroboration).

5) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to the Stage‑1 exposures; symptom pattern plausibly explains the index episode. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

And all of these disqualifiers/controls:
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause (alcohol/stimulants). If present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; generally, intoxication defeats the excuse.
- Exclude primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, or strong instrumental motives (financial gain, revenge planning).
- Guard against malingering: multiple stand‑alone and embedded validity measures; consistency across sessions; collateral informants.
- Timing: testing as early as feasible (within ~60 days) plus reliance on pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Scientific/policy pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol; standardize testing and, where possible, repeat or triangulate.
- Litigation‑driven evidence: be wary of ex post narratives and records; insist on independent, pre‑charge documentation (pediatric labs, school/CPS/EPA/HUD/UID records).
- Over‑interpretation of neuroimaging: fMRI/EEG should be treated, at most, as low‑weight corroboration under Rule 702/Daubert; known error rates and lack of individual diagnostic validity matter.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate bias: population correlations (lead, ACEs) do not establish individual causation; that’s why convergence and temporality are essential.
- Equity/administrability: resource asymmetries can skew access; if the court recognizes the defense, it must provide neutral experts and funding parity or forgo it.

Procedural guardrails I would impose
- Narrow offense domain: presumptively limited to reactive violent offenses; exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Pretrial Daubert/702 hearing tied to a standardized proffer checklist (the five‑pillar bundle above), with court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice requirement and documentary templates; chain‑of‑custody for biological samples; preregistered testing protocols to reduce p‑hacking.
- Jury instruction: emphasize that anger, poverty, or “bad temper” are insufficient; the defense requires substantial degradation of inhibitory control that substantially contributed to the act; mere character evidence is inadmissible; voluntary intoxication negates the excuse.
- Bifurcation and limiting instructions to preserve focus and avoid undue prejudice.

Bottom line. The batteries and markers are not specific or moment‑precise on their own. With the event signature and pre‑offense documentation, plus validated deficits and a documented developmental insult—and with alternatives excluded—they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a small subset of cases. Outside that narrow band, RSB belongs at sentencing as structured mitigation, not at guilt.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as a working template, how would you translate this into courtroom architecture? Specifically: (i) at a Daubert/Frye hearing, which proffered measures would you deem sufficiently reliable and probative (e.g., SSRT/antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go, hair cortisol, childhood BLLs, ACEs, PCL‑R) and which would you presumptively exclude as too speculative or prejudicial (e.g., task‑fMRI, WCST, single‑day salivary cortisol)? (ii) what model jury instruction would you give to tether these data to “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense” without inviting character or poverty‑based nullification? Please also state your preferred burden (clear and convincing?), whether you would bifurcate guilt/excuse, and how you would charge the jury on voluntary intoxication when present alongside RSB exposures.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen has it right on the science: no single assay time‑stamps a loss of control. From a bench-and-evidence perspective, the only way this is governable is through a narrow offense domain and a structured, convergent showing that ties long‑run exposures to a proximate, reactive dyscontrol at the moment.

What I would require (clear and convincing) before a jury ever hears the excuse

1) Event signature (indispensable)
- Acute, salient provocation; seconds-to-minutes escalation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, concealment, or flight planning.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/bodycam or multiple witnesses). If the record shows instrumental planning, the defense stops here.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (indispensable)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile/ED notes of dissociation or intermittent explosive episodes, sleep disruption tied to environment, prior impulse‑driven altercations. This addresses temporality and combats reverse‑causation artifacts.

3) Neurocognitive battery with validity (indispensable and specific)
- At least two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with valid SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop). WCST adds little to inhibition and I would not treat it as core.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone); repeat or cross‑task convergence if initial testing occurs under unstable sleep/medication conditions.
- Trait profile consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression (low–moderate PCL‑R; used cautiously).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event (indispensable)
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom triggers plausibly linked to the incident and anchored in pre‑offense records. Biological stress indices (e.g., 3‑cm hair cortisol) are supportive only.

5) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism (strongly preferred; at least one)
- Historic childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (repeated, or a prior ≥10), documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia, or credible FASD risk—records created independent of litigation. These are not time‑specific, but in the presence of Item 3 deficits they supply causal plausibility.
- Coupled with the Stage‑1 longitudinal deprivation showing (geocoded ADI/ICE, school finance, housing instability), already filtered at eligibility.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; mixed cases require proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Primary psychosis/mania (unless separately excusing), acute TBI at offense, malingering (failed PVTs), or clear instrumental motive.
- Testing conducted and scored under standardized conditions; documentation of sleep/medication status.

Evidentiary and procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert/Kumho hearing keyed to a standardized proffer that walks through the five pillars and the disqualifiers. No pillar, no instruction.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) and “hot‑tubbing” where appropriate to narrow disputes.
- Notice and templates for documentary proof (medical labs, CPS/school records, EPA/HUD lead orders, UI files, geocoded address histories).
- Offense domain: presumptively limited to reactive violent offenses; exceptionally, to truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts. Planned acquisitive crimes are out.

Jury management
- Bifurcation: guilt first; if reached, a specialized instruction on dyscontrol modeled on MPC “substantial capacity to conform,” but framed narrowly: The defendant must prove that, due to cumulative environmental deprivation and its documented effects, his inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of the act and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Limiting instruction: deprivation evidence is not sympathy evidence; it is admitted solely on the dyscontrol question.
- Special interrogatories (yes/no) on each pillar and on disqualifiers to preserve transparency and appellate review.

Scientific pitfalls courts should watch for
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, meds can depress performance and flatten cortisol; favor pre‑offense records and replicate testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple PVTs, cross‑source collateral, and consistency across sessions.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge stress can create the very profiles being proffered; rely on pre‑charge documentation where possible.
- Base‑rate neglect and small effects: population associations (e.g., lead–crime) do not establish case causation; insist on the full convergence.
- Neuro‑glitter: treat fMRI/EEG as demonstratives at most; their forensic increment is minimal compared to validated behavioral tasks and records.
- PCL‑R misuse: do not let a single trait score drive the analysis; it is context‑sensitive and has known limitations.

Disposition
- If the excuse carries, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep, employment), with civil commitment available where lawful for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 frame is directionally sound if trimmed to inhibition‑specific tasks, anchored in pre‑offense documentation, and surrounded by a strict Daubert gate and offense limits. With those guardrails and a clear‑and‑convincing burden on a “substantial contributing cause” standard, the doctrine will remain rare, principled, and administrable.

---

### Speaker: Host

Building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle, please draft a concise model jury instruction for a narrowly tailored dyscontrol excuse. It should: (1) define “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense,” (2) require that such impairment was a substantial contributing cause of the act, (3) assign the defense a clear‑and‑convincing burden, (4) state that voluntary intoxication cannot be the primary driver, (5) make clear that socioeconomic hardship alone is insufficient without objective corroboration, (6) guide jurors on the types of evidence they may consider (pre‑offense records, neurocognitive testing with validity checks, biomarkers, and event‑level features consistent with reactive—not planned—violence), and (7) caution against sympathy or policy views. Keep it in plain language and tight enough to be administrable.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Bottom line. None of the Stage 2 instruments, standing alone, can carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden on “substantial volitional impairment at the time of offense.” Used together, and anchored to pre‑offense records and the event’s phenomenology, they can. The court’s job is to insist on convergence, temporality, and exclusion of better explanations, and to keep the record free of overclaim.

What is probative and what is not
- Most probative, if convergent:
  - Event signature of reactive dyscontrol: seconds-to-minutes escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized, non‑instrumental execution; contemporaneous signs of dissociation/autonomic arousal; no luring, staging, or concealment.
  - Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol: school/juvenile/clinical records predating the offense showing explosive reactivity, dissociation, or IED‑like episodes; sleep disruption documented outside the forensic context.
  - Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity: SSRT on Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, and an affective inhibition task (affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop) ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two tasks; multiple performance‑validity tests passed; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence; low–moderate psychopathic traits (supportive of reactive profile).
  - Psychiatric linkage that maps to the incident: structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to pre‑offense exposures with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index event.
  - Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated, or a prior ≥10), or well‑documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia, or FASD risk—documented in nonforensic records. These are not time‑of‑offense gauges but bolster causal plausibility with the observed executive deficits.

- Supportive but not specific:
  - Stroop classic (without affective stimuli), WCST; useful in a battery but weakly tied to inhibitory breakdown.
  - Diurnal salivary cortisol from a single day; prefer hair cortisol for a pre‑offense 3‑month window if used at all.
  - HRV/startle measures; supportive of affect‑regulation problems, not dispositive.

- Generally inadmissible or to be down‑weighted:
  - fMRI “pattern” testimony for individual responsibility; high risk of Daubert problems, low incremental value beyond clinical and neuropsych data.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)
All of the following, absent a compelling substitute of equal probative value:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol (as above), corroborated where possible by video/911/body‑cam or neutral witnesses.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic records evidencing dyscontrol (school/juvenile/medical) that predate the offense and are consistent with the claimed mechanism.

3) Neurocognitive evidence: ≥2 validated inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD impaired, with intact effort measures and either repeated testing or cross‑task convergence.

4) Psychiatric diagnosis mapping to the event, established by a qualified clinician with structured tools, anchored in Stage‑1 exposures.

5) At least one objective developmental biological insult documented independent of litigation (e.g., historic BLLs, early malnutrition/IDA, FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to current deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls satisfied:
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (routine substance intoxication should defeat the excuse).
- No strong evidence of instrumental planning (luring, weapon staging, concealment).
- Malingering safeguards: multiple performance‑validity tests; consistency across sessions; collateral informants; beware “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Alternative‑cause exclusion: primary psychosis/mania (unless squarely within a different doctrine), acute TBI at the event, clear pecuniary/retaliatory motives unexplained by dyscontrol.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress, and litigation anxiety can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize conditions; prefer repeated testing; give greatest weight to pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge deterioration masquerading as baseline impairment; mitigate with pre‑charge pediatric/school/CPS/EPA records; hair cortisol offers a pre‑offense window.
- Base‑rate/aggregation errors: high adversity is common in the docket; the link must be individualized (mechanism + history + moment), not an ecological inference.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: BLLs and cortisol are plausibility supports, not clocks; experts should not imply second‑by‑second timing.
- Performance validity: require embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; consider retest or alternative tasks if initial results are suspect.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial gatekeeping (Daubert/Frye) with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden; appoint neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Timing: testing within 30–60 days where feasible; heavy reliance on pre‑offense documentation to shore up temporality.
- Offense domain: limit to reactive violent offenses and genuinely impulsive nonviolent acts; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Expert scope: no ultimate‑issue opinions that the defendant “lacked control” at the moment (Rule 704(b)‑type restraint); permit mechanism and impairment testimony with known error rates and peer‑reviewed support.
- Jury instruction (example, for clarity and public legitimacy): “You may consider evidence of cumulative deprivation and developmental insults only if you first find, by clear and convincing evidence, that at the time of the offense the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate, emotionally driven response was substantially impaired, and that this impairment was a substantial contributing cause of the act. Evidence of a difficult background, without such impairment and causal link, is not a defense.”

With these constraints, Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 framework—refined as above—can be applied without inviting floodgates or junk science, and in a way consistent with Hart’s fairness limit and the system’s need for administrable, rule‑governed excuses.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution (with the listed disqualifiers) as the proposed scaffold, do you regard that bundle as sufficient to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard without blowing the gates administratively? If yes, could you sketch (i) a concise pretrial admissibility order (Daubert-style) and (ii) a model jury instruction/verdict form checklist that keeps jurors focused on “reactive dyscontrol” and excludes planned or intoxication-driven offenses? If not, name no more than two additional tightening requirements you would add to protect against error costs and dueling experts.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m largely in the same place as Dr. Chen. None of these instruments time‑stamps volitional failure; they are, at best, trait‑leaning indicators that can support, but never compel, an inference of reactive dyscontrol. If we are to use them at guilt, the law must insist on tight convergence tied to the moment, not just a generalized portrait of adversity.

Are the proposed measures sufficient?
- Standing alone: no. SSRT/Stroop/WCST, cortisol profiles, and historic BLLs lack temporal precision and specificity.
- As a bundle: yes, if (a) the offense bears the “reactive” signature and (b) pre‑offense documentation and valid testing line up with a biologically plausible pathway. Treat WCST as peripheral; stop‑signal/antisaccade/affective Go–No‑Go are closer to the mechanism. Hair cortisol is preferable to single‑day saliva; childhood BLLs are probative if recorded during sensitive windows.

Minimum convergence to meet clear and convincing
I would require all of A–D and at least one of E–F:

A. Event‑level signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/staging/cover‑up; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/bodycam/witnesses) of “blanking,” marked autonomic arousal, or confusion. Any evidence of instrumental planning defeats the claim.

B. Pre‑offense documentation
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school IEPs/discipline for explosive behavior, juvenile mental‑health notes, prior ED visits, chronic sleep disruption). This anchors temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation.

C. Neurocognitive battery with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity indices intact and stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Delay‑discounting can be supportive. Low–moderate PCL‑R (or analogous trait measures) to fit impulsive, not predatory, aggression.

D. Psychiatric linkage
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptom content mapping onto the index trigger and corroborated by pre‑offense records. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective exposure biomarker
- Independent documentation of a developmental insult consistent with prefrontal/affect‑regulation vulnerability (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL on ≥2 occasions or any ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; FASD risk), preferably with geocoded housing/lead orders or clinical labs.

F. Dose–response alignment
- Show gradients: higher exposure severity aligns with greater inhibition deficits and more severe, documented dyscontrol over time.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse; if substances were present, there must be persuasive evidence of baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania/TBI as the driver (unless the theory is a different excuse).
- Robust malingering safeguards (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; consistency checks).
- Testing as early as practicable (60–90 days) and triangulated; heavy reliance on pre‑offense records to avoid forensic artifact.

Scientific/legal pitfalls to watch
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medications, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize test conditions; consider repeat testing; admit hair cortisol cautiously (hair treatments/ethnicity confound).
- Over‑interpretation: fMRI/EEG should be excluded or strictly limited to education; they lack established forensic reliability and inflate prejudicial value.
- Ecological fallacy: neighborhood‑level deprivation proves context, not individual causation; do not let Stage 1 swallow Stage 2.
- Narrative pull/base‑rate neglect: juries overweight compelling life histories; use limiting instructions on what the science can and cannot show.
- Expert shopping/inequality: appoint neutral experts; require standardized proffers.

Administrability guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a standardized checklist (the A–F bundle and exclusions), with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Offense limitation: presumptively confined to reactive interpersonal violence; exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Burden: defense to prove substantial degradation of inhibitory control and substantial causal contribution by clear and convincing evidence.
- Bifurcation and instructions: keep guilt focused on the narrow dyscontrol question; if excused, move to a supervised ESB‑oriented disposition; civil commitment only where statutory criteria (mental illness + danger) are met.

With these conditions, the proposed batteries and markers can do admissible work without turning trials into open‑ended science fairs or eroding the fairness limit Hart articulated. The doctrine will remain narrow—reserved for the small subset where mechanism, history, and moment truly converge.

---

### Speaker: Host

Building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions, could you draft a concise model jury instruction for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse that: (1) clearly frames this as an excuse (not a justification); (2) sets the defense’s clear‑and‑convincing burden on two elements—substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time of the offense and that this degradation was substantially caused by cumulative deprivation with at least one documented biological insult; (3) confines applicability to reactive, unplanned violence; and (4) enumerates disqualifiers (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, evidence of planning, malingering)? Please keep it tight enough to minimize juror confusion and note any key comments you’d give the court to accompany the charge.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen’s cautions are exactly the right starting point: none of these tools time‑stamps loss of control, and each is vulnerable to state noise or forensic artifacts. If courts are to admit Stage‑2 evidence without swamping juries or degrading standards, the gate must insist on convergence and pre‑offense corroboration, and keep the doctrine confined to reactive violence.

What I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold

Domain and burden
- Offense type: confine to affective/reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime, luring, or concealment behavior.
- Burden: clear and convincing proof that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of the act and (ii) the degradation was a substantial contributing cause.

Minimum converging bundle (all of the following)
1) Event signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no preparatory steps or concealment; contemporaneous accounts (witness, audio/video) of dissociation or “seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal. If there is evidence of planning or instrumental motive, the excuse should fail.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic history of dyscontrol
- School, juvenile, medical, or CPS records predating the charge documenting stimulus‑bound explosive episodes, dissociation, or clinically noted impulse‑control failures; ideally multiple settings and observers.

3) Neurocognitive evidence tied to inhibition, with validity checks
- Deficits at least 1.5 SD below norms on two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go SSRT and antisaccade or an affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop).
- Multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests; stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence.
- Downweight WCST; it is too nonspecific.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored in documented exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the incident. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathic trait profile supports a reactive, not predatory, pattern.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent documentation (created before litigation) of at least one biological insult during sensitive periods: childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated, or a prior ≥10), iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk; or verified early‑life sleep disruption from environmental conditions. These do not date the moment but strengthen causal plausibility when paired with current executive deficits.
- Chronic stress corroboration (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not mandatory.

Necessary exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug intoxication as the proximate driver should defeat the excuse; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering: fail the gate if validity testing is suspect or if profiles are “too bad to be true.”
- Alternative drivers: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, or clear instrumental objectives.
- Timing: conduct testing promptly (ideally within 30–60 days) and triangulate with pre‑offense records to mitigate reverse‑causation from post‑arrest stress or incarceration.

Evidentiary/administrability guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a standardized checklist; require defense notice; appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health to reduce “battle of the experts.”
- Discourage showy but low‑probative exhibits (e.g., fMRI “pictures”); admit such imaging, if at all, only as background science with a limiting instruction.
- Use special verdict interrogatories so juries answer discrete questions (e.g., immediacy/absence of planning; presence of dissociation; presence of substantial inhibitory deficit; substantial contribution of documented exposures).
- Jury instruction should track Hart’s fairness limit: “Substantial impairment” means that, in the moment, the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply—not mere anger or ordinary loss of temper.

Scientific pitfalls to watch
- State–trait confounds: sleep loss, medication changes, acute legal stress can depress performance and cortisol; standardize conditions, consider actigraphy/collaterals, and repeat or corroborate testing.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense incarceration can flatten cortisol and affect testing; lean on pre‑charge records and longer‑window biomarkers (hair cortisol) where used.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: neighborhood adversity or a single elevated BLL does not prove dyscontrol absent the rest of the bundle; avoid over‑weighting any one exposure.
- Multiple comparisons/“kitchen‑sink” reports: insist on a priori hypotheses tied to the inhibitory‑control mechanism; penalize fishing expeditions.

Where to cabin this in doctrine
- At guilt: reserve for a narrow involuntary‑rage/automatism‑style excuse in reactive violence when the full bundle is met; in homicide, many close cases are better channeled to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance, which mitigates degree without full exculpation.
- At sentencing: when the bundle falls short, preserve the same evidence for structured mitigation tied to verified deprivation indicators and ESB‑oriented conditions (housing relocation, trauma treatment, nutrition/sleep, jobs), with civil commitment available where a legally recognized mental illness and ongoing dangerousness are shown.

Bottom line
Dr. Chen is right: no single test can carry the day. If courts demand the full, corroborated bundle—and keep the domain tight—Stage‑2 evidence can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of momentary dyscontrol in a small class of cases. Anything looser risks jury confusion, unequal application, and a legitimacy hit that will harm the very communities an RSB avenue is meant to serve.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming we take Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as the scientific substrate, what concrete courtroom architecture would you adopt to make this administrable and legitimate? Please be specific on (i) a pretrial protocol (notice, Daubert hearing, appointment of neutral experts, documentary proffers) and the clear‑and‑convincing allocation; (ii) the offense domain limitation (e.g., reactive violence only) and a tight definition of “substantial impairment of inhibitory control”; and (iii) the exact jury instruction you would give to avoid socio‑economic profiling while tying the excuse to fair‑opportunity doctrine. If you see a simpler, rule‑like surrogate (e.g., a checklist threshold that, if unmet, bars the defense), propose the language and explain the error‑cost tradeoffs.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Attribution tools can assist, but none is temporally precise or specific enough standing alone. I would adopt a narrow, rule‑governed gate that largely tracks Prof. Santiago’s framework, with several judicial refinements to keep it administrable and worthy of the clear‑and‑convincing standard.

1) What these measures can and cannot prove
- Neurocognitive tasks (SSRT/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop): probative of trait‑level inhibitory deficits; not time‑stamped to the offense. Useful only with performance‑validity checks and test–retest or cross‑task convergence.
- Stress/toxin markers (hair/diurnal cortisol; historic BLLs; IDA/malnutrition; FASD risk): increase mechanistic plausibility; they are historical or chronic indicators, not moment‑of‑offense gauges.
- Psychiatric diagnosis (PTSD, IED) via structured instruments: anchors symptoms to exposures; still requires event‑level linkage.
- Bottom line: specificity emerges only from convergence plus an event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol and the absence of instrumental planning.

2) Minimum bundle I would require (all five)
A. Event signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; disorganized execution; no weapon staging or concealment; contemporaneous “went blank/seeing red” descriptions corroborated (video/911/bodycam if available).

B. Pre‑offense documentation
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school IEP/discipline for explosive behavior; prior ED/clinic notes; juvenile records). This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and antisaccade or affective Go–No‑Go), intact effort indices (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs), and stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence. Low–moderate psychopathy scores to fit a reactive (not predatory) profile.

D. Clinical linkage
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, IED) by a qualified clinician, with symptom content that plausibly maps onto the index event. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult
- Independent records of at least one biological insult during sensitive windows (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; clinically documented IDA/malnutrition; prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk), consistent with the neurocognitive pattern.

Disqualifiers (any defeats the excuse)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; clear instrumental/planned motive; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; malingering (failed PVTs); high psychopathy with predatory features.

3) Scientific/legal pitfalls courts must police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol; standardize testing, seek pre‑offense records, consider repetition.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity measures and collateral corroboration.
- Reverse causation: rely on pre‑charge documentation (school/medical/CPS/housing/EPA data) and hair cortisol windows.
- Base‑rate and ecological fallacy: population associations cannot substitute for individual causation without the event‑level fit.
- Neuroimaging gloss: fMRI/EEG should be disfavored (Rule 403) or admitted, if at all, only as general education; they are not specific to volitional control at offense time.

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tied to a standardized checklist; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden on both substantial degradation of inhibitory control and substantial causal contribution to the act.
- Neutral, court‑appointed experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized test batteries and reporting templates.
- Offense limitation: confine to reactive violent offenses (and rare truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcation and instructions: try guilt and excuse separately where possible; instruct the jury that they may not consider deprivation per se, but only whether defendant’s capacity to inhibit was substantially impaired at the time and that impairment was a substantial factor.

5) Disposition
- If established, treat as an excuse akin to involuntary‑act/automatism; default to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision; reserve civil commitment for demonstrably dangerous, mentally disordered individuals. Otherwise, channel RSB evidence to structured sentencing mitigation.

In short, Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 criteria are directionally sound; Dr. Chen is right that timing and specificity come from alignment across history, mechanism, and the moment. With the above bundle and guardrails, courts can admit this evidence without opening the floodgates or eroding public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming a narrowly tailored dyscontrol excuse survives a Daubert-style gate as Prof. Santiago and Dr. Chen envision, please draft a concise pattern jury instruction for the guilt phase. It should: (i) make clear this is an excuse (not a justification); (ii) place a clear-and-convincing burden on the defendant; (iii) define “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” in plain language tied to reactive, unplanned aggression; and (iv) direct the jury that voluntary intoxication cannot be the proximate cause. Keep it tight enough to avoid confusing lay jurors, but specific enough to cabin the doctrine.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage architecture gets the structure right. Stage 2 is where we must be most exacting: no single instrument can time‑stamp a loss of control; the law should demand tight convergence across mechanism, history, and the moment. I would adopt a clear‑and‑convincing standard for this affirmative excuse and require the following minimum bundle; all pillars must be satisfied, with specified disqualifiers.

Required convergence (all five)

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; seconds/minutes, not hours.
- Disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment.
- Contemporaneous observations of dissociation/“seeing red”/autonomic arousal (body‑cam, 911 audio, eyewitnesses). Post‑event confusion/amnesia is supportive but not sufficient.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile mental‑health notes; prior ED visits for rage episodes; documented chronic sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and guards against forensic artifacts.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity, tied to inhibition/affect regulation
- At least two deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on tasks directly indexing inhibitory control/affective interference (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with reliable SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) passed; stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive rather than predatory aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in the high range), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures; symptom triggers plausibly explain the index conduct.
- Physiological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑charge documentation of at least one developmental biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or any ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; documented FASD risk), aligning with the observed executive deficits.

Disqualifiers and exclusions (any one defeats the excuse)
- Proximate voluntary intoxication (alcohol/stimulants) driving the dyscontrol.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to the RSB pathway; acute TBI at offense.
- Strong evidence of instrumental/planned motives or post‑event concealment.
- Malingering: failed performance‑validity tests; “too bad to be true” profiles; lack of cross‑source consistency.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing keyed to a standardized checklist mirroring the pillars above; courts should use Rule 706 neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Testing within ~60–90 days where feasible; heavy reliance on pre‑offense records to mitigate reverse causation. Standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds); repeat or corroborate abnormal findings.
- Strict notice and documentary templates (school/CPS/medical labs, EPA/HUD, UI records; geocoded address history). Chain‑of‑custody and authenticity addressed at the hearing.
- Limit the doctrine presumptively to reactive violent offenses; exclude planned acquisitive crime.

Scientific pitfalls courts should watch for
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol; require standardized conditions and replication/collateral records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: insist on multiple validity indices and cross‑source corroboration.
- Acute intoxication: analytically separate developmental “toxin history” (lead, FASD) from contemporaneous substance effects.
- Reverse causation and forensic artifact: prefer pre‑charge documentation; use hair cortisol (3‑cm segment) over single‑day salivary profiles; treat fMRI/EEG as educational background only, not determinative.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: do not infer individual dyscontrol from group‑level adversity absent the individualized pillars above; avoid over‑weighting WCST (set‑shifting) relative to true inhibition tasks.

Jury instruction (to preserve focus and legitimacy)
- The defense must prove that, at the time of the act, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an impulsive aggressive response was substantially degraded, and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act; severe disadvantage or stress alone does not suffice; voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse.

With these elements and safeguards, Stage 2 evidence becomes probative without turning the guilt phase into a general referendum on poverty. Success will be rare—the top tail of cumulative adversity where mechanism and moment align—addressing moral unfairness while maintaining administrability and public confidence.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as a starting point, how would you translate this into a workable pretrial screen and model jury instruction to keep error costs low and legitimacy high? Please specify: (1) the burden of proof; (2) the exact elements the defense must proffer at a Daubert‑style hearing; (3) categorical exclusions (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, instrumental/planned crimes); (4) how you would structure neutral‑expert participation and funding parity; and (5) a tight instruction that anchors Hart’s “no fair opportunity to comply” to event‑level findings without inviting generalized poverty nullification. Briefly flag the two biggest administrability risks you foresee.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally sound but, as a matter of adjudication, none of the proposed instruments can time‑stamp a loss of control. They are not specific to the index moment and are vulnerable to state noise. They can corroborate; they cannot carry the burden. The gate must be built around the event signature, pre‑offense documentation, and exclusion of better explanations, with the testing and biomarkers as supportive scaffolding.

What the tools can and cannot do
- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with valid SSRT) and antisaccade tasks are the most on‑point probes of inhibitory control; still, they are sensitive to sleep, anxiety, medication, and effort.
- Stroop (especially affective variants) adds some value; WCST is a weak fit for the mechanism and should be down‑weighted.
- Hair/diurnal cortisol are rough markers of chronic stress; single‑day salivary profiles are noisy. Treat as supportive only.
- Historic childhood blood lead (and similar developmental insults) strengthens causal plausibility when elevations occurred during sensitive windows and today’s executive deficits are present. It does not speak to the moment.
- fMRI should not be a linchpin; admissible, if at all, only as background science with careful limiting instructions.

Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard
I would require all of the following; failure on any should defeat the excuse and channel RSB to sentencing:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑instantaneous escalation after a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions (by witnesses, 911, video) of “blanking out,” dissociation, or autonomic surge. Post‑event confusion helps but is not sufficient.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School/juvenile/medical records predating the offense reflecting stimulus‑bound explosive episodes, dissociation, or impulse‑control failures; not records created only after arrest.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Personality profile consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in moderate‑high range), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the offense
- A structured, clinician‑established diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures and with symptom triggers that plausibly explain the index event. Chronic stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult or equivalent corroborator
- Independent records of a biologically plausible insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or any ≥10; documented early malnutrition/IDA; credible FASD risk) that predates and plausibly contributes to the measured executive deficits.

And all of these disqualifiers/exclusions:
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate cause defeats the excuse. Presence of substances shifts the burden to show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Planning/goal‑directed conduct (weapon procurement, luring, concealment) defeats the excuse.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB requires a different doctrine; TBI at the time of offense likewise.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; consistency across time; collateral informants.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, anxiety, medications, pain, pretrial incarceration can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; whenever feasible, repeat; lean on pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑charge stress can alter physiology and cognition. Hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and pre‑charge records mitigate this.
- Base‑rate and extrapolation errors: executive deficits are common among offenders; do not leap from group associations to case‑level causation without the event signature and temporality.
- Culture and norms in testing: ensure appropriate normative data; beware of over‑pathologizing due to educational or linguistic background.
- Expert overclaiming and “shopping”: require full data disclosure, preregistered test batteries where practicable, and neutral, court‑appointed experts.

Administrability guardrails
- Offense domain: confine to truly reactive violence (seconds to minutes), not instrumental crimes. For homicides with a broader emotional backstory, MPC‑style EED is the right doctrinal home; for the rest, RSB belongs at sentencing.
- Procedural posture: pretrial Daubert/Kumho hearing on a structured proffer; defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) volitional control was substantially degraded to the point of automatism or near‑automatism and (ii) that degradation was a substantial factor in the act.
- Evidence hygiene: notice and standardized proffers (school/CPS/medical, EPA/HUD, UI records; geocoded residence history); performance‑validity documentation; contemporaneous event media where available.
- Expert neutrality: appoint a panel (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) with symmetric access to raw data.
- Jury management: bifurcate; give a targeted instruction that RSB may be considered only insofar as it bears on substantial, involuntary impairment of control at the time of offense—not on general character or desert—with special interrogatories on each element.

Error costs and channeling
False positives here carry serious expressive and public‑safety costs, especially for the very communities most victimized by street violence. False negatives can be mitigated by robust, structured RSB mitigation and ESB‑oriented sentences. The gate should be high. In my judgment, only a narrow subset will clear it; most cases with substantial adversity will (and should) be addressed at sentencing with verified deprivation indicators and ESB conditions.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as our working draft, are these demands administrable in real trial courts without devolving into mini‑trials? If not, please specify a pared‑down, rule‑governed template you’d adopt: (i) which measures you would categorically admit or exclude under Daubert/Kumho (e.g., SSRT/Go‑No‑Go, affective Stroop, WCST, hair cortisol, childhood BLLs, fMRI), (ii) a short model instruction defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” that avoids overbreadth, and (iii) any offense/timing limits and burden allocations you would codify to control error costs.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen has it right on the science: none of these measures time‑stamps loss of control; the law will have to rely on convergence and exclusion. If we are to make a dyscontrol excuse administrable and credible, courts should demand a tight, pre‑specified bundle and bar the rest at the gate.

1) What is sufficiently probative
Require all of the following (clear and convincing), with no single item sufficient:

- Event signature (mandatory)
  - Rapid, affective escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized, short‑horizon behavior; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam/witness) of “blanking out,” tremor, tachycardia, or confusion. Any meaningful planning (luring, weapon staging, concealment) defeats the excuse.

- Pre‑offense, nonforensic history (mandatory)
  - Records predating the offense (school discipline/IEPs, juvenile mental‑health notes, ED visits) showing stimulus‑bound explosive reactivity, dissociation, or impulse‑control failures. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

- Objective exposure profile with at least one developmental biological insult (mandatory)
  - Childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or ≥10 once), or documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk; plus longitudinal deprivation (high‑ADI residence, school poverty, housing instability) as Prof. Santiago specified.

- Neurocognitive evidence tied to inhibition, with validity safeguards (mandatory)
  - ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and stability across sessions; low–moderate psychopathic traits (avoid predatory profile).

- Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event (mandatory)
  - Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose triggers and phenomenology plausibly explain the instant act, anchored in pre‑existing records.

Permissive corroborators (supportive, not required): hair cortisol (3‑month window) showing blunting, low resting high‑frequency HRV, sleep actigraphy demonstrating chronic disruption. Historic toxin records (EPA/HUD lead orders) also support.

2) Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; mixed cases require showing baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Malingering: require multiple PVTs, cross‑source consistency, and collateral informants.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI, or strong instrumental motives defeat the excuse.

3) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing (sleep, meds, caffeine), and, where possible, repeat or corroborate with pre‑offense records; incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: weight nonforensic records heavily; hair cortisol helps pre‑offense windows.
- Task specificity: WCST is weak for inhibition; downweight. Stop‑signal/antisaccade/affective tasks are better. Do not over‑interpret Stroop alone.
- Neuroimaging: fMRI/EEG are not dispositive under Daubert; admit, if at all, as demonstrative/educational only.

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability and equality)
- Pretrial Daubert hearing keyed to a structured checklist; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Notice and standardized documentary proffers (medical labs, school/CPS, housing, UI, EPA/HUD; geocoded residence history).
- Timing: testing within 60–90 days post‑offense, with re‑test or cross‑task convergence; heavy reliance on pre‑charge records.
- Offense domain: presumptively limit to reactive violent offenses; exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden: defense bears clear and convincing proof that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Resource parity for indigent defendants, or the doctrine will be illusory and inequitable.

5) Jury instruction (to preserve legitimacy and focus)
Bifurcate where available. If the gate is cleared, instruct that the defense must prove that, because of documented cumulative deprivation including at least one developmental biological insult, the defendant suffered a substantial impairment of inhibitory control, and that at the moment of the offense, in response to a specific provocation, this impairment made compliance with the law not fairly within his capacity—exclusive of voluntary intoxication and apart from planned or instrumental motives.

6) Disposition
If excused, order ESB‑oriented conditions (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep stabilization, employment supports) with close supervision; reserve civil commitment for those who remain dangerous. If the excuse fails but the record is strong, channel to MPC‑style EED in homicide or to structured sentencing mitigation.

Bottom line
The proposed batteries and stress markers are not clocks; they are strands. When—only when—they align with a reactive event signature and pre‑offense documentation, and alternatives are excluded, they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold. Tight gates, neutral experts, and narrow offense coverage are the institutional safeguards that make this morally sound and administrable.

---

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, how would you translate Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage screen and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle into a rule‑governed gate? Please draft—at the level of concrete elements—the pretrial gatekeeping standard you’d adopt (burden, bright‑line exclusions like substantial voluntary intoxication or evidence of planning, required types of corroboration, timing of testing), and specify whether you’d mandate court‑appointed neutral experts. Aim for a checklist a trial judge could actually apply to decide admissibility and scope of any RSB‑dyscontrol instruction.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Short answer. None of the proposed tools (stop‑signal, Stroop, WCST; cortisol; historic BLLs) can, standing alone, time‑stamp a loss of control at the moment of the offense. They are trait‑leaning and probabilistic. They can, however, do probative work within a tightly cabined, convergence model anchored in the event itself. Courts should treat them as supportive of mechanism and plausibility, not as dispositive proof of momentary compulsion.

Specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks: SSRT/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the closest we have to inhibition; Stroop/WCST are broader executive measures. All are vulnerable to state factors (sleep, meds, effort) and do not map to the precise time of offense. Require performance‑validity testing and, ideally, replication or cross‑task convergence.
- Stress markers: Hair/diurnal cortisol index chronic load, not the index moment. Childhood BLLs demonstrate developmental insult to control systems but are historical. Useful to satisfy biological plausibility, not to prove contemporaneous dyscontrol.

Minimum converging bundle (clear and convincing)
I would require all of the following “must‑haves,” plus the disqualifiers:

Must‑haves
1) Event signature and contemporaneous corroboration
- Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; no luring/staging/cover‑up; disorganized execution; contemporaneous observations (video/911/bodycam/witness) of dissociation (“went blank”), marked arousal, or post‑event confusion.

2) Pre‑offense history of reactive dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records (school discipline/IEPs, pediatric/ED notes, juvenile files) documenting stimulus‑bound blowups, dissociation, or explosive reactivity.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below demographically adjusted norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests intact and, if feasible, stability across sessions. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting). Down‑weight WCST; it is not specific.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured clinical diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, tied to documented exposures and with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index event. Low–moderate psychopathy/antisocial trait scores to support a reactive (not predatory) profile.

5) Objective exposure/biological plausibility
- At least one independently documented developmental insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated or any ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; validated FASD risk) or a chronic stress marker (e.g., hair cortisol pattern), used as corroboration rather than a requisite “ticket.”

Disqualifiers/controls (any one defeats the excuse)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver of the act.
- Evidence of planning/instrumental motive (weapon staging, luring, concealment).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the scene.
- Malingering/noncredible effort on testing; inconsistency across sessions.
- Testing conducted so late and under such altered conditions (incarceration stress, medication changes) that state–trait confounds cannot be managed, absent strong pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication effects can depress executive performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize conditions, prefer early testing, and lean heavily on pre‑offense documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple performance‑validity measures and collateral informants; be wary of selective, “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; in general, voluntary intoxication should defeat the excuse even if background RSB increased vulnerability to use.
- Reverse causation/post‑charge artifact: stress from arrest/jail can alter biomarkers and test performance; use hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and historical labs; anchor in records created before litigation.
- Over‑interpretation/“brain image theatre”: fMRI/EEG should be, at most, demonstrative and never the linchpin; known error rates, ecological validity, and 403 concerns (undue prejudice/confusion) counsel caution.
- Measurement bias: use demographically appropriate norms; treat PCL‑R cautiously given known biases and its purpose.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych/psychiatry/environmental health); reciprocal discovery of raw data.
- Limit the domain to genuinely reactive interpersonal violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Jury instruction separating trait risk from momentary compulsion: deficits may inform, but do not establish, an inability to conform; the defense must prove substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time of the act.
- Rule 403 management: time limits on expert testimony; plain‑English explanations; prohibit experts from opining on the ultimate legal conclusion (“unable to conform”).

Bottom line. The Stage 2 tools are probative only as part of a strict convergence model. The “must‑have” bundle above, coupled with firm disqualifiers and gatekeeping, can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a narrow class of cases while preserving jury focus and public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

From the bench perspective, assume we adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution bundle. How would you operationalize this without derailing trials? Please be concrete: (1) pretrial Daubert gatekeeping structure and who bears what burdens; (2) a model, one‑paragraph jury instruction that frames “reactive dyscontrol” as an excuse while clearly excluding voluntary intoxication and planned/instrumental offenses; (3) whether you’d require a special verdict form (e.g., findings on each pillar) and a bifurcated guilt/excuse sequence; and (4) the key error‑cost safeguard you’d build in (e.g., court‑appointed neutral experts, limits on expert headcount, or standardized exposure templates).

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Ellery:

I agree with Prof. Santiago’s basic architecture: Stage 2 must be about proximate, event‑level loss of inhibitory control, proven by converging strands; no single instrument can “time‑stamp” volition. The right way to manage error costs is to (a) confine the doctrine to reactive violence, (b) demand pre‑offense documentation and objective exposures, and (c) use a Daubert/Kumho‑style gate with neutral experts.

On the proposed tools

- Neurocognitive tests. Useful only as part of a battery and only with performance‑validity testing. Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (with a valid SSRT estimate) and antisaccade are the most on‑point for response inhibition; I would downweight WCST (set‑shifting) and treat classic Stroop as supportive at best. An affective task (emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop) is probative because many incidents are affect‑laden. Consider adding a delay‑discounting task as a complementary index of impulsive choice. Require ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures with intact validity indices.
- Stress/exposure markers. Historic childhood BLLs and other developmental insults (iron‑deficiency, malnutrition, documented FASD risk) strengthen plausibility when they precede and align with current deficits. Cortisol measures are noisy; hair cortisol may index chronic load but should be treated as supportive, not dispositive. I would not admit fMRI or glossy brain images as more than background science; they are not case‑specific adjudicators of control.
- Psychiatric linkage. A structured diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) that maps to the index event and is anchored to pre‑offense records is probative; ex post, litigation‑only diagnoses carry less weight.

Minimum bundle to meet clear and convincing

I would require all of the following; failure on any element defeats the excuse:

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Acute, salient trigger; seconds‑to‑minutes escalation; no luring or staged preparation; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions (witnesses, 911/body‑cam/ER notes) of “blanking out,” “seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal, and post‑event confusion. Any evidence of planning, concealment, or instrumental motive should presumptively defeat Stage 2.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes re dissociation/IED, prior ED visits). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation risk.

3) Neurocognitive impairment with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal, antisaccade error rate/latency, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests passed and reasonable stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Include a trait screen to exclude a primarily predatory profile; avoid overreliance on PCL‑R.

4) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑offense documentation of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated, or any ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition markers; documented FASD risk) temporally situated in sensitive periods and plausibly linked to current executive deficits.

5) Psychiatric/physiological linkage
- A structured, clinician‑established trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis whose symptom pattern plausibly explains the index event; biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) may corroborate but are not required.

And all of the following exclusions/safeguards:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, cross‑informant collateral, consistency across time; be alert to “too bad to be true” or selective failures.
- Alternative causes excluded: primary psychosis/mania not traceable to RSB exposures, acute TBI at the scene, clear instrumental motives.
- Timing: testing as early as feasible (ideally within 30–60 days), triangulated with pre‑offense records to avoid incarceration‑induced artifacts.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police

- State–trait confounds. Sleep loss, acute stress, medications, and incarceration can transiently flatten cortisol and degrade test performance. Standardize testing; rely on pre‑offense records; consider actigraphy or collateral sleep documentation where relevant.
- Reverse causation. Post‑charge stress and practice effects can contaminate results; repeat or corroborate findings; prioritize historical records.
- Base‑rate and selection bias. Executive deficits are not rare in forensic samples; the question is whether they substantially degraded control at the moment here.
- Expert shopping and multiple‑comparison fishing. Use court‑appointed neutral experts; require prespecified analysis plans; exclude speculative inferences dressed in neuro‑jargon.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers. fMRI/EEG images have high jury‑persuasion but low case‑specific probative value; admit, if at all, with strict limiting instructions.

Procedural guardrails

- Pretrial Rule 104(a)/Daubert–Kumho hearing tied to a standardized proffer; require the five‑pillar showing above by clear and convincing evidence; appoint neutral neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health experts.
- Offense domain: limit to reactive violent offenses (and, in exceptional cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Jury instruction (sketch). “You may consider evidence that the defendant suffered substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time of the offense. Substantial means more than ordinary anger or stress; it means the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform conduct to law in that moment. General hardship or past adversity alone is not enough. Voluntary intoxication cannot be the proximate cause.”

Where I would channel most cases

- Automatism/involuntary‑rage in the narrow, transient‑dissociation sense—when the event signature and contemporaneous evidence are strong—fits best within established excuse doctrine.
- MPC‑style Extreme Emotional Disturbance in homicide offers a principled, administrable mitigation path that incorporates “the actor’s situation” without inviting neuroscientific overreach.
- For many others, RSB belongs at sentencing with validated mitigation factors (verified deprivation indices, toxin history, trauma), and ESB‑oriented conditions.

Bottom line

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 suite is directionally sound if courts demand the full bundle and police the pitfalls. Event phenomenology and pre‑offense documentation do the heaviest work; neurocognitive and exposure data corroborate mechanism; biomarkers remain supporting actors. With clear‑and‑convincing proof, neutral experts, and a narrow offense domain, we respect Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit without opening the floodgates or slighting victims.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as our working proposal, is this administrable in a trial court without swamping proceedings? If you were charging a jury, what exact instruction and verdict form would you use (e.g., special interrogatories on “reactive event,” “executive deficits with validity,” “exposure biomarker,” and “alternative causes excluded”), and would you require any nonwaivable elements (e.g., pre‑offense records) as a matter of law? Please also specify the Daubert gatekeeping you’d apply (checklist for admissibility, neutral experts, timing), the burden of proof you’d set, and whether you would categorically confine this excuse to reactive interpersonal violence. I’m looking for a concrete, rule‑governed package that preserves jury focus and public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Prof. Santiago’s two‑gate architecture and with Dr. Chen’s core caution: none of these tools time‑stamp loss of control. If we are to keep this administrable and legitimate, Stage 2 must be a narrow conduit: only when mechanism, history, and the moment line up should a jury even hear it.

What I would require before the issue goes to the jury (clear and convincing, at a 702/Daubert pretrial hearing)

A. Event‑level signature (mandatory)
- Rapid, affective escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous observations of dissociation (“blanked out,” “saw red”) or autonomic arousal. Video/911/body‑cam or multiple witnesses strongly preferred.
- Substantial voluntary intoxication at or near the time of the act is disqualifying absent persuasive proof that baseline dyscontrol, not intoxication, was the proximate driver.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (mandatory)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school discipline/IEPs for explosive outbursts, ED visits, juvenile MH notes). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity (mandatory)
- At least two independent deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), administered within 60–90 days, with multiple performance‑validity tests and, where feasible, stability across sessions.
- Downweight WCST; include an impulsive choice measure (delay discounting) if available. Use trait instruments (e.g., PCL‑R) cautiously and only to exclude predatory profiles.

D. Linkage to a qualifying exposure/condition (at least one of the following)
- Developmental biological insult documented independent of litigation (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated, or a peak ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition markers; credible FASD risk), AND a plausible bridge to current executive deficits.
- A DSM‑5 trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established with structured instruments by a qualified clinician, with symptom content that plausibly maps to the index event.

E. Exclusion of better explanations (mandatory)
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, malingering (multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs), and clear instrumental motives.

How I would treat the proposed biomarkers and tests
- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, and affective interference tasks are the best we have for inhibitory control; they are still state‑sensitive and must be corroborated and validity‑screened.
- Hair or multi‑day salivary cortisol: at most supportive of chronic stress; never determinative and easily confounded by incarceration, sleep, meds, hair treatments.
- Historic BLLs are probative of developmental insult but say nothing about the moment; they belong in Stage 1/causal plausibility, not as moment‑of‑offense proof.
- fMRI/advanced imaging: exclude absent strong consensus on forensic validity; the Rule 403 risk of undue weight is high.
- Heart‑rate variability/startle and similar autonomic measures may be admitted as supportive if methodologically sound, but they cannot substitute for A–C above.

Pitfalls courts must police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, legal stress depress performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions and, where feasible, repeat or corroborate with pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: insist on a battery of validity measures; be wary of selective or “too bad to be true” deficits.
- Acute intoxication: alcohol/stimulants commonly degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication should presumptively defeat the excuse.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑charge stress and incarceration can flatten cortisol and impair testing; anchor the case in pre‑charge records and collateral data.
- Overbreadth: do not allow these constructs into planned acquisitive crime; confine the doctrine to reactive violence and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts.

Procedural guardrails
- Notice and structured proffer tied to the checklist above; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health to avoid partisan shopping.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.
- Rule 702/403 gatekeeping: exclude bundles that lack the mandatory prongs; give limiting instructions to prevent the jury from treating deprivation as a justification.

Jury instruction (model)
- “You may consider evidence of dyscontrol only if you find, by clear and convincing evidence, that at the time of the act the defendant experienced an involuntary episode that rendered him unable to inhibit the act. Mere anger, stress, or difficult life circumstances are not sufficient. If you find the episode occurred, you must acquit on this count. If you do not so find, you may consider the same evidence at sentencing in mitigation.”

Disposition
- Where the showing rises to true automatism (involuntary‑rage), acquittal with ESB‑oriented supervision or civil commitment if the person remains dangerous. Where the showing is strong but falls short of automatism, I would channel it to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (homicide) or to sentencing mitigation keyed to verified indicators.

Bottom line
- The minimum “bundle” I would send to a jury is A, B, C, E as mandatory, plus at least one item in D, with no disqualifier present. Anything less stays out under 702/403. This keeps the gate tight, confines the defense to a small class of cases where Hart’s “fair opportunity” is genuinely absent, and preserves public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Dr. Chen has outlined a five‑pillar attribution bundle with disqualifiers (intoxication, malingering, instrumental planning) and emphasized the limits of temporal precision. From an administrability and legitimacy standpoint, could you sketch the concrete courtroom architecture you’d adopt to operationalize a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse? Specifically: (i) what would your pretrial gatekeeping order require under Daubert/Kumho (neutral experts, datasets, validity checks); (ii) would you confine the doctrine to reactive violent offenses as a matter of law; (iii) what model jury instruction would you give to implement a clear‑and‑convincing “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” standard without inviting sympathy verdicts; and (iv) how would you mitigate resource asymmetries so indigent defendants can meet the evidentiary burden without turning every case into a satellite trial on social policy?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen. None of these instruments time‑stamps loss of control. The only way this is administrable is to demand tight convergence between (a) the moment, (b) the mechanism, and (c) pre‑offense history, with clear disqualifiers. Hart’s fairness limit is the touchstone, but we have to control error costs.

On the proposed tools
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with a defensible SSRT estimate) and an antisaccade or flanker variant are the most probative of inhibition. An affective version (emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop) helps tie deficits to hot‑affect triggers. Classic Stroop and WCST are low‑specificity; I would not give them much weight. Include multiple performance‑validity tests and replicate where feasible.
- Stress/exposure markers: Childhood BLLs (especially repeated elevations or any ≥10 µg/dL) and documented malnutrition/iron‑deficiency are probative of developmental hits to prefrontal control. Hair cortisol can corroborate chronic allostatic load but is neither necessary nor sufficient. I would admit fMRI, if at all, only as background education; it cannot carry causation.
- Diagnosis: A structured diagnosis (PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) evaluated by a qualified clinician is supportive when it maps to the index event. But diagnosis is not a proxy for legal incapacity.

What I would require to meet clear and convincing
All of the following, with no single element sufficient:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocateur; seconds/minutes, not hours. No luring, staging, or concealment. Disorganized execution. Contemporaneous sources (911, video, body‑cam, eyewitness) describing dissociation (“went blank/seeing red”), marked autonomic arousal, and post‑event confusion.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, pediatric notes, juvenile mental‑health contacts, prior ED visits) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control. This is the best antidote to reverse causation.

3) Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibitory/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and antisaccade, or SSRT and affective Go–No‑Go), with intact effort indices and either replication or cross‑test convergence. Include a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available. Trait psychopathy in the low/moderate range to fit a reactive, not predatory, profile.

4) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs as above; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; verified prenatal alcohol exposure) that plausibly contributes to current deficits. This is not a moment marker but strengthens causal plausibility.

5) Psychiatric/physiologic linkage that maps to the event
- A structured diagnosis or symptom cluster (e.g., PTSD with dissociation) whose triggers plausibly explain the index offense, plus supportive chronic stress physiology (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) where available.

And all of these disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as the proximate driver defeat the excuse. Historical toxin exposure (lead, FASD) is distinct.
- Planning/instrumentality: evidence of planning, instrumental motive, or concealment defeats the excuse.
- Malingering/forensic artifact: multiple performance‑validity tests; consistency across sessions; collateral informants. Be alert to “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” cognitive profiles and post‑charge symptom inflation.
- Alternative primary explanations: rule out frank psychosis/mania unrelated to the RSB pathway, acute TBI at the scene, or a purely strategic motive.
- Timing: testing as early as practicable; heavy reliance on pre‑offense records to mitigate state effects of incarceration, sleep loss, or acute legal stress.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Sleep deprivation, meds, caffeine, pain, and acute stress can depress performance and cortisol. Standardize and, where possible, repeat testing.
- Measure specificity: WCST and classic Stroop are blunt. Keep the battery anchored to inhibition under affect.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: Hair/salivary cortisol and fMRI are supportive at best. They cannot prove momentary incapacity.
- Norms and equity: Ensure appropriate demographic norms for cognitive tests; avoid importing tools in ways that systemically disadvantage the very populations at issue.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a standardized proffer; appoint neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Require defense notice.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden; require that degraded inhibitory control was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Offense domain limitation: presumptively confined to reactive violent offenses; exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Voluntary intoxication bar; mixed cases require credible evidence of baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Bifurcation and tailored instruction: make plain to the jury this is an excuse (not a justification); they must find that, due to documented dyscontrol, the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform in that moment.

Disposition
Where the excuse is found, I would order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under tight supervision (trauma treatment, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pathways). If the person remains dangerous and meets civil commitment criteria, use that channel; otherwise, conditional release with swift‑revocation authority. Include structured victim input to preserve legitimacy.

Bottom line
Santiago’s Stage 2 architecture is directionally sound if we de‑emphasize nonspecific tasks, resist biomarker overreach, and insist on event‑level corroboration plus pre‑offense documentation. With those constraints, a court can reach “highly likely” in a small subset of cases without opening the floodgates.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two-stage framework and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, focus narrowly on administrability: if you were drafting a standing pretrial gatekeeping order under Rule 104(a)/Daubert for an RSB–dyscontrol excuse, what specific showings would you require (and in what form) before the jury ever hears it? Please specify (i) the minimum documentary proofs you would deem mandatory, (ii) which expert domains must be presented and how you would deploy neutral court-appointed experts, and (iii) the principal exclusionary grounds (e.g., voluntary intoxication, planning indicators). Aim for a concrete checklist-style order that trial judges could apply consistently across cases to control error costs and avoid unequal application.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is the right aspiration: you will never time‑stamp volitional collapse, so you demand aligned signals—history, mechanism, and the moment of offense—while excluding better explanations. Dr. Chen is correct that none of the proposed tools is specific or temporally precise standing alone; the law’s job is to require a convergent, pre‑specified bundle and to cabin the doctrine to cases where that bundle is realistically met.

My administrability takeaways and a workable courtroom rule:

1) Narrow offense domain
- Limit to reactive interpersonal violence (seconds to minutes after an acute trigger). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime and luring/ambush cases.
- Voluntary intoxication that is a proximate driver defeats the excuse.

2) Burden and posture
- Defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden at a pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing and again to the jury.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) for indigent parity and to blunt adversarial “culture shopping.”

3) Minimum converging bundle (all must be met; no single element suffices)
A. Event signature (moment-of-offense)
- Acute provocation followed by near‑immediate escalation; disorganized execution; no preparatory steps or concealment; contemporaneous indicia of autonomic surge/dissociation (“saw red,” blanking, tremor)—ideally corroborated by video/911/bodycam or neutral witnesses.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control: school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, prior ED visits for rage episodes, juvenile mental‑health notes (not created for litigation). This anchors the trait before the offense and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity (mechanism)
- Deficits at least 1.5 SD below norms on two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests intact and cross‑task convergence. Add a delay‑discounting or similar measure as supportive.
- Personality profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the incident (fit)
- Structured clinical diagnosis by a qualified examiner (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented developmental adversity and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response pattern at issue.

E. Objective exposure biomarker (causal plausibility)
- At least one independent, developmental biological insult: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated, or any ≥10); documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; or credible FASD risk. These do not prove momentary loss of control but strengthen the causal chain to prefrontal control deficits.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one defeats or sharply weakens the claim)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication explaining the conduct; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; strong evidence of instrumental planning or profit motive; malingering (failed validity testing); testing conducted only post‑charge with no pre‑offense corroboration.

4) Evidentiary gatekeeping notes (to avoid floodgates and junk science)
- Specify in advance the small menu of accepted tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop) and require reporting of raw scores, norms, and validity indices; require blinding of examiners to case theory where feasible.
- Treat diurnal or hair cortisol, HRV, and fMRI/EEG as supportive only; they are not specific and are vulnerable to state effects. Historic BLLs and pediatric nutrition records are more probative as exposure anchors.
- Require geocoded exposure histories and certified records (EPA/HUD lead orders, WIC/clinic labs, CPS findings, school financing/poverty metrics) to keep Stage 1 from devolving into narrative alone.

5) Jury instruction (to keep focus and legitimacy)
- Tell jurors explicitly: correlation is not enough; the defense must prove that inhibitory control was substantially degraded in this defendant at the time of the act and that this degradation, stemming from documented cumulative exposures, was a substantial contributing cause of the immediate, reactive violence. Not available where the primary driver is voluntary intoxication or where the conduct was planned or instrumental.

Scientific pitfalls courts should be alert to
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, legal stress, medication changes can depress test performance and cortisol; prefer repeated/standardized testing and pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: insist on multiple performance‑validity tests and collateral informants; be wary of selective, “too bad to be true” impairments.
- Reverse causation: incarceration and litigation can flatten cortisol and alter performance; hair cortisol offers a pre‑offense window but is noisy; again, anchor with pediatric/school/medical records.
- Base‑rate neglect and affirming the consequent: many deprived defendants will show some deficits; that does not establish that dyscontrol caused this offense without the event‑level signature and exclusions above.

Disposition (to balance victim protection and fairness)
- Where the excuse is found, order noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision—trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines; reserve civil commitment for those meeting statutory mental‑illness/dangerousness criteria.
- In close cases that do not meet this bundle, channel into MPC‑style EED (homicide) or structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators.

Why this is governable
- Requiring all five pillars plus disqualifier screening, with neutral experts and a narrow offense domain, will make successful invocations rare and principled—largely the “top tail” of cumulative adversity with clear reactive events. It honors Hart’s fairness limit without converting criminal trials into social policy seminars, and it preserves public legitimacy by drawing bright lines where they matter: no excuse for planned crime or voluntary intoxication; relief only when mechanism, history, and moment coherently align.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge, could you translate Prof. Santiago’s and Dr. Chen’s proposals into courtroom architecture? Specifically: what would your pretrial gatekeeping order look like (Daubert/Frye findings, required documentary proffer, neutral expert roles, and disqualifiers like voluntary intoxication or evidence of planning), and what model jury instruction would you give if the case clears the gate, to ensure the jury applies a convergence standard (no single test suffices), distinguishes reactive from instrumental conduct, and finds by clear and convincing evidence that volitional control was substantially degraded and was a substantial contributing cause? Please be concrete about checklists, burdens, and limiting instructions to avoid prejudice, and note any resource‑parity provisions you would order for indigent defendants.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s core caution: none of these instruments can time‑stamp loss of control to the instant. If we are to let such evidence into the culpability box at all, it must come in only as part of a tight, convergent showing that ties mechanism, history, and the moment together. My touchstones are Hart’s fairness limit (no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply) and administrability under Rules 702/703/403 and Daubert.

1) Specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) are the best available probes of inhibitory control but are trait‑leaning, state‑sensitive, and not offense‑moment measures. Useful only as one prong in a bundle and only with performance‑validity testing and, ideally, replication or cross‑battery convergence.
- WCST adds little to the inhibition question; I would downweight or omit it.
- Stress markers:
  - Diurnal salivary cortisol is noisy and readily confounded; hair cortisol is a better chronic index but still nonspecific. Treat as corroborative only.
  - Historic blood lead levels (ideally repeated childhood BLLs or a single level ≥10 µg/dL) are probative of developmental insult if paired with present inhibition deficits; they are not moment indicators.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition records and documented prenatal alcohol exposure are supportive, not dispositive.
- fMRI/EEG: I would presumptively exclude for case‑level attribution (Rule 403/Daubert concerns), admitting only as didactic background where truly necessary.

2) Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
I would require all of the following, with no single element sufficient:

A. Event‑level signature (moment)
- Rapid, affect‑laden escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no credible evidence of luring, weapon staging for this encounter, or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions of dissociation (“went blank/seeing red”), autonomic arousal. Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam audio). If the record shows instrumental planning or calm post‑event manipulation, the excuse should fail.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control or affective lability (school IEPs/discipline for explosive behavior, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption attributed to environmental conditions). This addresses reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact” concerns.

C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity (mechanism)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal reaction time, antisaccade error rate, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), plus a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available; multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests; stability across sessions or cross‑examiner convergence. Low–moderate psychopathic traits (used cautiously) to support a reactive, not predatory, profile.

D. Clinical linkage (mapping the mechanism to the event)
- A structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index incident. Physiological corroboration (hair cortisol flattening, low resting HF‑HRV) is supportive, not required.

E. Objective exposure biomarker (developmental plausibility)
- At least one independently documented biological insult consistent with impaired frontal control (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated, or ≥10 once; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) tied to the developmental window, plus Stage‑1 environmental records (lead hazard notices, housing/ADI, school deprivation).

And all of these exclusions/safeguards:
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering: multiple PVTs, internal consistency, collateral informants. Watch for selective, “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” patterns.
- Primary alternative causes: rule out frank psychosis/mania (unless proceeding under insanity), acute TBI at the scene, clear instrumental motive/gain.
- Testing timing: administer early (ideally within 30–60 days), standardize for sleep/meds/caffeine, and lean on pre‑offense records to mitigate incarceration‑induced changes.

3) Scientific/legal pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: executive performance and cortisol fluctuate with sleep, pain, meds, acute legal stress. Use standardized protocols; prefer replication; weigh historical records heavily.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: neighborhood/poverty correlations do not establish individual causation. Demand individual biomarkers/history and event fit.
- Adversarial allegiance and p‑hacking: appoint neutral experts; require pre‑specified analytic plans and transparent data.
- Reverse causation: incarceration and litigation stress can produce the very profiles offered. Hair cortisol (pre‑offense segment), pre‑charge school/medical records, and early testing help.
- Overbreadth/jury confusion: avoid turning guilt into a referendum on social injustice. Use limiting instructions; keep the proof focused on volitional capacity at the time.

4) Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing keyed to a standardized checklist (the bundle above).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; parity funding for indigent defendants.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; confine applicability to reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, to truly impulsive nonviolent acts), presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions: separate guilt from excuse; instruct that “anger, hardship, or bad judgment” is insufficient—there must be substantial degradation of inhibitory control proximately causing the act.

This bundle is stricter than ordinary mitigation but is the right discipline if we are to keep the doctrine rare, honest, and administrable. In practice, only a small subset of reactive violent cases will clear this bar. For the many cases that present serious deprivation without the necessary moment‑level linkage, the right home remains sentencing mitigation—with validated deprivation indicators and ESB‑oriented conditions—rather than an excuse at guilt.

---

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability standpoint, assume we recognize a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the lines Prof. Santiago outlined and Dr. Chen refined. Could you draft the core of a model jury instruction that (i) defines “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” at the time of the offense; (ii) specifies the limiting principles (reactive, unplanned violence; exclusion for voluntary intoxication and instrumental motives); (iii) states the defense’s clear‑and‑convincing burden; and (iv) identifies the kinds of evidence the jury may consider without turning this into a free‑floating “bad environment” mitigation? Keep it tight and trial‑usable, and flag any phrasing that, in your view, would reduce error costs on appeal.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Two reactions, one normative, one institutional.

1) The normative core. Hart’s fairness limit remains the lodestar: we do not punish where the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply. On that view, Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage screen, as tightened by Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution, is the right shape: it operationalizes “no fair opportunity” as (a) severe, verified formative deprivation with at least one biologically plausible insult and (b) a proximate, reactive loss of inhibitory control at the moment of offense. That keeps us in the excuse family; it is not a license to re‑price structural injustice at guilt.

2) The institutional design. If we are to administer this without losing the jury or the public, we need crisp, rule‑governed gates, narrow offense coverage, and disciplined instructions. Here is how I would structure it.

A. Offense domain and burdens
- Domain: reactive interpersonal violence (e.g., sudden assaults, homicides) following acute provocation, with minimal planning. Presumptive exclusion of planned acquisitive crimes and calculated retaliation. In close cases, resolve domain questions at a pretrial hearing.
- Two channels only:
  (i) Involuntary‑rage automatism (complete excuse): tightly limited to brief dissociative episodes amounting to unconscious or non‑volitional conduct. If proven, verdict is Not Guilty by Reason of Involuntary Rage (NGRIR).
  (ii) MPC‑style Extreme Emotional Disturbance (EED) in homicide (partial excuse): reduces murder to manslaughter when the defendant acted under extreme disturbance with a reasonable explanation from the viewpoint of one in the actor’s situation. For non‑homicide violent offenses, treat comparable evidence as a structured mitigator at sentencing, not a guilt defense.
- Burden/standard: Defense bears clear and convincing evidence for either channel. The state retains BARD on all elements.

B. Evidentiary threshold (minimum bundle)
Require convergence across the following; no single item suffices.

Stage 1: Eligibility (mechanistic plausibility)
1) Documented cumulative deprivation (≥2):
   - Childhood residence ≥8/18 years in top‑decile deprivation tracts with high violent‑crime exposure; and/or
   - Schools in bottom quintile per‑pupil spending/≥75% FRL; and/or
   - Housing instability (evictions/shelter) or caregiver labor instability (UI records); and/or
   - Corroborated early adversity (CPS‑substantiated abuse/neglect, caregiver incarceration, witnessed serious violence) or validated ACEs/PTSD screening.
2) At least one developmental biological insult:
   - Childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or any ≥10); or
   - Iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition documented in medical/WIC records; or
   - Prenatal alcohol/drug exposure consistent with FASD risk; or
   - Chronic sleep disruption supported by collateral records (school truancy/discipline; where feasible, actigraphy/sleep clinic).

Stage 2: Case‑level attribution (proximate dyscontrol)
3) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol:
   - Near‑immediate escalation after salient trigger; disorganized execution; absence of luring/preparation/concealment; contemporaneous witness/video/911/bodycam descriptions of “blanking out,” autonomic arousal. Planning or instrumental motive is a strong defeater.
4) Neurocognitive profile with validity:
   - ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go/antisaccade/affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity tests and, ideally, cross‑session stability; low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits consistent with impulsive rather than predatory aggression.
5) Psychiatric/physiological linkage:
   - Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom timing and content plausibly map onto the incident; supportive chronic stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol) or historic BLLs are admissible as support, not determinative.
6) Temporality and dose–response:
   - Non‑forensic, pre‑offense records (school IEP/discipline, juvenile MH notes, prior ED visits) evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol; severity of exposures tracks the measured deficits.
7) Exclusions/controls:
   - Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; malingering screened with multiple PVTs and collateral checks; rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI, or clear instrumental motives.

C. Gatekeeping and equality of arms
- Mandatory pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health), with party experts permitted; standardized templates for documentary proof (medical labs, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD, UI; geocoded residence histories).
- Notice requirement (e.g., 60–90 days) to avoid trial by ambush.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will be selectively available and illegitimate.

D. Jury management and instructions
- Bifurcate when practicable. Phase 1: elements. Phase 2: excuse.
- Use special interrogatories in Phase 2 to keep the jury on task:
  1) Has the defendant proven by clear and convincing evidence that at the time of the offense his/her inhibitory control was substantially degraded?
  2) Has the defendant proven that the degradation was substantially caused by the cumulative exposures and insult(s) established in Stage 1 and that it proximately produced a reactive act?
- For homicide, provide MPC §210.3 EED instruction as an alternative if automatism fails but disturbance is established; for non‑homicide violence, direct the jury that similar evidence will be considered at sentencing and should not be used to nullify.

E. Disposition
- NGRIR (automatism): dispositional hearing. If dangerous and mentally ill, civil commitment under existing standards. If dangerous but not meetable under civil commitment, impose an ESB‑supervised conditional release plan (housing relocation, trauma‑focused therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines), with graduated liberty and judicial review. Victim‑safety conditions and no‑contact orders are mandatory; violations return the matter to court.
- EED manslaughter or violent offense with RSB mitigation: codify RSB as an enumerated mitigator in guidelines with verified indicators (e.g., documented lead exposure, chronic unemployment tied to macro shocks, CPS‑substantiated adversity), cap and explain departures, and require written findings for appellate review.

F. What to avoid
- “Societal fault” apportionment at guilt. As attractive as comparative negligence sounds, it is administratively unworkable in criminal adjudication and risks expressive harm. Keep the moral arithmetic of societal failure in sentencing and in noncriminal policy (jobs, school finance, lead abatement).
- RSB as justification. We should not tell victims that interpersonal violence was “the right thing to do.” The only complete excuse here is the narrow automatism/dissociation case.

Scientific cautions the bench should enforce (echoing Dr. Chen)
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing conditions; privilege pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity checks; watch for selective, “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: keep it out as a proximate cause; distinguish historic toxin exposure from same‑day substance use.
- Over‑claiming from biomarkers: fMRI/EEG have no place as proof of moment‑of‑offense dyscontrol; admit such evidence, if at all, only to support mechanistic plausibility already shown by stronger anchors.

Why this won’t flood the courts
With these gates, only a small fraction of violent cases will reach a hearing; fewer will satisfy the full bundle. Most RSB evidence will continue to do its proper work at sentencing. That preserves deterrence and respects victims, while honoring Hart’s fairness limit in the rare case where mechanism and moment truly align.

Finally, a word about legitimacy. Jurors and victims will accept narrow, rule‑bound avenues—automatism in tightly defined circumstances; EED in homicide; and verified RSB mitigation at sentencing—especially if dispositions are ESB‑oriented, safety‑conscious, and subject to review. That is the administrable middle course between Bazelon’s moral critique and Morse’s caution.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle into courtroom practice? Specifically: (1) what admissibility standard and Daubert-style protocol would you use (neutral court experts, required records, timing) to keep state–trait confounds and malingering in check; (2) what minimum “bundle” would you deem sufficient under a clear-and-convincing burden (please be concrete about which pillars are mandatory and which are supportive); (3) how would you draft a tight jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense,” and list categorical disqualifiers (e.g., voluntary intoxication, instrumental planning); and (4) to preserve administrability and legitimacy, would you confine this excuse to reactive violent offenses and require bifurcation? If so, outline the sequencing and verdict options you’d authorize (e.g., full acquittal with ESB conditions, partial mitigation).

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

Bottom line. None of the Stage‑2 tools (SSRT/Go–No‑Go, Stroop, WCST; cortisol; historic BLLs) is, alone, specific or time‑resolved enough to prove loss of control at the moment of offense. A court can, however, permit a dyscontrol excuse on a clear‑and‑convincing showing built from converging strands that line up mechanism, history, and the event, with tight gatekeeping and exclusions.

Evidentiary gatekeeping (pretrial)
- Daubert/Rule 702 hearing (or state analogue) with a structured proffer tied to predefined elements; appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Standardized operating protocols for testing (sleep/medication controls; multiple performance‑validity tests; replication or cross‑task convergence).
- 403 screening to exclude glamor evidence (e.g., fMRI) with minimal probative value and high prejudice.

Minimum convergence required (all must be present)
1) Event‑level reactive profile
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of planning/cover‑up; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/witness) of “seeing red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal.
- Presumptively fails if there was luring, weapon staging, post‑event instrumental conduct.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol and adversity
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, prior ED visits, juvenile notes of dissociation/IED) plus objective exposure records from Stage 1 (e.g., CPS, HUD/EPA, pediatric BLLs).

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity and replication
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal/SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity indices and either repeat testing consistency or cross‑test convergence; adjust for IQ/education and cultural‑linguistic norms.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive, not predatory aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

4) Clinical diagnosis that maps to the index event
- Structured assessment (e.g., CAPS‑5/SCID) supporting PTSD (dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder, with symptom triggers plausibly linked to the offense and anchored in pre‑offense history.

5) Objective biological insult consistent with mechanism (developmental, not acute)
- Childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or peak ≥10), or documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia, or prenatal alcohol exposure; these are not time stamps but strengthen causal plausibility when paired with #3.
- Chronic stress physiology (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol over 3 months) is supportive, not determinative.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; mixed cases require showing baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless separately pled), acute TBI at offense, malingering (multiple PVTs, collateral verification).
- Testing as early as feasible (ideally ≤60–90 days) and reliance on pre‑offense records to mitigate reverse‑causation from incarceration stress.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, pain, legal stress can depress performance and cortisol; standardize and, where possible, replicate.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multi‑method validity checks; beware selective/extreme deficits inconsistent with day‑to‑day functioning.
- Acute intoxication: do not conflate developmental “toxin history” (lead, FASD) with alcohol/drug effects at the time.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense stress can flatten cortisol; hair cortisol and pre‑charge medical/school records are better anchors.
- Test‑norm issues: ensure culturally appropriate norms; avoid over‑reliance on WCST (poor specificity). HRV/startle and fMRI are, at best, auxiliary.
- Base‑rate neglect and “neurorealism”: biomarkers are probabilistic; require linkage to event features and pre‑offense history.

Narrow domain and burden
- Limit to reactive violent offenses (and exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Jury instruction (sketch)
- You may consider dyscontrol evidence only if you find both (a) substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense and (b) that such impairment, stemming from documented environmental insults, was a substantial contributing cause; probabilistic biomarkers alone do not suffice; voluntary intoxication defeats the defense.

Disposition
- If established, channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions with risk‑management; civil commitment remains available where legally permissible for continuing dangerousness.

This package keeps the gate narrow, aligns with Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit, and addresses administrability and error‑cost concerns while giving genuine dyscontrol cases a defensible avenue.

---

### Speaker: Host

Building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions, design the admissibility gate from the bench’s perspective: what should a pretrial (Daubert‑style) proffer and judicial findings require before the jury ever hears an RSB‑dyscontrol excuse? Please specify (i) the documentary checklist you’d demand (exposure records, timing of testing, validity indices, toxicology), (ii) whether to use court‑appointed neutral experts and how to cabin partisan experts, (iii) the burden of proof you’d impose at the gate (preponderance vs clear‑and‑convincing) and why, and (iv) model language for a limiting order and a short, plain‑English jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and excluding voluntary intoxication and planned, instrumental conduct. Keep it operational and tightly rule‑governed to address floodgates/legitimacy concerns.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I agree with Dr. Chen’s core caution: none of these instruments can time‑stamp loss of control at T=0. They are, at best, supportive evidence that makes a reactive‑dyscontrol account more or less credible. If we are to use them at guilt, the court must demand convergence across history, mechanism, and the event, with tight gatekeeping under Rule 702/Daubert and a high burden on the defense.

On specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) index trait‑level inhibitory control and affective interference; they are not specific to RSB nor temporally precise. Useful only if paired with pre‑offense documentation and an event signature of reactivity. WCST adds little to the mechanism at issue and should be down‑weighted.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) capture chronic load with noise; historic BLLs are developmentally probative but not dispositive for the instant offense. fMRI should, in my view, be excluded at guilt or admitted only as demonstrative; it lacks person‑specific diagnostic validity and fit.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing (all required)
1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Acute provocation-to-act interval measured in seconds or a very few minutes; no weapon staging, luring, or disguise; disorganized execution; contemporaneous evidence (video/911/bodycam or multiple neutral witnesses) of “red‑out,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal. Any meaningful planning or cooling‑off defeats the excuse (those are §210.3/EED cases at most).

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School/medical/juvenile records predating the offense showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (IEPs, ED notes, prior explosive episodes), sleep disruption, or trauma symptoms. This anchors temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neuropsychological convergence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below age‑norms (e.g., SSRT prolongation, antisaccade errors, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), administered within 30–60 days, with repeat or cross‑test stability and multiple performance‑validity tests passed. Include a delay‑discounting or similar impulsive‑choice measure. Avoid overreliance on WCST. Use PCL‑R, if at all, cautiously and only to exclude predatory profiles.

4) Clinical diagnosis that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, linked to documented exposures and with trigger/symptom content plausibly explaining the instant act. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol) may support but is not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation records of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a peak ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk), with a dose–response story that coheres with current inhibitory deficits.

And all of the following exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver disqualifies; low‑level presence requires showing baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded/stand‑alone PVTs; internal consistency; collateral informants; avoid “forensic artifact” profiles.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time, and clear instrumental motives.
- Testing conditions standardized (sleep, meds, caffeine), with chain‑of‑custody for biological assays and accredited labs; neutral court‑appointed experts to reduce partisanship.

Judicial gatekeeping/administrability
- Pretrial Daubert hearing keyed to the elements above; require the defense to proffer documentary proof and specify how each item “fits” the moment‑of‑offense impairment (not merely generalized adversity).
- Limit the doctrine to truly reactive violent offenses; channel borderline or delayed‑reaction fact patterns to MPC §210.3 (EED) mitigation rather than full excuse.
- Provide a tight instruction: the jury must find that, due to proven RSB‑linked deficits, defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate violent response was so substantially degraded at the time that compliance was not a fair expectation; mere anger, humiliation, or difficult circumstances are insufficient.

Pitfalls the court should police
- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, incarceration stress) depressing test performance; rely on pre‑offense records and, where feasible, repeat testing.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers and neuroimaging; insist on peer‑reviewed validity, known error rates, and “fit” to the legal question.
- Base‑rate blindness: many people with similar exposures do not offend; thus, event‑level and pre‑offense individualization are essential.
- Equity: without funding parity and neutral experts, application will be disparate; courts should ensure resources for indigent defendants.

Error‑cost posture
Given the expressive stakes and victim protection, set the bar high to minimize false positives (excusing the culpable). Cases that fall short should still be heard at sentencing as mitigation. Where the excuse is found, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under supervision (and civil commitment for those who remain dangerous) preserve public safety and legitimacy while honoring Hart’s fairness limit.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming we adopt a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the Santiago/Chen lines, how would you operationalize it in the courtroom? Please draft (i) a concise model jury instruction that states the elements, burden (if you think clear-and-convincing is right), limiting language (reactive violence only; intoxication disqualifier; no planned crime), and required convergence of evidence; and (ii) a pretrial gatekeeping order (Daubert-style) specifying admissibility of neurocognitive and biomarker evidence (e.g., hair cortisol, childhood BLLs), timelines for testing, and use of neutral experts—so jurors aren’t overwhelmed and the standard is administrable and even-handed.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Two points up front. First, none of these instruments time‑stamp volitional failure; they are, at best, probabilistic lenses. Second, if we are to use them at guilt, courts must insist on tight convergence tied to the event and exclude high‑noise, high‑prejudice evidence. Otherwise, this belongs at sentencing.

On Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 criteria

- Neurocognitive tasks. Stop‑Signal (SSRT), Go/No‑Go, antisaccade, and affective variants (emotional Stroop/Go‑No‑Go) are the right family for inhibitory control; WCST is too nonspecific and should be down‑weighted or dropped. All testing needs embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests and, ideally, replication or cross‑task convergence. Results are state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation) and should be interpreted accordingly.

- Stress/insult markers. Historic blood‑lead (childhood BLLs from certified labs) are probative of developmental insult if they predate the offense; they don’t speak to the moment. Hair cortisol provides a 2–3‑month window for chronic load; single‑day salivary profiles are noisy. These are corroborative, not dispositive.

- Psychiatric linkage. A structured diagnosis (PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified, court‑appointed examiner can bridge history to mechanism, but content/timing must plausibly map onto the index event. PCL‑R should be used cautiously, if at all, given construct and bias concerns; we are screening out predation, not branding.

Minimum bundle for clear and convincing

I would require all of the following; absence of any one defeats the excuse:

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; no luring or cooling‑off; disorganized execution; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam/witness) of dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”) or marked autonomic arousal. Any meaningful planning/cover‑up is disqualifying.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School/juvenile/clinical records predating the offense showing episodic stimulus‑bound loss of control, sleep disruption, or prior rage/dissociation episodes. This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation.

3) Valid neurocognitive evidence of impaired inhibition
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with intact performance validity and either replication or cross‑test convergence. Include an impulsive‑choice measure (delay discounting) if available.

4) Psychiatric diagnosis that fits the event
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis (PTSD/IED) with symptom triggers that plausibly explain the index conduct, established by a neutral expert and anchored to Stage‑1 exposures; biological stress markers supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated, or ≥10 once; FASD risk; documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia) that plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

And all of these exclusions/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, cross‑informant collateral, consistency across sessions.
- Alternative causes excluded: primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, strong instrumental motive.
- Testing conditions standardized (sleep/meds/caffeine) and conducted promptly (preferably within 30–60 days), with heavy weight on pre‑offense records.

Scientific/legal pitfalls for courts

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, and medication changes depress performance and flatten cortisol; insist on standardized conditions, replication, and reliance on pre‑charge documentation.

- Malingering and coaching: require multiple validity indices and neutral examiners; beware “too bad to be true” profiles or selective impairment on feignable tasks.

- Acute intoxication: common confound that mimics dyscontrol; treat as a disqualifier absent persuasive evidence of baseline impairment.

- Reverse causation: post‑offense stress can produce the very biomarkers offered; hair cortisol helps but is imperfect. Pre‑offense school/medical/environmental records are the antidote.

- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: group‑level associations (lead, ACEs) do not excuse individuals; demand individual‑level mechanisms tied to the moment.

- Neuro‑realism/prejudice (Rule 403): colorful brain images (fMRI) carry outsized persuasive force with limited probative value; I would generally exclude fMRI at guilt. Keep the science text‑and‑tables, not pictures.

Procedural guardrails

- Daubert‑style pretrial hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized documentary templates (BLLs, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD, unemployment records; geocoded residence histories).

- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; narrow offense domain (reactive violence; truly impulsive nonviolent offenses only in exceptional cases).

- Pattern jury instruction: risk factors alone do not excuse; the question is substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time.

- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine skews unjustly.

Bottom line

Even with these gates, only a narrow slice of cases will (and should) qualify at guilt. Where the convergence falls short, the same materials ought to be heard at sentencing under structured mitigation. And I would keep a separate, even narrower path for true automatism/“involuntary rage” with contemporaneous corroboration, and for MPC‑style EED in homicide—both more administrable than a broad dyscontrol excuse.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming we adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage eligibility/attribution and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence, from an administrability and error‑cost perspective what should a pretrial gatekeeping order (Daubert‑style) require the court to find before the jury may hear an RSB‑dyscontrol excuse? Please specify: (i) the threshold findings the judge must make as a matter of law; (ii) the categories of evidence admissible at this stage (and any bright‑line exclusions, e.g., voluntary intoxication, speculative neuroimaging); and (iii) a concise model jury instruction defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” if the case proceeds past the gate.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

The science can assist, but it will not time‑stamp loss of control to the second. If courts are to use it without sacrificing administrability or legitimacy, we should tether any dyscontrol excuse to (i) reactive, unplanned violence; (ii) pre‑offense documentation; and (iii) a convergent, neutral‑expert record that makes “no fair opportunity to comply” more likely than not—and, given the stakes, I would require clear and convincing proof.

On Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2: as Dr. Chen said, none of the proposed tools is specific or temporally precise in isolation. As a bundle, they can support an inference of substantial volitional impairment at the moment—provided we demand alignment across history, mechanism, and the event, and exclude common confounds. I would translate this into a court‑usable gate as follows.

Eligibility: offense domain and disqualifiers
- Limit to affective/reactive violence (seconds or minutes after a salient provocation). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime, luring, weapon staging, or concealment.
- Disqualify where substantial voluntary intoxication was the proximate driver; where malingering or strong instrumental motive is shown; or where primary psychosis/mania better explains conduct.

Minimum convergence (clear‑and‑convincing)
Require all five pillars below. No single pillar suffices.

1) Event signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a concrete trigger; disorganized execution; no cover‑up; contemporaneous descriptions (e.g., “saw red,” “blanked out,” shaking, tachycardia). Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam audio).

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control: school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, documented chronic sleep disruption. This addresses temporality and reduces “forensic artifact” concerns.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity safeguards
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks directly tied to the mechanism (e.g., Stop‑Signal Reaction Time, Go/No‑Go, antisaccade; include an affective variant such as emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop). Include delay discounting if available.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and, where feasible, repeat or cross‑test corroboration.
- Low to moderate psychopathic traits (use PCL‑R cautiously) to support impulsive/reactive rather than predatory aggression.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptom timing and content plausibly explaining the offense trigger and dissociation.
- Supportive (not determinative) chronic stress markers: hair cortisol flattening or low resting high‑frequency HRV, interpreted cautiously.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one biologically plausible exposure (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk), plus a plausible link to current executive deficits.

Procedural guardrails (to keep error costs down)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a standardized checklist; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; ensure funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Testing standardized and as early as practicable (ideally within 30–60 days), with attention to sleep, meds, caffeine; rely heavily on pre‑offense records.
- Limit (or exclude) research‑grade neuroimaging (fMRI) as evidence of mechanism; admit only if the jurisdiction is satisfied that reliability and error rates meet Daubert.

Scientific pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and legal stress can depress executive performance and cortisol; mitigate with standardization and replication, and prefer pre‑offense documentation.
- Malingering: require multiple validity measures; be wary of selective, “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication should generally defeat the excuse.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and degrade performance; hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and pre‑charge records help.

Two doctrinal channels (to preserve coherence)
- Track A—Automatism/involuntary‑rage: For the rare case where the five pillars are strong and the event signature shows a transient dissociative state, treat as automatism (voluntariness under MPC §2.01), with an acquittal and a structured ESB disposition or, if mentally ill and dangerous, civil commitment. This aligns with Hart’s fairness limit without creating a roving “RSB defense.”
- Track B—Mitigation: Where the record shows substantial, but not total, impairment, channel to existing doctrines: MPC §210.3 extreme emotional disturbance in homicide; diminished capacity where recognized; and, at minimum, structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation and exposure indicators. This preserves jury focus and public legitimacy while recognizing reduced blameworthiness.

Jury instruction (illustrative)
“If you find by clear and convincing evidence that, due to documented developmental insults and chronic stress, the defendant underwent a transient episode at the time of the act in which inhibitory control was substantially eliminated, such that the act was not the product of a conscious exercise of choice, you must find the act involuntary. If you instead find that inhibitory control was substantially impaired but not eliminated, you may consider that impairment in determining intent (or, in homicide, whether the killing occurred under extreme emotional disturbance), and you must consider it at sentencing.”

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 elements are directionally right. Dr. Chen has rightly cabined their probative value. The law’s task is to require convergence across history, mechanism, and moment, exclude common confounds, and confine the doctrine to reactive violence. With those guardrails—and bifurcation plus neutral experts—the gate stays tight enough to avoid floodgates while honoring Hart’s “fair opportunity” limit.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage exposure screen and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence as the candidate standard, what is the tightest administrable architecture you would write into a trial court’s gatekeeping order and jury charge to minimize error costs? Please (i) specify a pretrial 104(a)/Rule 702 protocol (notice, structured proffer, court‑appointed neutral experts, funding parity, and per se exclusions such as substantial voluntary intoxication and clearly instrumental/planned crimes), and (ii) draft a concise model instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause,” while clarifying what evidence jurors must disregard (e.g., mere poverty or generalized hardship without linkage). Where, if anywhere, do you still see fatal administrability or legitimacy risks?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen: none of these tools can time‑stamp volitional failure; the only defensible path is a convergent bundle tied to a reactive event signature and pre‑offense documentation. The law’s task is to keep the gate tight so we excuse only automatism‑like loss of control, and otherwise channel into MPC EED or sentencing mitigation.

On the metrics
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go; antisaccade; affective Stroop/Go–No‑Go): probative of inhibition when deficits are moderate-to-large and effort is valid; WCST is too nonspecific and should be down‑weighted. fMRI should not be part of admissible proof; hair/diurnal cortisol and historic BLLs are supportive, not dispositive.
- These measures are state‑sensitive; pre‑offense records do most of the causal work.

Minimum convergence I would require (clear and convincing)
Mandatory prongs:
1) Event‑level reactive signature with contemporaneous corroboration
- Seconds/minutes from salient provocation to act; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; 911/bodycam/video or neutral witnesses describing “blanking out,” autonomic arousal. If there was weapon retrieval from another location, concealment, or post‑event instrumental steps, the defense presumptively fails.

2) Pre‑offense documented dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile/ED notes of dissociation/IED; sleep disruption; prior rage episodes), showing the trait existed before the case.

Plus at least two of the following three, all with independent sources:
3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal, antisaccade, affective Stroop/Go–No‑Go), replicated or cross‑validated; multiple performance‑validity tests intact; low‑to‑moderate psychopathy profile to support impulsive rather than predatory aggression.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures; symptom ecology plausibly explains the trigger and dissociation; chronic stress marker (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or a prior ≥10), early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or well‑documented FASD risk; these must predate and plausibly relate to current executive deficits.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one defeats the excuse)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; malingering (failed PVTs or inconsistent profiles); strong evidence of planned/instrumental motive.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, incarceration stress can depress performance and cortisol; standardize testing and lean on pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation and “forensic artifacts”: prefer historic labs (BLLs), school/medical files, and hair cortisol for pre‑offense windows.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity indices and consistency across sessions.
- Misuse of PCL‑R: avoid over‑reliance; use only to differentiate impulsive from predatory patterns, mindful of bias concerns.
- Cultural essentialism: do not equate neighborhood with incapacity; individual‑level proof is required.

Procedural safeguards (administrability/error‑cost controls)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (geocoded residency; school, CPS, medical/lab, EPA/HUD, UI records).
- Limit the doctrine to genuinely reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcation with specialized instructions and special verdict interrogatories (e.g., findings on event reactivity, pre‑offense dyscontrol, test validity).
- Defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden; indigent funding parity is essential to avoid asymmetric access.

Disposition
- Where the showing rises to automatism‑like involuntary rage, a complete excuse may be warranted, followed by ESB‑oriented supervision and, if dangerousness persists with mental illness, civil commitment. Where the showing falls short, route to MPC‑style EED (homicide) or structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators.

Bottom line: the bundle Dr. Chen sketches can support a high‑confidence inference of substantial volitional impairment in a narrow band of cases. The law should demand the two mandatory prongs plus two of three corroborators, enforce the disqualifiers, and confine the defense to reactive violence. That preserves fairness (Hart’s “no punishment without fair opportunity”) without opening the floodgates or diluting the law’s expressive function for victims and communities.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle into courtroom practice? Specifically, propose (i) a short model jury instruction that defines “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause” for a reactive‑violence RSB excuse, and (ii) a Daubert‑style pretrial checklist the court should apply before letting the jury hear it (including how to handle intoxication, timing of testing, performance‑validity checks, and neutral experts). Keep it tight and administrable—what exact language and gate do you recommend?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Short answer. None of the proposed tools can, standing alone, time‑stamp a loss of control at the moment of offense. Used together, and anchored in pre‑offense documentation and event‑level corroboration, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of reactive dyscontrol in a narrow class of cases. The court’s job is to demand convergence across mechanism, history, and moment and to police the common scientific traps.

Are these measures specific and temporally sensitive enough? As components of a bundle, yes; individually, no.

- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop/Go–No‑Go) index inhibitory control and affect‑laden interference; they have moderate links to adversity/toxins but are state‑sensitive and vulnerable to poor effort. WCST is least specific and should be down‑weighted.
- Stress/exposure markers (childhood blood lead records; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; hair/diurnal cortisol) are probative of chronic load or developmental insult; none is specific to the index moment. Historic BLLs (especially repeated measures or ≥10 µg/dL once in childhood) are stronger than one‑off cortisol samples. fMRI should be treated, at most, as background science; its probative value in a single case is slight and its prejudicial effect substantial.

Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold

I would require all five pillars below, plus the absence of disqualifiers. This is a tight gate by design.

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment; disorganized execution; contemporaneous witnesses (or video/911/body‑cam) describing dissociation/“seeing red”/marked autonomic arousal; post‑event confusion or amnesia may support but is not sufficient.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- At least two independent sources predating the offense (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation or IED, prior ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption documented by schools/clinics). This addresses temporality and curbs reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neuropsychological profile with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with intact performance‑validity testing (multiple embedded and stand‑alone measures) and cross‑test convergence or re‑test stability; plus a low–moderate psychopathy/trait aggression profile consistent with impulsive (not predatory) aggression.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the trigger and phenomenology of the index event. Chronic stress physiology (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological/physiological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated, or a single ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition during key developmental windows; credible FASD risk; or validated chronic sleep disruption due to environmental factors), plus geocoded neighborhood/school deprivation records. Social deprivation alone is not enough.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one should presumptively defeat the excuse)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver (the ordinary rule should hold).
- Clear evidence of planning/instrumental motive or of post‑event concealment.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at the time of offense.
- Malingering/invalid test performance (failed PVTs, inconsistent profiles).
- Testing performed only long after the event without pre‑offense corroboration.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, pain, medication changes, and litigation stress depress executive performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer early testing; give weight to pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Require multiple validity indices; compel disclosure of raw data; be wary of “too bad to be true” or selective deficits.
- Acute intoxication: Distinguish developmental toxins (lead, FASD) from contemporaneous alcohol/drug effects. Voluntary intoxication should not bootstrap an excuse.
- Reverse causation and forensic artifacts: Post‑arrest stress can flatten cortisol and impair testing. Hair cortisol (3‑month window) and historic pediatric/educational records are better anchors than post‑charge snapshots.
- Test bias and norms: Ensure appropriate cultural/educational norming; use interpreters where needed; avoid over‑reliance on measures (e.g., PCL‑R) that carry known fairness concerns outside their validated contexts.
- Neuro‑flash: Exclude or tightly cabin fMRI/“brain pictures” under Evidence Rules 403/702 absent a solid, case‑specific rationale; their juror‑mesmerizing potential outweighs probative value in most single cases.
- Rater allegiance/expert shopping: Prefer court‑appointed neutral experts; scrutinize methods, not conclusions.

Administrability guardrails

- Notice and structured proffer tied to the five pillars; Daubert/Frye hearing; joint court‑appointed experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA, unemployment records; geocoded residence history).
- Special verdict form (e.g., findings on each pillar and on disqualifiers).
- Offense narrowing: limit to genuinely reactive violent offenses (and, rarely, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Jury instruction tracking Hart’s “fair opportunity to comply” limit: the defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Fallback channels

- Where the bundle is substantial but not complete, homicide should route to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance; otherwise, RSB evidence belongs at sentencing for structured mitigation and ESB‑oriented conditions.

Bottom line. The proposed batteries and markers are useful components of a convergent showing; none will do the job alone, and none can clock impairment to the second. A rigid, five‑pillar framework with neutral expertise, strict disqualifiers, and offense narrowing makes the doctrine morally defensible and institutionally governable.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage screen and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution as the substantive standard, can you design the gatekeeping architecture at trial? Specifically: propose (i) a Daubert‑style pretrial protocol and findings the court must make to let the defense go to the jury, and (ii) a concise model jury instruction with special interrogatories for a “reactive dyscontrol” excuse—using a clear‑and‑convincing standard, expressly excluding voluntary intoxication, and keyed to reactive (not planned) violence. Please be concrete about language so we can see if this is actually administrable.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 goes in the right direction, but courts should treat every instrument there as corroborative, not dispositive. None of the proposed tests or biomarkers time-stamp loss of control; they speak to trait vulnerability and mechanism. The evidentiary center of gravity must remain on the event signature and pre-offense documentation, with the science used to buttress plausibility and exclude rivals.

On the tools’ probative value
- Neurocognitive tasks
  - Stop-signal/Go–No-Go (with valid SSRT) are the most mechanism-proximate for inhibition; useful if deficits are reliable and effort-valid.
  - Affective variants (emotional Go–No-Go or affective Stroop) add relevance where aggression is affect-triggered; classic Stroop and WCST are broader executive measures and should be down-weighted.
  - Require multiple performance-validity tests; repeat or cross-validate results to reduce state noise.
- Stress/exposure markers
  - Hair/diurnal cortisol reflect chronic load, not momentary loss; supportive, not specific.
  - Historic childhood BLLs (especially repeated ≥5 µg/dL, or any ≥10) are probative of developmental insult to prefrontal control if paired with current inhibitory deficits.
  - Iron-deficiency/malnutrition/FASD documentation are supportive. fMRI should be rarely admitted, if at all, given Rule 403 concerns about undue prejudice and weak individual-level inference.

Minimum converging bundle (clear-and-convincing)
I would require all of the following, with failure on any core item defeating the excuse:

1) Event-level “reactive” signature
- Acute provocation with seconds–minutes latency; disorganized, non-instrumental execution; contemporaneous indicators of autonomic arousal/dissociation (“saw red,” blanking), ideally corroborated by video/911/bodycam. Any meaningful planning, luring, weapon staging, or concealment should presumptively defeat the claim.

2) Pre-offense, nonforensic history of dyscontrol
- School/juvenile/clinical records predating the offense documenting stimulus-bound outbursts, dissociation, or explosive reactivity; not created for litigation.

3) Neurocognitive evidence of impaired inhibition with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect-regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No-Go/Stroop), plus intact performance-validity indices; preferably stability across sessions or cross-test convergence. Include a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured-diagnostic finding by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom content and triggers plausibly explain the index event; low-to-moderate psychopathy/antisocial trait profile (avoid using PCL‑R deterministically).

5) Objective exposure biomarker or equivalent high-grade adversity
- At least one independently documented developmental insult (e.g., childhood BLL history, iron-deficiency/malnutrition, prenatal alcohol exposure). In the rare case lacking a biological marker, require a stronger showing on Items 2–4 (e.g., longitudinal dyscontrol records plus robust neurocognitive deficits and diagnosis).

And all of the following exclusions/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as the proximate driver defeat the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; cross-source consistency; beware “too-bad-to-be-true” patterns.
- Alternative explanations: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the event, and clear instrumental motive.
- Timing/artifacts: conduct testing promptly (ideally within 30–60 days) and anchor opinions in pre-offense records to avoid reverse causation from post-charge stress.

Scientific pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds: sleep loss, acute stress, meds can depress test performance and cortisol; standardize testing and, when feasible, repeat.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and alter cognition; rely on pre-charge documentation (school, medical, CPS, housing, EPA).
- “Neuroseduction”: colorful images and jargon can overpersuade; deliver limiting instructions that these are probabilistic, not time-locked.
- Base-rate/reference-class errors: average group effects do not prove an individual’s state at t0; insist on individualized linkage.
- Instrument misuse: WCST and PCL‑R are often overinterpreted; keep them in their lane (set shifting/risk—not guilt/innocence).
- Coaching and culture effects: ensure tests appropriate across language/education; avoid pathologizing deprivation itself.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and fairness)
- Pretrial Daubert-style hearing tied to a structured proffer; appoint neutral court experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Standardized documentation templates (labs, CPS, school, housing, UI, EPA/HUD; geocoded histories).
- Limit doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); bifurcate guilt/excuse and use specialized instructions making clear the fairness limit: no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will skew application and legitimacy.

Bottom line: the batteries and markers, standing alone, are not specific or temporally sensitive enough. In the narrow class where (1) a reactive event pattern, (2) pre-offense dyscontrol records, (3) valid inhibitory deficits, (4) a mapped diagnosis, and (5) an objective developmental insult align—and obvious alternatives are excluded—a clear-and-convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment is institutionally defensible. Outside that alignment, RSB belongs at sentencing mitigation, not at guilt.

---

### Speaker: Host

Please complete your point contrasting acute voluntary intoxication at the time of the offense with historical environmental toxin exposure (lead, FASD) in the attribution analysis. Then, in two or three bullets, specify the key “red flags” and exclusionary checkpoints courts should use to screen out weak dyscontrol claims (e.g., reverse causation from post‑charge stress/testing artifacts, inconsistency across sessions, instrumental offense features). Keep it crisp so judges can translate it into a checklist.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

Thanks, Chair. Let me complete the picture and be very explicit about what’s probative, what isn’t, and how courts should weigh it.

Specificity and temporal sensitivity
- No single neurocognitive test or biomarker can “time-stamp” loss of control at the moment of the offense. They are state- and trait-sensitive but not event-precise.
- As a bundle, they can support a clear-and-convincing inference if they align with event-level phenomenology and pre-offense documentation.

Clarifications on the proposed tools
- Neurocognitive batteries
  - Stronger tasks for inhibition/affect regulation: Stop-Signal (SSRT), Go/No-Go (commission errors), antisaccade, and an affective Go/No-Go or affective Stroop. WCST is least specific; I’d downweight it.
  - Include delay discounting or Cambridge Gambling (impulsive choice) as supportive.
  - Always include multiple performance-validity tests (embedded and stand-alone). Repeat testing or cross-task convergence reduces state noise.
- Stress/exposure markers
  - Hair cortisol (last 3 months) is more robust than single-day salivary profiles; both are nonspecific and must be interpreted cautiously (hair treatments, ethnicity effects).
  - Historic blood lead (BLL) during early childhood is probative of developmental insult, especially with repeated levels ≥5 µg/dL or a peak ≥10 µg/dL, and stronger still if paired with current inhibitory deficits.
  - Iron deficiency/malnutrition/fetal alcohol risk are supportive but not determinative.
  - Consider resting high‑frequency HRV (vagal tone) and threat-potentiated startle as supportive affect-regulation indices; not dispositive.

Minimum converging bundle to meet clear-and-convincing
Require all five pillars below, plus absence of disqualifiers. No single pillar suffices.

1) Event signature (must have)
- Rapid escalation (seconds–minutes) after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; lack of weapon staging or concealment; contemporaneous signs of autonomic arousal or dissociation (“saw red,” “blanked out”), ideally corroborated by video/911/bodycam/witnesses.

2) Pre-offense documentation (must have)
- Nonforensic, pre-charge records evidencing episodic, stimulus-bound dyscontrol (e.g., school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental health notes, ED visits for rage/dissociation, chronic sleep disruption). This establishes temporality and reduces reverse causation.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity (must have)
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect-regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and antisaccade; or SSRT and affective Go/No-Go), stable across sessions or with cross-test convergence, and with intact effort/validity indices.
- Trait profile consistent with reactive—not predatory—aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL-R; used cautiously).

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage (must have)
- Structured-clinical diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures, with symptom triggers that plausibly map onto the index event. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (flattened hair/salivary diurnal slope) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult (strongly preferred; justify if absent)
- Independent records of at least one exposure plausibly impairing prefrontal control (childhood BLL history; iron-deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive periods; prenatal alcohol exposure), and a dose–response story (worse exposure → worse inhibition).

Disqualifiers and alternative causes to exclude
- Voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (alcohol/stimulants) should presumptively defeat the excuse; the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the time of offense.
- Clear instrumental planning (luring, weapon staging, post‑event concealment).
- Malingering or exaggerated deficits (multiple failed PVTs, “too-bad-to-be-true” patterns).
- Reverse causation: if all abnormalities emerge only post‑charge, without pre-offense corroboration, weight them lightly.

Key scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, or acute legal stress can transiently depress executive performance and cortisol. Standardize testing (sleep, caffeine, meds); prefer repeated or corroborated assessments; use actigraphy or collateral sleep data where relevant.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; seek cross-source corroboration (teachers, employers, family).
- Acute intoxication: Distinguish historical toxins (lead) from acute substances; the latter commonly impair inhibition but usually do not excuse.
- Over-interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI/EEG findings, polygenic scores, and structural MRI differences have group-level associations with modest effect sizes and poor individual predictive value; reverse inference is a real risk. Admit only as supportive context, never as determinative evidence.
- Measurement invariance/bias: Some neurocognitive norms and instruments show cultural/educational bias; ensure demographically appropriate norms and report confidence intervals.
- Cherry-picking/post hoc testing: Require pre-specified test batteries and preregistered analytic plans in court orders to reduce selective reporting.

Procedural safeguards I’d endorse
- Early, structured Daubert-type hearing tied to the five pillars above; require a written proffer with documentary exhibits (medical/CPS/school/housing/EPA/juvenile records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Neutral, court‑appointed experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; provide defense with funding parity to avoid asymmetric access to proof.
- Timing: aim to complete initial testing within 30–60 days of charge; privilege pre-offense records and collateral reports; repeat testing if initial results are confounded by acute custodial stress.

Bottom line
These measures are not clocks; they are compasses. When they all point in the same direction—pre-offense dyscontrol, biologically plausible exposures, measurable inhibitory deficits with validity, and an event signature of reactive rage—courts can reasonably infer substantial volitional impairment at the time of offense under a clear‑and‑convincing standard. Keep the gate narrow by demanding this convergence and by excluding intoxication‑driven or instrumentally planned violence. For those who meet it, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions with supervision protect the public and respect Hart’s fairness limit without eroding the law’s expressive commitments.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your evidence/administrability hat: If you were to draft a model RSB–dyscontrol rule for courts, what precise elements would you write into (1) the substantive standard, (2) disqualifiers (e.g., voluntary intoxication, planning), and (3) procedural safeguards (notice, Daubert hearing with neutral experts, testing timelines, bifurcation, special verdict form)? Please be concrete about burdens of proof, offense‑domain limits, and jury instructions to minimize Type I/II errors and disparate application.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Short answer: Stage 2 can justify an inference of substantial volitional impairment only when multiple, independent strands line up. No single test (SSRT, Stroop, WCST) or biomarker (cortisol, historic BLL) is specific or time‑stamped enough by itself. The law should demand tight convergence around three axes: the moment (event signature), the person (pre‑offense functioning), and the mechanism (plausible developmental insults plus current inhibitory deficits). Otherwise, the evidence belongs at sentencing, not guilt.

On the proposed tools
- Neurocognitive tasks. Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with valid SSRT) and antisaccade are the most probative for motor inhibition; include an affective variant (emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop) because many incidents are affect‑triggered. Classical Stroop and WCST are less specific to inhibition; I would downweight WCST. Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) are essential, and results should be stable across sessions or supported by collateral records.
- Stress/exposure markers. Historic blood lead (during early childhood), iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, and well‑documented FASD risk are probative of developmental insult but not moment‑specific. Diurnal salivary cortisol is noisy; hair cortisol over a 3‑month window can support chronic stress but should be treated as supportive, not determinative. I would treat fMRI, EEG, and similar “flashy” modalities as presumptively inadmissible for individual attribution under Rule 702/Daubert given current specificity and error‑rate concerns; the probative value is substantially outweighed by Rule 403 risks of prejudice and confusion.

Minimum convergence I would require (clear and convincing)
Make two elements mandatory, and require at least four of five pillars overall:

Mandatory
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol:
- Near‑immediate response to a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous evidence (video/911/witnesses) of “blanking out,” extreme autonomic arousal, or dissociation. If planning/cover‑up is present, the excuse should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol:
- Nonforensic records predating the offense—school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile clinical notes, ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption—showing stimulus‑bound loss of control. This addresses temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation concerns.

Plus at least two of the following three
3) Neurocognitive profile with validity:
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), intact effort/validity indices, and cross‑task convergence or repeat stability. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) where feasible. Low–moderate psychopathic traits to support an impulsive (not predatory) profile; use with caution.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the incident:
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index event. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism:
- Independent records of early BLL ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or any ≥10), documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk, plus evidence linking exposure severity to current inhibitory deficits.

Universal disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering: require multiple performance‑validity tests, consistency across sessions, and collateral informants.
- Alternative explanations: exclude primary psychosis/mania (unless a different doctrine is invoked), acute TBI at the time, and clear instrumental motives.
- Testing conditions: standardize sleep/meds/caffeine; prefer early testing (30–60 days) corroborated by pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication changes depress performance and cortisol. Use repeat testing or rely on pre‑offense documentation to anchor trait.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: many defendants from deprived backgrounds will show group‑typical deficits; that does not establish proximate impairment at time T without the event signature.
- Adversarial allegiance and “neuroscience bleaching”: jurors tend to overweight brain‑talk and images. Use neutral, court‑appointed experts; avoid fMRI; give limiting instructions.
- PCL‑R misuse: treat as a coarse trait indicator only; avoid overreliance, especially outside capital contexts.
- Reverse causation/publication bias: post‑charge stress can flatten cortisol; hair segments and historical pediatric labs help; demand disclosure of all administered tests, not just favorable ones.

Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing tied to the structured elements above; standardized proffers and documentary templates (schools, CPS, medical labs, housing/EPA, UI records; geocoded residence history).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; blinded scoring where feasible.
- Clear notice and funding parity so indigent defendants can actually meet the standard.
- Narrow offense domain: reactive violence (and a very small class of truly impulsive nonviolent acts). Planned acquisitive crime presumptively excluded.
- Jury management: a limiting instruction that deficits matter only if they rendered the defendant substantially unable—not merely less likely—to inhibit a sudden, provoked act; special verdict on substantial impairment and causation.

Placement in doctrine
- When this bundle is met, I would treat it as an involuntary‑rage/automatism‑type excuse in tightly defined circumstances. Where the showing is weaker (e.g., strong history and mechanism but mixed event signature), channel the evidence to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance in homicide or to structured mitigation at sentencing keyed to verified deprivation indicators. That preserves public legitimacy while honoring Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment absent a fair opportunity to comply.

Bottom line
Santiago’s Stage 2 list is directionally right. To carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden at guilt, courts should insist on the mandatory event signature and pre‑offense documentation, plus convergent neurocognitive and exposure evidence, and strict exclusion of alternative causes. Anything less belongs at sentencing, not as an excuse.

---

### Speaker: Host

From the bench perspective: taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as a starting point, how would you draft (i) a pretrial gatekeeping order (Daubert/Rule 104) that specifies what is admissible and what are categorical disqualifiers, and (ii) a succinct jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and the clear‑and‑convincing burden—so we avoid a dueling‑experts morass? Please be concrete: list the minimum admissible categories (e.g., pre‑offense records, validated inhibition tasks with PVTs, objective exposure biomarkers), the barred items (e.g., standalone fMRI, post‑charge self‑reports), and give model language for the instruction that keeps jurors focused on reactive, not instrumental, violence.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally sound: courts should demand convergence across mechanism, history, and moment. But as a matter of evidentiary reliability and administrability, none of the proposed measures is specific or time‑precise on its own. The law’s question is narrow: did this defendant lack a fair opportunity to comply at the moment of offense? The science can support that inference only when the event looks reactive and the defendant’s pre‑existing deficits and exposures line up with that profile.

On the tools’ fit for purpose
- Neurocognitive tasks. Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the most probative for inhibitory control; Stroop adds some value; WCST is marginal for the mechanism at issue. All are state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation) and malingering‑susceptible without robust performance‑validity testing and, ideally, re‑testing.
- Stress/biologic markers. Childhood blood‑lead histories and other developmental insults (IDA/malnutrition, plausible FASD) strengthen causal plausibility but are not moment markers. Hair cortisol is more useful than single‑day salivary profiles for chronic load; still nonspecific. These are corroborators, not conclusions.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)
I would require all five of the following, with each component independently evidenced; no single element suffices:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Proximate provocation; seconds/minutes to offense; disorganized execution; lack of luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions of “blanking out,” marked autonomic arousal. Prefer objective corroboration (video/911/body‑cam, neutral eyewitnesses).

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the crime showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile/ED notes of dissociation/IED, sleep disruption records). This answers temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity safeguards
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and, where feasible, stability across sessions. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting). Trait profile should be inconsistent with predatory aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in the high range).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps onto the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented exposures and explaining triggers and phenomenology of the event. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation records of at least one biological insult (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), plausibly tied to current executive deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse (use at most as context at sentencing).
- Strong evidence of planning/instrumental motive defeats the excuse.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, or malingering (failed validity tests) defeats the excuse.

Scientific/legal pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds. Standardize testing conditions; prefer early testing plus re‑testing or cross‑task convergence; weight pre‑offense records heavily.
- Malingering/secondary gain. Use multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; beware “too bad to be true” or selective impairment profiles; consider court‑appointed neutral examiners.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact. Post‑charge incarceration stress and litigation can depress performance and cortisol; hair cortisol gives a pre‑offense window; contemporaneous community records are key.
- Acute intoxication. Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; keep intoxication separate from RSB dyscontrol; jurors need clear instructions on this.
- Over‑interpretation of neuro‑imaging. fMRI/EEG should be admitted, if at all, only as low‑weight corroboration after Daubert review; do not let the tail (pictures) wag the dog (event facts and pre‑offense history).
- Lab‑shopping/inequality. Use pretrial gatekeeping (Daubert) with court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; ensure indigent defense resources or the doctrine will skew.

Procedural and scope guardrails
- Pretrial proffer/hearing tied to a standardized checklist; defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden on both substantial impairment and causation.
- Limit domain to reactive violent offenses and truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcate proceedings and give specialized instructions: deprivation alone is not a defense; you must find substantial loss of inhibitory control at the time; voluntary intoxication does not qualify; if not excused, you may consider RSB at sentencing.

Bottom line
The proposed stage‑2 apparatus can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow band of cases if courts insist on the five‑part convergence above and police the pitfalls. For most other cases, the same evidence should channel to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance in homicide or structured mitigation at sentencing keyed to verified deprivation indicators. That preserves Hart’s fairness limit on punishment, keeps the gate tight enough to avoid floodgates, and protects public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Assuming we adopted Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle and disqualifiers for a narrow dyscontrol excuse, how would you operationalize this in court to keep it administrable and legitimate? Specifically: would you require a pretrial responsibility hearing (Daubert‑style) with court‑appointed neutrals, and what one‑paragraph jury instruction would you give on “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” limited to reactive, unplanned violence with a clear‑and‑convincing burden? Please draft the instruction language you’d endorse.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I’m largely in Dr. Chen’s camp: none of these instruments time‑stamps loss of control, and none should be dispositive. But as a convergent package—properly validated, pre‑offense‑anchored, and tied to a reactive event signature—they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment.

What I would accept, and how I’d cabin it

1) Event‑level signature (indispensable)
- Rapid, affective escalation after a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions of “blanking out/seeing red,” autonomic arousal; video/911/body‑cam if available.
- If there is planning, weapon staging, concealment, or instrumental motive, the inquiry should end.

2) Pre‑offense documentation (indispensable)
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, prior ED visits for rage, juvenile notes of dissociation), plus longitudinal exposure records (housing, CPS, school finance, neighborhood crime indices).
- This addresses temporality and guards against reverse‑causation artifacts from the litigation context.

3) Neurocognitive evidence (narrow and validity‑checked)
- Require convergence on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal with credible SSRT, Go/No‑Go/antisaccade, an affective variant such as emotional Go/No‑Go), each ≥1.5 SD below norms, with multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and standardized testing conditions (sleep/caffeine/meds controlled).
- Downweight or omit WCST; classic Stroop is supportive at best. Add a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available.
- Use trait measures (e.g., PCL‑R) cautiously to help distinguish reactive from predatory profiles.

4) Clinical linkage (diagnosis must map to the event)
- Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (PTSD—dissociative subtype or Intermittent Explosive Disorder) grounded in pre‑offense history; symptom triggers plausibly explain the index behavior.
- Stress physiology (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is admissible as corroboration, not as a linchpin.

5) Objective developmental insult (one or more)
- Childhood BLLs at or above recognized thresholds (≥5 µg/dL, stronger if ≥10, preferably repeated) during sensitive windows; or documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; or credible FASD risk—established in medical/public health records predating the offense.
- These make the mechanism plausible when paired with present inhibitory deficits.

Disqualifiers and exclusions
- Substantial voluntary intoxication proximate to the act should defeat the excuse absent persuasive proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Primary psychosis/mania (unless the defense is actually insanity), acute TBI at the scene, or strong instrumental motives.
- Malingering flags: failed PVTs, “too bad to be true” profiles, cross‑session inconsistency.

On the proposed biomarkers’ legal utility
- Neurocognitive tasks: admissible under Rule 702/Daubert if the lab uses standardized protocols, reports error rates, and applies appropriate norms (mindful of education/language/culture). Courts should prefer tasks with stronger inhibition validity (Stop‑Signal, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go) and require performance‑validity safeguards.
- Cortisol: treat as background corroboration of chronic stress; single‑day salivary profiles are too noisy. Hair cortisol (3‑month window) is better but methodologically finicky. Never sufficient alone.
- Historic BLLs: probative if measured in childhood and linked to current inhibitory deficits; not moment‑of‑offense indices. Specify the developmental window and threshold in a rule or standing order to avoid “toxins defense” creep.
- fMRI/advanced neuroimaging: generally exclude or admit only as pedagogic support with a strong Daubert foundation; high risk of jury over‑weighting.

Minimum bundle to meet clear and convincing
- All of (1) and (2), plus
- (3) neurocognitive deficits on two inhibition tasks with valid effort, plus
- (4) a mapped diagnosis, plus
- (5) one developmental insult documented pre‑offense,
- and none of the disqualifiers present.
That is a demanding, but administrable, gate.

Pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication changes. Standardize testing; where possible, repeat or corroborate with pre‑offense records.
- Base‑rate neglect and post hoc reasoning: don’t infer cause from common adversity; insist on the full convergence.
- Coaching/malingering: require multiple validity indices and collateral informants.
- Norms and equity: ensure appropriate normative comparisons (language, education, culture) and fund indigent testing, or we will create an access skew.
- Jury misperception: guard against “neuro‑narrative” overweighting; use limiting instructions.

Procedural guardrails (to keep administrability and legitimacy)
- Notice and a pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing keyed to a standardized checklist; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology/psychiatry/environmental health.
- Limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Require a special verdict on: (a) reactive dyscontrol occurred; (b) caused by documented RSB exposures; (c) substantially impaired capacity to conform law‑abiding conduct.

Dispositions
- If excused, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions under court supervision; civil commitment only where there is a qualifying mental disease and ongoing dangerousness. If the showing falls short, MPC‑style EED mitigation in homicide and structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators remain available.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 list is directionally right. Dr. Chen’s cautions are the scientific guardrails. The law’s job is to codify a narrow, convergent bundle, police the pitfalls through rigorous gatekeeping, and confine the doctrine to the small subset where Hart’s fairness limit is truly met.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume the court adopts Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage dyscontrol gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence with disqualifiers. From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, what procedural architecture would you require: (i) precise pretrial gatekeeping (Daubert/Kumho scope, use of neutral court‑appointed experts, documentary proffers), (ii) burden and standard (e.g., clear‑and‑convincing), and (iii) jury instructions and verdict form (special interrogatories?) to operationalize Hart’s ‘fair opportunity’ without inviting broad character evidence or cultural nullification? Also, where would you draw the line between what is admissible at guilt versus reserved for sentencing mitigation?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage structure and Dr. Chen’s cautions, with two judicial refinements: (a) keep the guilt‑stage excuse narrow and rule‑governed (reactive violence only), and (b) channel the remainder to sentencing mitigation with ESB conditions. Administrability and error costs demand bright lines.

1) Domain and burden
- Offense domain: limit the dyscontrol excuse to reactive, affective violent offenses (e.g., homicide/attempted homicide, first‑degree assault) with rapid onset after a salient trigger. Exclude planned acquisitive crime. Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse.
- Burden: clear and convincing evidence on each required element; defense gives timely notice; pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with written findings; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to avoid partisanship; resource parity for indigent defendants.

2) Stage 1 (eligibility): a hard, objective exposure screen
Require all of the following (with documentary proof):
- A. Longitudinal deprivation: residence ≥8 of first 18 years in tracts in top decile Area Deprivation Index (or ICE) plus school poverty (≥75% FRPL) or district in bottom quintile per‑pupil spending.
- B. Early adversity: ≥1 independent marker (substantiated CPS abuse/neglect; caregiver incarceration ≥12 months; documented witnessed homicide/serious violence; or ACEs ≥4 scored by a qualified clinician from pre‑offense sources).
- C. Biological insult: ≥1 verified developmental exposure (childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or any ≥10; or documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; or credible FASD risk from medical/child‑welfare records).

Note: if historical lab data do not exist, allow official proxies (e.g., HUD/EPA lead hazard orders tied to the residence period; municipal water exceedances) plus school/clinic records of developmental concerns.

3) Stage 2 (attribution): minimum converging bundle at guilt
Require all of the following five pillars; none alone suffices:

- 1) Event signature (reactive): near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment. Prefer objective corroboration (video/911/body‑cam; contemporaneous witness accounts of “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal). Any credible evidence of planning or instrumental motive presumptively defeats the excuse.

- 2) Pre‑offense dyscontrol history: nonforensic, pre‑charge records showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity; juvenile or clinical notes of dissociation/IED; ED visits for rage episodes; chronic sleep disruption tied to environment).

- 3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity: ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), plus intact performance‑validity testing and cross‑test or test–retest convergence. Add a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available. Downweight WCST; it’s nonspecific. Low–moderate PCL‑R (used cautiously) supports an impulsive—not predatory—profile.

- 4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the event: structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the index trigger/response. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive, not required.

- 5) Developmental exposure corroboration: at least one “hard” historic biomarker or equivalent (child BLLs/IDA/malnutrition/FASD proxy) predating the offense that plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls: substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate cause; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; malingering (failures on multiple PVTs); acute TBI at offense; strong evidence of calculated motive.

4) Evidence guardrails
- Admit fMRI/EEG, if at all, only as supportive context; never determinative. Diurnal salivary cortisol is noisy; hair cortisol (3‑month window) can support chronic load but is not specific. Courts should demand pre‑offense documentation to blunt reverse causation.
- Standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine); repeat key tasks or corroborate with pre‑offense records to manage state–trait confounds.

5) Jury management and instructions
- Bifurcation: guilt first; if the excuse proceeds, a focused second phase on dyscontrol. Use special interrogatories so jurors answer each pillar (reactive profile; pre‑offense history; neurocog deficits with validity; psychiatric linkage; developmental exposure) and disqualifiers (intoxication; planning).
- Pattern instruction (succinctly): “If you find, by clear and convincing evidence, that at the time of the offense the defendant’s capacity to inhibit action was substantially degraded due to documented environmental deprivations and developmental exposures, and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act, you must find the defendant not guilty by reason of dyscontrol. This is an excuse, not a justification; it does not declare the conduct right, only that the defendant could not fairly be blamed.”

6) Disposition upon excuse
- Prefer ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions under court supervision (housing relocation from criminogenic milieu; trauma‑focused therapy; nutrition/sleep stabilization; education/job pipelines; no‑contact/victim‑safety orders). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous and meet mental‑health criteria. Periodic judicial review.

7) Sentencing mitigation (the default channel)
- Where the excuse fails, the same verified exposures should support structured downward departures (e.g., 20–40% range) plus ESB conditions. Codify severe environmental deprivation with biological impact as a mitigating factor. This addresses fairness while protecting public legitimacy.

8) What I would not adopt
- RSB as justification for interpersonal violence—too high an expressive and institutional cost.
- “Societal fault” apportionment at guilt—percentaging blame in criminal trials invites politicization and unequal application; keep responsibility determinations binary at guilt, with mitigation handling gradations.

9) Implementation
- Pilot in violent dockets with appellate reporting; sunset/review after three years. Require written trial‑court findings on each pillar for meaningful review.

This structure keeps the gate tight—only cases at the top tail of cumulative adversity with clear reactive signatures and credible mechanistic linkage should reach the jury on excuse. Everyone else gets heard at sentencing, with ESB‑focused remedies that better protect victims and the public than cycling through prison.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming a dyscontrol excuse proceeds to a pretrial gatekeeping hearing, please outline a concrete, rule‑governed protocol a trial court should adopt: (i) the Daubert checklist you would require to admit Prof. Santiago/Dr. Chen’s Stage‑2 bundle; (ii) the precise elements the jury must find under a clear‑and‑convincing standard; and (iii) model instruction language distinguishing reactive dyscontrol from ordinary anger, voluntary intoxication, or planned aggression. Keep it tight and administrable—two or three bright‑line carve‑outs and no more than five elements for the jury.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 framework is directionally right if we want a dyscontrol excuse that is both principled and workable. The science won’t give us a time‑stamped “off switch,” so the law must insist on convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment. My concern is administrability and error costs. Here’s how I’d tighten it for courtroom use.

1) Offense-domain and burden
- Limit to reactive interpersonal violence (homicide, aggravated assault) with minimal planning; presumptively exclude instrumental/acquisitive crimes.
- Clear-and-convincing burden on the defense that (i) capacity to conform conduct was substantially impaired and (ii) that impairment was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

2) Gatekeeping procedure
- Pretrial Daubert hearing with a structured proffer; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Notice requirements and standardized documentary templates (medical labs incl. historic BLLs; school/IEP/discipline; CPS; housing/EPA/HUD; unemployment/benefits; geocoded residence history).

3) Minimum convergence required (no single item suffices)
A. Event signature (must have)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous observations of dissociation/“seeing red”/marked autonomic arousal (video/911/body‑cam where available).

B. Pre‑offense corroboration (must have)
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing episodic loss of control (IEPs/discipline for explosive behavior; prior ED/clinic notes of dissociation/Intermittent Explosive Disorder; documented chronic sleep disruption).

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity (must have)
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go SSRT; antisaccade; affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Low/moderate psychopathy scores or equivalent trait measures to support a reactive, not predatory, profile (used cautiously).

D. Psychiatric linkage (must have)
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom timing/triggers plausibly map onto the index event; anchored to documented exposures (not ex post fabrication).

E. Objective exposure biomarker (at least one)
- Childhood blood lead history ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated, or a single ≥10); or documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; or credible FASD risk; or verified chronic sleep adversity. These are not time‑specific but strengthen causal plausibility.

4) Disqualifiers/controls the court should be alert to
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause: generally defeats the excuse; defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress testing; prioritize pre‑offense records, standardize testing conditions, and, where feasible, repeat testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; look for cross‑source consistency (collateral interviews, records).
- Reverse causation/forensic artifacts: heavy reliance on pre‑charge records; hair cortisol (3‑month window) can help but is supportive only and confounded by hair care/ethnicity.
- Over‑interpretation of neuro “images”: fMRI/EEG should be treated as demonstrative or corroborative at best; do not let colorful pictures substitute for functional evidence of inhibition deficits.

5) Evidence I would downweight or exclude
- WCST as a centerpiece (set‑shifting, not inhibition); use only as a secondary measure.
- Single‑day salivary cortisol without replication.
- Post‑offense “first‑seen” diagnoses unsupported by longitudinal materials.

6) Jury management and instructions
- Bifurcation where feasible; specialized instruction framing the question as: Did defendant suffer a substantial impairment of capacity to conform conduct to law at the time, and was that impairment a substantial factor in causing the act?
- Special verdict interrogatories on (a) impairment and (b) causation to preserve transparency and reviewability.

7) Disposition
- If excused: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, job placement), with risk‑informed conditions and victim‑safety planning; reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous under applicable standards.
- Periodic judicial review; resource parity for indigent defendants so the doctrine does not become class‑skewed.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s batteries and markers can justify a clear‑and‑convincing inference only as part of a tightly specified bundle, cross‑validated by pre‑offense history and event‑level features, and screened through rigorous gatekeeping. That keeps us aligned with Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit while protecting administrability and public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assume we adopt a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the Santiago/Chen lines. From an administrability and error-cost perspective, what would your concrete pretrial protocol and pattern jury instruction look like? Please specify: (i) the elements the defense must prove and at what burden; (ii) disqualifiers (e.g., voluntary intoxication, evidence of planning); (iii) the structure of the Daubert-style hearing and use of neutral court-appointed experts; and (iv) whether you’d bifurcate and how to word limiting instructions to help jurors weigh converging neurocognitive/biological evidence without over-crediting it. Aim for a one-page, operational blueprint we could realistically implement in a busy urban felony docket.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I find Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage architecture sound in principle: an exposure screen that makes dyscontrol mechanistically plausible, followed by a tight, case‑specific attribution of substantially degraded inhibitory control at the moment of offense. Dr. Chen is right that none of the proposed instruments can time‑stamp volitional failure; the law’s task is to demand convergence strong enough to warrant the Hart/Fletcher “no fair opportunity” limit in a narrow band of reactive cases.

On the tools’ probative value
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go; antisaccade; affective interference tasks) are the best available proxies for inhibitory control, but are state‑sensitive and easily misunderstood. WCST adds little to the mechanism we care about. Multiple performance‑validity tests and, where feasible, replication or cross‑test convergence are essential.
- Stress markers (diurnal or hair cortisol) and historic BLLs are, at most, supportive. Hair cortisol gives a pre‑offense window but is noisy; BLLs speak to developmental insult, not instant causation. Treat fMRI/EEG as inadmissible for individual attribution absent extraordinary reliability showings; at most, they are background science.

What I would require under a clear‑and‑convincing standard
No single strand suffices. I would require all of the following, with the defense bearing the burden:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized conduct; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous corroboration (witnesses, video/911 audio) of dissociation/“seeing red”/marked autonomic arousal.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits), anchoring temporality and reducing reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Affective Stroop), intact effort indices (embedded PVTs and stand‑alone), and cross‑task convergence or stability across sessions. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits to support a reactive (not predatory) profile.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptom content plausibly tied to the trigger and course; biological stress markers are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult
- At least one independently documented biological exposure consistent with impaired prefrontal control (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency; credible FASD risk; or verified chronic sleep deprivation from environmental stressors).

And all disqualifiers addressed:
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute substance effects should presumptively defeat the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Alternative causes excluded: primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI, clear instrumental motives/planning, or malingering (multiple validity checks, collateral consistency).
- Offense domain: limit to affective/reactive violence (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.

Gatekeeping and procedure
- Notice and structured proffer tied to the elements above.
- Pretrial Daubert hearing focused on reliability/relevance and state–trait confounds; appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Standardized data templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD, UI records; geocoded exposure history).
- Testing timing and conditions standardized (sleep, meds, caffeine), with repeat or collateral corroboration where feasible.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; without it, the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

Jury instruction (sketch)
- “The defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the act, his/her capacity to inhibit an impulsive response was substantially degraded, and that this degradation was a substantial factor causing the act. Evidence of hardship alone is insufficient. You must consider whether the act was reactive and unplanned, whether independent records show prior dyscontrol, whether valid testing shows inhibition deficits, whether a diagnosed condition plausibly explains the event, whether there is an objective history of biological insult, and whether alternative explanations (including voluntary intoxication or planning) have been ruled out.”

Pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, medication, incarceration stress) depressing test performance; insist on standardization and pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain; require multiple validity indices and collateral verification.
- Reverse inference from biomarkers (e.g., cortisol) to momentary loss of control; treat as context only.
- “Culture” as a proxy: the issue is demonstrated impairment, not group membership.

Disposition
Where the excuse is found, I favor noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision (housing relocation, trauma‑focused therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pathways), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. That preserves public protection and legitimacy while avoiding the expressive endorsement that a justification would imply.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 criteria, refined as above and enforced through rigorous gatekeeping, can support a narrow dyscontrol excuse without opening floodgates. The convergence requirement, exclusion of instrumental crime and intoxication, and reliance on pre‑offense documentation are the institutional guardrails that keep this administrable and fair.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume the court recognizes a narrow RSB–dyscontrol excuse along the lines Prof. Santiago and Dr. Chen sketched. Please draft the core jury instruction you would give that: (a) states the legal standard—“substantial impairment of inhibitory control”—and the defendant’s clear‑and‑convincing burden; (b) confines the defense to reactive, unplanned conduct; (c) lists explicit exclusions (e.g., voluntary intoxication, malingering); and (d) requires convergence of evidence (event signature, pre‑offense history, neurocognitive deficits with validity, and at least one objective exposure biomarker). Keep the instruction under 200 words. Then, in two sentences, note the key pretrial Rule 702/403 gatekeeping criteria you would require before the instruction is given.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen: no single instrument can time‑stamp volitional failure, but a convergent bundle can justify a narrow dyscontrol excuse in a small slice of reactive violence cases. The court’s task is to turn that bundle into administrable gates that jurors can understand and that survive Daubert/Kumho scrutiny.

What the proposed tools can and cannot do
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, flanker; affective variants) are the most on‑point for inhibitory control. Stroop is supportive; WCST is too nonspecific to inhibition and I would downweight it.
- Stress and exposure markers (hair/diurnal cortisol; historic childhood BLLs; early malnutrition/IDA; FASD risk) speak to mechanism and temporality, not to the instant offense.
- None of these is specific enough alone; all are vulnerable to state–trait confounds and malingering. They belong in evidence only if tied to pre‑offense records and an event signature of reactive dyscontrol.

Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard
I would require all of the following (no one prong sufficient), and apply this only to affective/reactive violent offenses:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation within seconds/minutes of a salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of planning/weapon staging/cover‑up; contemporaneous descriptions of “going blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal; ideally corroborated by 911 audio/bodycam/video or neutral witnesses.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, pediatric/ED notes, juvenile mental‑health records) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control, sleep disruption, or dissociative episodes. This is the best antidote to reverse causation and litigation‑generated artifacts.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity safeguards
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below age‑adjusted norms (e.g., prolonged stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade error rate, affective Go–No‑Go), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and either test–retest stability or cross‑test convergence. Include an impulsive choice measure (e.g., delay discounting) if available. Downweight WCST; use Stroop only as supportive.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored in documented exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response pattern in the offense. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol profile over the pre‑offense window) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation proof of at least one biologically plausible insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; documented IDA/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), or verified residence in a unit subject to a lead‑hazard order during early childhood. This ties Stage 1 exposure to a mechanism that plausibly yields the Stage 2 deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Alternative causes: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time, and clear instrumental motives.
- Malingering: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; consistency across sessions; collateral informants. Be wary of selective, “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Trait profile: low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits (e.g., PCL‑R not in predatory range) to support a reactive (not instrumental) aggression phenotype.

Evidentiary and procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert/Kumho hearing with a structured proffer tying each item to an element above. Require standardized, preregistered testing protocols; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and a documentary spine: pre‑offense labs (BLLs, ferritin), school/CPS/medical/housing/EPA records, geocoded exposure history. fMRI/EEG should be treated as admissible only, if at all, for background science, not case‑specific diagnosis.
- Limit the offense domain: presumptively reactive violent crimes; exclude planned acquisitive crimes and cases with substantial instrumental planning.
- Burden of proof: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Bifurcation and instructions: try guilt first; if reached, instruct narrowly on dyscontrol as an excuse distinct from justification; use special interrogatories so appellate courts can see what the jury found on each prong.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medications can depress executive performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer pre‑offense records; consider actigraphy/sleep documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple PVTs; avoid over‑reliance on a single test; look for cross‑source convergence.
- Acute intoxication: do not let chronic “toxin” histories blur the line with voluntary substance use at the moment.
- Base‑rate neglect/ecological validity: lab tasks are proxies with modest effect sizes; the case must rise or fall on the totality, not a pretty scatterplot.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: BLLs and hair cortisol are historical/context markers; they do not prove momentary incapacity.

Disposition (to sustain public legitimacy)
Where the excuse is found, I would favor ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic blocks, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines) with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. Where the bundle falls short, MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (homicide) and structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators remain available.

Bottom line
Used this way, the Stage 2 tools can support—rarely but legitimately—a finding that Hart’s fairness limit has been crossed: no fair opportunity to comply in the moment. The convergence requirement, neutral expertise, narrow offense coverage, and clear‑and‑convincing burden are the institutional brakes that keep this from becoming an open‑ended diminished‑responsibility regime.

---

### Speaker: Host

From the trial judge’s chair, are Prof. Santiago’s gates and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle actually administrable without derailment? Please be concrete: (i) sketch a pretrial screening protocol (Daubert-style hearing structure, neutral expert appointment, and the defense’s clear-and-convincing burden); (ii) propose a short model jury instruction that defines “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and confines the excuse to reactive, unplanned violence; and (iii) state a bright-line rule on voluntary intoxication (disqualifier or not). Also, give us your error‑cost read: where are false positives/negatives most likely and how do your proposed controls minimize them?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Bottom line from a courts-and-evidence lens: none of the proposed measures time‑stamps volitional failure. They can, however, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial reactive dyscontrol if, and only if, they converge with strong event‑level proof and pre‑offense documentation. The court must cabin the inquiry, police reliability, and prevent neuro–forensics from overawing the jury.

1) Specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go; antisaccade; affective Stroop) are acceptable proxies for inhibitory control if administered with performance‑validity testing and appropriate norms, but they measure trait‑like capacities under test conditions; they cannot establish momentary loss of control.
- Stress/biologic markers (hair/diurnal cortisol; historic BLLs; documented early malnutrition/IDA) are mechanistically plausible but non‑specific and not temporally precise. They should be corroborative only.
- fMRI/EEG: high Rule 403 risk; rarely necessary. Admit, if at all, only as supportive and with a limiting instruction.

2) Minimum converging bundle to satisfy clear‑and‑convincing (defense burden)
I would require all of the following pillars, plus disqualifier screening, before the jury hears the excuse:

A. Event signature (contemporaneous evidence)
- Rapid, affective escalation after a salient trigger; no luring/staging/cover‑up.
- Disorganization and contemporaneous indicia of autonomic arousal/dissociation (body‑cam/911/witness accounts). Absent this, the motion should fail.

B. Pre‑offense documentary history of dyscontrol
- Non‑forensic, pre‑charge records (school IEP/discipline for explosive behavior; juvenile/ED notes; CPS; sleep disruption) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control. This is the best antidote to reverse‑causation and post‑hoc manufacture.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go), replicated or cross‑validated; intact performance‑validity indices; appropriate demographic norms.
- Low–moderate psychopathic traits to support a reactive (not predatory) profile.

D. Clinical linkage that maps to the offense
- Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures and plausibly explaining the index event’s triggers and phenomenology.
- Physiologic corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biologic insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or ≥10 once; early IDA/malnutrition; FASD risk) predating deficits.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one can defeat the excuse)
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver (alcohol/drugs) defeats the excuse (absent narrow involuntary exceptions).
- Planning/instrumental motive (luring, weapon preparation, concealment).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at offense.
- Malingering: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; inconsistency across sessions; “too bad to be true” task profiles.

3) Procedural gatekeeping (to keep the doctrine governable)
- Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing with a structured proffer tied to the pillars above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Standardized documentary proofs: geocoded address histories (ADI/ICE), school finance/discipline, CPS, medical labs (BLL, Hgb/ferritin), HUD/EPA orders, UI records.
- Timing: testing within ~60–90 days of the offense where feasible; heavy reliance on pre‑offense records.
- Limiting domain: reactive violent offenses (and only exceptionally truly impulsive nonviolent acts). Exclude planned acquisitive crime; channel those cases to sentencing mitigation.
- Special verdict interrogatories: require the jury to find (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time of offense, and (ii) that such degradation was a substantial contributing cause.

4) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, legal stress can depress performance and cortisol; consider actigraphy/sleep history; repeat testing; collateral records.
- Ecological fallacy/base rates: living in a deprived tract is not causation; insist on individual‑level documentation and nexus.
- Norming and cultural/linguistic bias: ensure tests use appropriate norms; document language proficiency and education.
- Publication/selection bias; expert “shopping”: use neutral experts; require disclosure of all testing attempts and results.
- Rule 403 risk: bar flashy imaging absent clear probative value; give limiting instructions that biomarkers are not determinative.

5) Disposition and public legitimacy
- If excused, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment services), with civil commitment available only upon the usual mental‑illness/dangerousness showing. Provide victim input and protective conditions.

This bundle aligns with Hart’s fairness limit (no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply) and addresses administrability: pre‑specified thresholds, neutral expertise, narrow offense domain, and rigorous exclusion of alternatives. It should make successful invocations rare, focused on the top tail of cumulative adversity where mechanism and moment genuinely align.

### Speaker: Host

Building on Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five-pillar convergence, please draft a concrete model jury instruction for a dyscontrol-based RSB excuse that is both morally accurate and administrably tight. Specify: (i) the elements the defense must prove (definition of “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and that it was a substantial contributing cause of the act), (ii) the burden/standard of proof, (iii) limiting language cabining the excuse to reactive, unplanned violence and expressly excluding voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver, and (iv) a short caution on how jurors should weigh expert testimony versus event-level evidence. Keep it precise—something a trial judge could actually read to a jury.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 rubric is the right ambition—tie mechanism, history, and the moment together—and Dr. Chen’s cautions are exactly the ones a court must internalize. The legal question, however, is what a trial judge can reliably gatekeep and a lay jury can fairly weigh without being overawed by science that is probabilistic and sometimes noisy. I would tighten Stage 2 to a small, rule‑governed bundle that is both evidentially demanding and administrable, and channel most hard cases to mitigation or MPC‑style EED rather than a full excuse.

1) What can support an inference of substantial volitional impairment “at T”?
No test or biomarker time‑stamps the instant of offense. The best the law can do is require converging strands that, together, make it highly probable the defendant’s inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation substantially caused the reactive act. I would require all of the following (clear and convincing, defense burden), with no single strand sufficient:

- Event signature (contemporaneous indicia)
  - Provocation-to-act interval in seconds or a few minutes; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; abrupt cessation; immediate confusion or distress; preferably corroborated by video/911/bodycam or multiple percipient witnesses.
  - Any evidence of planning, concealment, or instrumental payoff should presumptively defeat the excuse and push the case to mitigation/EED.

- Pre‑offense, nonforensic history of dyscontrol
  - Records predating the offense that document stimulus‑bound rage or dissociation (school discipline/IEPs, juvenile or ED notes, prior documented episodes). This answers temporality and reduces the “forensic artifact” problem.

- Neurocognitive evidence with validity safeguards
  - Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks anchored to the mechanism (e.g., stop‑signal/SSRT and antisaccade or affective Go‑No‑Go/affective Stroop), with intact performance validity (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs) and either replication across sessions or cross‑task convergence.
  - Downweight WCST; include delay discounting only as supportive. Treat PCL‑R cautiously; a low–moderate trait profile is supportive of impulsive, not predatory, aggression.

- Psychiatric linkage that maps to the episode
  - A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD with dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptom content and triggers plausibly explaining the index event and anchored to Stage 1 exposures (not built solely from self‑report after arrest).

- Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
  - At least one independently documented biological insult during sensitive periods—historic lead levels (preferably repeated ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10), verified iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk—or a comparably documented sleep/circadian disorder tied to chronic environmental stress. This is not time‑specific, but in combination with the above, it strengthens causal plausibility.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls:

- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; otherwise route to mitigation, not excuse.
- Exclude primary psychosis/mania unless a distinct doctrine is invoked; traumatic brain injury at T defeats the specific attribution unless independently proven.
- Multiple validity checks to detect exaggeration; look for consistency across data sources and sessions.
- Guard against reverse causation: prefer pre‑charge records; if using cortisol, favor hair segments reflecting the pre‑offense window; treat single‑day salivary profiles as weakly probative.

2) Scientific pitfalls the court should be most alert to

- State–trait confounding: acute sleep loss, meds, or legal stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; where feasible, retest or corroborate with pre‑offense documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: use multiple PVTs; beware selective, “too bad to be true” impairment or profiles that improve when incentives change.
- Neuroscience “seductive allure”: fMRI/EEG should rarely be admitted; if admitted, only as marginally supportive of an already‑established clinical/neurocognitive picture, never as stand‑alone proof of causation.
- ACEs inflation: treat checklist scores as screening, not proof; prefer documentary corroboration (CPS, school, medical).
- Racial/ethnic test bias and PCL‑R misuse: ensure appropriate norms; caution the jury against reading trait measures as destiny.

3) Narrowing the offense domain
As a matter of administrability and fairness to victims, I would confine a dyscontrol excuse to reactive interpersonal violence (and a small class of truly impulsive nonviolent offenses). Planned acquisitive crimes, felony‑murder predicates, and offenses with clear instrumental preparation should be categorically excluded from excuse and relegated to mitigation/EED.

4) Procedure and gatekeeping

- Notice; structured proffer; Daubert‑style pretrial hearing focused on the five‑strand bundle above.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); equal funding for indigent defendants—without that, the doctrine will skew toward the resourced.
- Bifurcation to preserve jury focus: guilt first; if the jury finds the elements, proceed to dyscontrol phase with specialized instructions; reserve a separate sentencing/ESB phase if mitigation only.

5) Model jury instruction (sketch)
“To establish the dyscontrol excuse, the defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the offense, his/her ability to inhibit an immediate impulsive act was substantially impaired, and that this impairment was a substantial cause of the act. Evidence of a difficult background alone is not enough. You may consider: (a) whether the act followed a sudden provocation without planning; (b) whether, before this offense, the defendant had documented episodes of stimulus‑bound loss of control; (c) whether objective tests showed reliable deficits in inhibition; (d) whether a diagnosed trauma or impulse‑control condition plausibly explains the episode; and (e) whether independently documented developmental insults make such impairment plausible. If voluntary intoxication was the primary cause, the excuse does not apply.”

6) Disposition
Where the excuse is found, I would follow an automatism‑style path: a special verdict, followed by a dangerousness hearing. If not dangerous, conditional release with ESB conditions (housing relocation, trauma‑focused treatment, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports) under court supervision. If dangerousness is proven and mental disease criteria are met, civil commitment; if not, intensive ESB supervision with frequent judicial review. Where the showing falls short of excuse but meets EED/mitigation, adjust the conviction/sentence accordingly.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s framework, trimmed as above, and Dr. Chen’s cautions can be translated into a workable gate: tight offense class, a five‑strand evidentiary bundle, explicit disqualifiers, neutral expertise, and bifurcated proceedings. That keeps faith with Hart’s “fair opportunity” limit, preserves public legitimacy, and avoids turning hard social facts into an unbounded acquittal machine. Where the strands do not converge, RSB belongs in structured mitigation and, in homicide, in MPC‑style EED—not at guilt.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate the Santiago–Chen framework into courtroom practice by drafting a concise model jury instruction and accompanying special‑verdict interrogatories for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse? Please reflect: (i) the clear‑and‑convincing burden; (ii) elements—substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense and substantial contribution by documented RSB exposures; (iii) offense must be reactive/affective rather than planned; and (iv) disqualifiers like voluntary intoxication. Also indicate, in a sentence or two, what evidentiary guidance the instruction should give (e.g., how to weigh neurocognitive tests and deprivation histories, and that such deficits are insufficient absent event‑level signs of reactive dyscontrol).

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

From a trial-management and evidence perspective, Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 framework is directionally right but needs sharpening to keep the gate narrow and the record reliable. None of the proposed tools can time‑stamp volitional failure; they support inference only when they converge with the event’s “reactive” signature and pre‑offense documentation. Courts should demand convergence, independence, and temporality, and avoid overreliance on any single biomarker or test.

Are the measures specific/temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the most mechanism‑proximate; Stroop is supportive; WCST adds little to inhibition and can be dropped or down‑weighted. All are trait‑leaning and state‑susceptible; they corroborate a control deficit but do not by themselves show loss of control at T0.
- Stress/toxin markers: Childhood BLLs (preferably repeated or ≥10 µg/dL once) and documented early iron deficiency/malnutrition are probative of developmental insult; hair cortisol (3‑month window) is more useful than single‑day saliva for chronic load. None is specific to the instant act.
- Bottom line: Use these as corroborators. The decisive evidence remains event phenomenology and pre‑offense records showing the same kind of dyscontrol before litigation.

Minimum bundle for clear and convincing (all required unless noted)
1) Event signature (proximate reactivity)
- Immediate escalation after salient provocation; no luring or preparation; disorganized execution; contemporaneous observations (video/911/bodycam/witness) of “going blank/seeing red,” autonomic arousal; minimal concealment.
- Presumptive failure if there is planning, instrumental motive, or post‑event management.

2) Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (e.g., school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits). This mitigates reverse causation/forensic artifact.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and consistency across sessions. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available. Down‑weight WCST; avoid overinterpretation of global composites.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the event
- Structured‑instrument PTSD (dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder diagnosed by a qualified clinician, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response in the index offense. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol flattening, low HF‑HRV) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult (at least one)
- Historic BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or a documented ≥10); or documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; or credible FASD risk. Independent records (pediatric labs, WIC/clinic, housing/EPA orders) required.

And all of the following exclusions/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse (RSB history cannot launder acute self‑induced impairment).
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, and malingering (multiple PVTs; collateral consistency).
- Testing within ~60–90 days with standardized conditions; triangulate with pre‑offense records to address state–trait confounds.

Scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: sleep loss, medication changes, acute litigation stress can depress performance and cortisol; require standardized testing and, when possible, repeat or corroborate.
- Malingering/secondary gain: insist on multiple validity indices; beware selective deficits and “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Acute intoxication: separate developmental toxin history (lead, FASD) from alcohol/stimulant effects at T0; the latter should generally bar the excuse.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and affect testing; weigh pre‑offense documentation heavily.
- Neurohype: avoid fMRI/EEG as determinative; admit only as supportive under Daubert/Kumho with limiting instructions.
- Tool bias: be cautious with PCL‑R; use primarily to exclude high‑predatory profiles, not to define culpability.

Procedural safeguards (administrability/equality)
- Early, detailed notice; prima facie written proffer keyed to the elements above before a Daubert/Kumho hearing.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and a very small subset of truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions to preserve jury focus.

Model instruction (gist)
“The defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the act, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate, provoked response was substantially impaired such that he lacked a fair opportunity to conform his conduct to law. Transient anger, ordinary stress, poor judgment, or voluntary intoxication do not suffice.”

Disposition
If established, order noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep support, employment), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

Why this won’t open the floodgates
Requiring (i) a reactive event signature, (ii) pre‑offense dyscontrol records, (iii) performance‑validated inhibitory deficits, (iv) a diagnosis that maps to the event, and (v) at least one objective developmental insult—plus intoxication exclusion—will confine relief to a narrow slice of cases where mechanism, history, and moment align. The rest of RSB evidence should be channeled to MPC‑style EED in homicide and to structured sentencing mitigation.

---

### Speaker: Host

You were distinguishing acute intoxication from developmental toxin history when the transcript cut off. Please complete that point: how should courts weigh voluntary intoxication vis‑à‑vis chronic exposures (lead, FASD) that degrade control? Also, based on your five‑pillar convergence, what are your best estimates of false‑positive versus false‑negative risks if courts adopt this gate (e.g., among violent felony defendants), and how might we further reduce error (standardized testing windows, replication, neutral panels) without making the doctrine unusable?

---

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

Continuing

- Over-interpretation of neurobiomarkers
  - fMRI/EEG: group-level associations cannot be back‑translated into single‑case “loss of control” determinations. Susceptible to analytic flexibility, motion, and publication bias; visually compelling to jurors. Admit, if at all, only as supportive context with preregistered pipelines, raw data disclosure, and consensus reporting; never as determinative.
  - Hair/salivary cortisol: treat as chronic load indicators with wide confidence bands; avoid reading day-of-offense states from them.

- Measurement error, norms, and cultural bias
  - Use demographically corrected norms (age, education, language, culture). Many inhibition tasks have only moderate test–retest reliability; prefer convergence across tasks and sessions.
  - Be wary of WCST overuse; it is not a specific index of inhibition. Favor directly targeted tasks (stop‑signal, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go).
  - Require disclosure of normative references, reliability coefficients, and validity indices; avoid cherry‑picked subtests.

- Ecological validity and base rates
  - Lab tasks capture narrow constructs; real‑world aggression is context‑rich. Anchor in event‑level evidence (video, eyewitness, 911 audio).
  - High ACEs or prior elevated BLLs are common in many communities; most exposed individuals do not offend. This is why a convergence standard (history + mechanism + moment) is essential.

- Multiple comparisons and p‑hacking
  - Forensic reports that test many domains increase false‑positive risk. Courts should insist on a priori hypotheses tied to the dyscontrol mechanism and on full reporting (including null findings).

- Confounds the court should scrutinize closely
  - Acute intoxication timeline (toxicology + receipts + phone/location data) relative to the offense.
  - Sleep deprivation and medication effects proximate to testing (document sleep with actigraphy or collateral; standardize caffeine/medication).
  - Post‑charge stress artifacts (repeat testing; use pre‑offense records).
  - Malingering (multiple PVTs; symptom validity tests; cross‑informant convergence).
  - Alternative psychiatric drivers (first‑episode psychosis, mania, TBI) that call for different doctrines or defeat RSB dyscontrol.

Minimum bundle (clear and convincing)

I would require all of the following, with no single element sufficient:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation after salient provocation; minimal planning; disorganized execution; contemporaneous signs of autonomic arousal/dissociation; corroboration by video/911/bodycam or neutral witnesses.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of similar dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental health notes, ED visits, probation reports) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two validated inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal, antisaccade error rate/latency, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact effort measures and either test–retest stability or cross‑task convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive, not predatory, aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R; alternative trait measures), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage mapping to the index offense
- Clinician‑established PTSD (dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder (or comparable) using structured instruments, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures; symptom triggers plausibly match the offense. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) are supportive.

5) Objective developmental exposure biomarker
- Independent documentation of at least one biological insult temporally situated in development (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, or ≥10 once; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; documented FASD risk), plausibly connected to current executive deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls satisfied
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate cause (if present, defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; generally, voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse).
- Multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity indicators passed; consistency across sessions and informants.
- Rule‑out of primary psychosis/mania/TBI as the main driver; exclusion of instrumental motives (luring, weapon staging, concealment).

Procedural recommendations
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearings with court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Standardized documentary proffers (medical labs, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD, unemployment records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Early testing (within 30–60 days) with repeat or corroborative assessment; heavy reliance on pre‑offense records to mitigate forensic artifact.
- Clear jury instruction: the impairment must be substantial (not mere difficulty), not self‑induced, and a substantial contributing cause of the act; this excuse applies to reactive, not planned, violence.

Bottom line
The proposed batteries and markers are not time‑stamps of momentary control loss. Used together—tied to a well‑documented developmental exposure profile and a reactive event signature—they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a narrow class of cases. Courts should guard most against state–trait confounds, intoxication, malingering, and over‑claiming from sexy biomarkers. When the gate is met, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions with supervision and, where necessary, civil commitment for demonstrable ongoing dangerousness best align with public safety and fairness.

---

### Speaker: Host

Put on your trial-judge hat: assuming we recognize a narrow RSB dyscontrol excuse along the lines sketched by Prof. Santiago and Dr. Chen, what would your core jury instruction look like? Please draft the elements the jury must find (e.g., substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the act and causal contribution), explain in the instruction how this excuse differs from insanity and from MPC extreme emotional disturbance, and state the burden of proof you would assign (e.g., clear and convincing on the defendant). Would you confine the instruction to reactive violent offenses? Be concrete—model language that a trial judge could actually read.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I find Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 attribution framework directionally right, and Dr. Chen’s cautions are on point. To make this administrable and legitimate, I would adopt a narrow, rule‑governed gate keyed to reactive violence (not instrumental offending), require clear and convincing proof, and insist on convergence across a small set of specified indicia. Courts should avoid turning trials into open‑ended neuroscience seminars.

What I would require, in addition to a Stage 1 exposure showing, to meet clear and convincing on Stage 2

Offense domain and trigger
- Eligible offenses: affective/reactive violent acts (e.g., sudden assaults/homicides) with close temporal proximity to a salient provocation; presumptive ineligibility for planned acquisitive crimes and predatory violence.
- Event signature: contemporaneous evidence of “reactive dyscontrol”—rapid escalation, disorganization, no luring or staging, no concealment; corroboration via witnesses, video/911, or bodycam where available.

Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control or affective dysregulation (school IEP/discipline, juvenile mental‑health notes, prior ER visits for explosive episodes, sleep disruption tied to environment). This guards against reverse causation and forensic artifacts.

Neurocognitive profile with validity checks
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Stroop or affective Go‑No‑Go). WCST is low‑specificity; it should not carry weight.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone), with retest or cross‑task convergence if initial results are borderline.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (low–moderate PCL‑R or equivalent; use cautiously).

Psychiatric linkage that maps to the event
- A structured, clinician‑established diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tethered to Stage 1 exposures and plausibly explaining the index trigger/response; collateral corroboration preferred.

Objective exposure biomarker supporting mechanism (not timing)
- At least one historic biological insult documented independent of litigation: childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (repeated or one ≥10), or documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk. These do not time‑stamp impairment but make the mechanism plausible, especially when aligned with current executive deficits.
- Stress physiology (hair cortisol blunting; low resting HF‑HRV) may be admitted as supportive only; single‑day salivary cortisol is too noisy to carry weight.

Disqualifiers and exclusions
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse. Evidence must show baseline dyscontrol independent of alcohol/drugs.
- Primary psychosis/mania (unless a distinct doctrine applies), acute TBI at the scene, or strong instrumental motive negate the theory.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral reports. Courts should be alert to “too bad to be true” patterns.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and fairness)
- Notice and proffer: Require detailed pretrial notice and a Daubert‑style hearing keyed to the elements above. No “culture shopping”: appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; allow party experts but anchor the record in neutral assessments.
- Funding parity: Ensure indigent defendants can access testing and records; otherwise the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.
- Limit expert scope: Experts may explain methods/findings and how they relate to inhibitory control; they should not opine on the legal ultimate issue (whether the legal standard of “substantial impairment” is met).
- Bifurcation and instructions: Try guilt first; if actus/mens established, proceed to an RSB‑dyscontrol phase (akin to insanity practice). Use a pattern instruction tied to Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply—and require special verdict findings on each pillar (reactive trigger/no planning; pre‑offense dyscontrol; test deficits with validity; psychiatric linkage; biomarker; exclusion of intoxication/alternatives).
- Evidence hygiene: Standardize test conditions (sleep, meds), require disclosure of raw data, and prefer pre‑offense records over post‑charge assessments when in tension.

Disposition (if excuse found)
- Noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep supports, job pipelines), with victim‑safety measures (no‑contact orders, GPS if indicated). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain dangerous and meet statutory criteria.

Why this stays narrow
- Requiring: (1) a reactive event signature, (2) pre‑offense corroboration, (3) valid neurocognitive deficits on inhibition tasks, (4) a diagnosis that maps to the incident, and (5) at least one documented developmental biological insult—while excluding intoxication and planning—will confine relief to the exceptional case where mechanism, history, and moment align. Most dockets will see few such cases.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police (echoing Dr. Chen)
- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, incarceration stress) and reverse causation—mitigated by pre‑charge records and, where used, hair cortisol rather than single salivary draws.
- Over‑reading neuroimaging—admit, if at all, as pedagogy with a limiting instruction; it is not diagnostic of momentary control.
- Performance validity and replication—no single test; look for cross‑method convergence and stable findings.

This keeps faith with moral limits on blame (fair opportunity to comply), preserves public legitimacy, and avoids the floodgates. I would pair this with MPC‑style EED in homicide as a mitigation route when full excuse is not warranted, and with structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators for the broader run of cases.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming we adopt a narrowly circumscribed dyscontrol excuse along the lines Prof. Santiago outlined and Dr. Chen vetted, what would your model legal architecture look like to keep it administrable? Please sketch (briefly but concretely) (i) a pretrial gatekeeping protocol—burden and standard, notice, required proffer, and whether to appoint neutral experts—and (ii) a concise jury instruction that enumerates the specific findings the jury must make to excuse (e.g., reactive event profile, documented developmental exposures, validated inhibition deficits, exclusion of intoxication/instrumental motives), plus any limiting principles (offense types, special verdict form). Aim for language tight enough for trial judges to use tomorrow, and explain the key error-cost tradeoffs you’re trying to manage.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you, Chair. I largely concur with Prof. Santiago’s structure and Dr. Chen’s cautions. As a matter of adjudication, no single test or biomarker can time‑stamp loss of control. The only workable path is convergent proof tied to Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply—applied with tight gates to avoid error costs and preserve legitimacy.

Are the proposed measures specific/temporally sensitive?
- Standing alone, no. Stop‑signal, Stroop, WCST, cortisol, historic BLLs are state‑ and trait‑sensitive but not moment‑specific. They can, however, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference when they align with event‑level phenomenology and pre‑offense documentation, and when better explanations are excluded.

Minimum bundle I would require (all five; defense bears clear and convincing burden):
1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Provocation-to-assault interval measured in seconds/minutes; disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment; contemporaneous reports of “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal; video/911/bodycam if available. Any substantial planning or instrumental motive defeats the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense history of stimulus‑bound loss of control
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline; juvenile mental‑health notes; ED visits; CPS) showing episodic explosive reactivity, dissociation, or chronic sleep disruption.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time; Go/No‑Go or antisaccade; an affective variant such as emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indices and cross‑task convergence or replication.
- Low–moderate psychopathic traits (e.g., PCL‑R below moderate range), consistent with impulsive rather than predatory aggression.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage mapping to the index event
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to exposures documented pre‑offense and plausibly explaining triggers and phenomenology of the offense.
- Chronic stress corroborant (optional, supportive): hair cortisol flattening or low resting HF‑HRV, interpreted cautiously.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent documentation of at least one: childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or a ≥10 reading) during sensitive periods or residence in a unit under a lead hazard order; diagnosed iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk; or similar environmental toxin exposure. The point is plausibility and dose‑response, not momentary causation.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances present, defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Alternative causes ruled out: primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at offense; malingering (multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests, consistency across sessions).
- Reverse‑causation guardrails: rely on pre‑charge records; standardize testing (sleep/meds/caffeine); consider retesting.
- No over‑weighting neuroimaging. fMRI/EEG may be admissible as supportive under Daubert/Kumho but never determinative.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, meds, litigation stress) depressing task performance and cortisol; address via standardized conditions and replication.
- Malingering/secondary gain; require robust validity testing and collateral corroboration.
- Acute intoxication conflated with dyscontrol.
- Base‑rate neglect: many disadvantaged defendants will have some deficits; do not infer causation absent event‑level fit and temporality.
- WCST’s low specificity to inhibition; downweight or omit in favor of stop‑signal/antisaccade/affective tasks.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and equality)
- Pretrial Daubert/Kumho hearing keyed to a structured proffer (the five pillars above).
- Neutral, court‑appointed experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS/school, housing/EPA/HUD, UI records; geocoded exposure history).
- Offense domain: presumptively limited to reactive violent offenses (and rare truly impulsive nonviolent acts); exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden: clear and convincing proof that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Trial management
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions. If the court finds the threshold met, the jury should receive a focused instruction: poverty or anger alone is never enough; the question is whether, due to cumulative, documented exposures, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an impulsive, affect‑driven response was substantially impaired at the moment of the offense. Emphasize immediacy and lack of planning.

Disposition
- If excused, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep supports, job pipelines), with civil commitment available where the person remains demonstrably dangerous. Incorporate victims’ voice and safety planning.

Why this won’t open the floodgates
- Requiring alignment across event signature, pre‑offense records, neurocognitive deficits with validity, a developmental insult, and a diagnosis that maps to the event makes this a rare defense. It honors Hart’s “fair opportunity” limit while respecting Fletcher’s concern for administrability and public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume we adopt a dyscontrol excuse roughly along the Santiago/Chen gate: a Stage 1 cumulative exposure profile plus Stage 2 event-level attribution with the five pillars and disqualifiers. What concrete procedural architecture would you implement to keep this administrable and legitimate—e.g., pretrial Daubert-style hearing, neutral court experts, bifurcation, special verdicts—and what tight model jury instruction would you give? Please specify: (1) who bears what burden and the standard; (2) limiting principles (reactive violence only, intoxication bar, planning disqualifier); (3) the precise causal question for the jury; and (4) whether you’d require unanimity on each pillar or a global finding, and how you’d structure the verdict form to make appellate review meaningful without turning trials into mini-epidemiology seminars.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions. Stage 2 is where the floodgates risk lives or dies. No single measure can time‑stamp loss of control; we therefore need convergence, strong temporality, and disciplined exclusions. Here is what I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard, with administrable guardrails a trial judge can apply at a Daubert‑style hearing.

A. Offense domain and exclusions up front
- Domain: reactive interpersonal violence with short latency (seconds to a few minutes) after a salient provocation.
- Presumptive exclusions: planned or instrumental crimes (luring, weapon staging, lookout teams, concealment efforts), felony murder tied to planned felonies, substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver, primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures, strong malingering indicators.

B. Minimum bundle for Stage 2 attribution (all five required)
1) Event‑level signature of dyscontrol
- Acute trigger; minimal planning; disorganized execution; contemporaneous witnesses (or audio/video) indicating dissociation (“saw red,” blanking), marked autonomic arousal; brief episode length; post‑event confusion or amnesia (supportive but not sufficient).
- Negative indicia: steps to avoid detection, extended pursuit, theft/retaliatory motive untethered to the trigger.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- Records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound outbursts or impulse‑control failures: school IEP/discipline notes, juvenile clinic notes (dissociation/IED), ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption corroborated by school/medical records. This addresses temporality and reverse causation.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity and mechanism fit
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time; Go/No‑Go or antisaccade; include an affective variant such as emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop).
- Delay discounting or similar impulsive choice measure (supportive).
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) passed; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Low to moderate psychopathic traits (e.g., PCL‑R not in the high range); use cautiously and never as a gatekeeper.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) with symptom content plausibly explaining the index episode and anchored to Stage‑1 exposures.
- Stress physiology is supportive, not dispositive: hair cortisol flattening over a pre‑offense 3‑month window is better than single‑day saliva; interpret with awareness of hair treatment/ethnic confounds.

5) Objective developmental exposure/biological insult
- At least one contemporaneously documented insult plausibly affecting prefrontal control systems:
  - Childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated, or a prior ≥10 µg/dL), or
  - Clinically documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition during sensitive periods, or
  - Diagnosed FASD risk with corroborating pediatric/child‑welfare records.
- These are supportive of mechanism; they do not replace (3) and (4).

C. Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls (all must be addressed)
- Voluntary intoxication: where acute alcohol/drug effects are the proximate driver, the excuse fails. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing conditions (sleep, caffeine, meds), repeat or corroborate where feasible, and lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering: require multiple PVTs; be wary of selective or “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI: if present and not traceable to RSB exposures, this is the wrong doctrine.

D. Evidentiary and procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial structured proffer tying each item to the five required pillars; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health to reduce partisanship.
- Daubert screening: known error rates, peer review, standards. Admit fMRI/advanced neuroimaging only, if at all, as modestly supportive; it is not case‑level proof of momentary dyscontrol.
- Testing window: as early as practicable (ideally within 30–60 days), with performance‑validity checks; supplement with pre‑offense documentation to blunt post‑charge artifacts.
- Standardized record set for Stage 1/2: pediatric labs (BLLs, ferritin), CPS/school/IEP files, housing/EPA lead orders, unemployment/eviction records, geocoded exposure histories.
- Special verdict interrogatories: require the jury to answer whether (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of offense and (ii) the degradation was a substantial contributing cause, and (iii) none of the disqualifiers applied. This preserves transparency and appellate review.
- Funding parity: indigent defendants must have resources to meet the standard; otherwise the doctrine is illusory and unequal.

E. Scientific pitfalls courts should watch most closely
- State–trait and timing: executive and cortisol measures are noisy and condition‑sensitive; demand replication or corroboration and pre‑offense records.
- Malingering and coaching: insist on validity testing and cross‑source consistency.
- Intoxication confounds: common and powerful; do not let toxin‑history (lead, FASD) be used to launder an alcohol‑driven episode.
- Over‑claiming from biomarkers (“brain overclaim syndrome”): BLLs and cortisol increase plausibility but do not fix the moment of offense.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress and litigation can depress performance/flatten cortisol; hair cortisol helps with pre‑offense windows but is not immune to confounds.

Bottom line
- Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 elements are directionally right; Dr. Chen is right that they are supportive only in convergence. If we hold the defense to the “five pillars” above, within a narrow offense domain and with firm disqualifiers, we will vindicate Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without fair opportunity—without sacrificing administrability or public legitimacy.
- Disposition: where the excuse is found, channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (housing relocation, trauma‑focused therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines), with civil commitment available only upon the usual mental‑illness‑plus‑dangerousness showing. This honors victims’ safety while avoiding the expressive endorsement that a justification would entail.

This is a tight gate by design. In practice, only a small subset of violent cases will clear it; those are precisely the cases in which full condemnation would do the most damage to the law’s claim to fairness.

---

### Speaker: Host

Building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions, sketch the concrete gatekeeping architecture you would adopt: (i) a Daubert-style pretrial hearing protocol (who bears what burdens, required proffer, use of neutral court experts, exclusion criteria like voluntary intoxication), and (ii) a model, one‑paragraph jury instruction that cabins the excuse to reactive violence with clear‑and‑convincing proof of substantial volitional impairment caused by documented RSB exposures. Please be specific about what evidence the jury may and may not consider and how to handle malingering and state–trait confounds.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Short answer first. None of the Stage 2 tools Prof. Santiago lists—stop‑signal/Stroop/WCST batteries, cortisol profiles, historic BLLs—can, standing alone, establish loss of volitional control at the moment of the offense. As Dr. Chen noted, they are neither offense‑time specific nor sufficiently discriminating by themselves. As a convergent bundle, however—tied to event‑level proof and pre‑offense documentation—they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of reactive dyscontrol in a narrow band of cases. The court’s job is to demand alignment across mechanism, history, and moment, and to police alternatives.

What I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold (all of the following)

1) Event signature (proximate, reactive, disorganized)
- Acute provocation with seconds–minutes latency; no meaningful cooling period.
- Disorganized execution; absence of luring, weapon staging, concealment, or other instrumental planning.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam, third‑party witnesses) of “seeing red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal. Post‑event confusion/amnesia can support but not carry the day.

2) Pre‑offense history of dyscontrol (nonforensic records)
- School/juvenile/medical records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound explosive reactivity, dissociation, or impulse‑control failures (e.g., IEPs, suspensions for fights, ED visits), and sleep disruption tied to neighborhood stressors. This addresses temporality and guards against reverse‑causation from the litigation setting.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity and relevance
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal Reaction Time, Go/No‑Go or antisaccade; include an affective variant such as emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop). WCST is less specific; I would down‑weight it.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) showing adequate effort; ideally stability across sessions.
- Trait profile consistent with reactive—not predatory—aggression (e.g., low‑to‑moderate psychopathy measures), used cautiously.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑diagnostic finding (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established by a qualified clinician, with symptom triggers and phenomenology plausibly explaining the index event, anchored to pre‑offense exposures. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) is supportive but not essential.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism (to keep the gate narrow, I would make this mandatory)
- Independent documentation predating litigation of at least one biological risk: childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or a peak ≥10), documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD indication. These do not time‑stamp the offense but materially strengthen causal plausibility when paired with current executive deficits.

And the following exclusionary screens must be satisfied
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; generally, voluntary intoxication should defeat the excuse.
- No primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI explaining the act (unless addressed under a different doctrine).
- No credible evidence of calculated, instrumental motive.
- Malingering safeguards satisfied (multiple PVTs; collateral consistency).

On the measures’ specificity and timing
- Inhibitory tasks (especially Stop‑Signal/antisaccade) are the most probative cognitive pieces but are state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation). Require standardized testing conditions and, where feasible, re‑testing or cross‑task convergence.
- Stroop taps interference control more than motor inhibition; keep it in the battery but don’t over‑weight.
- WCST is set‑shifting; least specific here.
- Hair cortisol gives a 2–3 month window for chronic load; single‑day salivary profiles are noisy. Treat endocrine findings as supportive, not determinative.
- Historic BLLs are developmental—not offense‑time—markers; probative only when aligned with prefrontal deficits and pre‑offense histories.

Key scientific/legal pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Favor pre‑offense records and standardized/replicated testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple validity indices; beware selective, “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; the law generally treats voluntary intoxication as non‑exculpatory.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑charge stress can create the very abnormalities proffered. Anchor opinions in pre‑charge documentation where possible.
- Adversarial allegiance/over‑claiming: Insist on court‑appointed neutral experts and Daubert scrutiny (known error rates, standards, peer acceptance).
- Base‑rate/ecological fallacy: Population correlations (e.g., ADI, ACEs) do not prove case‑level causation; they are Stage‑1 context, not Stage‑2 attribution.
- PCL‑R misuse and cultural bias in norms: Use with caution and explain limitations.
- Neuroimaging glamour effect: Given high Rule 403 risk and low incremental probative value, I would presumptively exclude fMRI/structural MRI offered as “proof” of dyscontrol; if admitted at all, only as background with a limiting instruction.

Procedural guardrails to preserve administrability and legitimacy
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the five pillars above; defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden on (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) substantial causal contribution to the act.
- Neutral, court‑appointed experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized templates for documentary proof; notice requirements.
- Limit applicability to reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.

Finally, to keep jury focus, I would give a tailored instruction: biomarkers and test scores are probabilistic context; they do not by themselves establish that the defendant lacked fair opportunity to conform at the critical moment. The question for the jury is whether, in light of all the evidence, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit the act in response to the provocation was substantially impaired at the time of offense, not merely that he has a general tendency toward poor control.

This is a narrow gate. Requiring convergence across event signature, pre‑offense history, validated cognitive deficits, clinical linkage, and at least one objective developmental insult—plus strict exclusions—will confine the excuse to the exceptional case and answer the floodgates concern while honoring Hart’s fairness limit.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming we adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution bundle, please draft a concise model jury instruction for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse that (i) states the defendant’s clear‑and‑convincing burden, (ii) enumerates the required converging findings and key disqualifiers (notably voluntary intoxication and evidence of planning), and (iii) limits applicability to reactive violent offenses. Also indicate whether you would deliver this in a bifurcated proceeding and what Daubert‑style pretrial findings you would require to keep the "battle of experts" within bounds.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen has it right on the science: no single instrument or biomarker is temporally precise enough to prove loss of control “at t.” If courts are to admit this at guilt, the law’s work is to demand tight convergence and to screen out state noise and advocacy science. My touchstones are Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit and administrability. Here is the minimum I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold, and only in reactive‑violence cases:

1) Event‑level signature (must have all)
- Temporal proximity: seconds to a few minutes after a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution.
- Corroboration: contemporaneous video/911/body‑cam or multiple percipient witnesses describing dissociation/“seeing red”/marked autonomic arousal; no concealment or instrumental follow‑through.

2) Pre‑offense documentation (must have both)
- Longitudinal dyscontrol: nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEPs/discipline, juvenile or ED notes, probation files) showing episodic, trigger‑bound loss of control or dissociation.
- Objective developmental insult: at least one hard, documentary indicator acquired before the offense (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or one ≥10; CPS‑substantiated severe neglect/abuse; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; prenatal exposure consistent with FASD risk; HUD/EPA lead hazard order affecting childhood residence).

3) Neurocognitive/clinical profile (must have all)
- Inhibition deficits: ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two tasks directly tapping inhibitory/affect control (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with valid SSRT, antisaccade, affective Stroop/Go–No‑Go), administered within 60–90 days, with multiple performance‑validity tests and, where feasible, a brief retest for stability.
- Psychiatric linkage: structured‑diagnostic PTSD (dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder with symptom content and timing plausibly mapping to the index event; corroborated by pre‑offense notes. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) are supportive, not dispositive.
- Trait profile: low/moderate psychopathy (to distinguish reactive from predatory aggression).

4) Exclusions/controls (all must be satisfied)
- Voluntary intoxication not a proximate driver (positive tox should presumptively defeat the excuse absent strong proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication).
- No primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; no acute TBI at offense; no strong instrumental motive.
- Malingering protections: multiple embedded/stand‑alone PVTs; cross‑source consistency; collateral informants.

Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health). Labs/assays must meet accreditation standards and report error rates.
- Narrow offense domain: impulsive interpersonal violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Jury management: bifurcation and a tailored instruction that “heightened anger” is insufficient; the question is substantial incapacity to conform conduct at the moment, proved by clear and convincing evidence. Experts barred from opining on the ultimate legal conclusion (FRE 704(b) logic).

Key pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medications can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Prefer pre‑offense records; standardize testing; consider actigraphy/collaterals on sleep.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifacts: weight pre‑charge documentation more heavily than post‑charge testing.
- Over‑interpretation of fMRI/EEG and single‑day salivary cortisol: admit only as supportive with clear limitations on specificity and timing.
- Resource asymmetry: without funding parity for indigent defendants, the gate will be inequitable; with it, the gate can remain narrow.

Disposition
Where the excuse is found, I would channel into noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision, with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. Where the bundle falls short, MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or structured sentencing mitigation keyed to validated deprivation/biological indicators should capture much of the moral force without overstretching guilt‑phase doctrine.

Bottom line: require alignment of history, mechanism, and moment. If any leg is missing—no pre‑offense documentation, no objective developmental insult, or event features look instrumental—the defense should not go to the jury. This keeps the doctrine faithful to Hart’s fairness limit and institutionally governable.

---

### Speaker: Host

Given Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions, what precise procedural architecture would you adopt to make a dyscontrol-based RSB excuse administrable and legitimate? Please be concrete: (i) the pretrial gatekeeping standard (e.g., Daubert hearing elements and who bears what burdens), (ii) whether you would bifurcate and, if so, propose concise jury-instruction language defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and its causal link to the instant act, and (iii) bright-line limits (e.g., exclusion when there is evidence of planning or voluntary intoxication). Keep the focus on one thing: the exact text of the instruction and the burdens you’d put on each side.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I find Professor Santiago’s two‑stage structure sound in principle but, as a matter of adjudication, Stage 2 must be pared to tools that are (a) generally accepted, (b) capable of independent corroboration, and (c) intelligible to jurors without inviting a battle of laboratories. Dr. Chen’s cautions are well taken: none of these instruments time‑stamps loss of control; they only raise or lower the probability. The law’s anchor remains Hart’s “fair opportunity to conform” — we are looking for substantial degradation of inhibitory control in a reactive, rapidly unfolding event, not an all‑purpose absolution for disadvantage.

What I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing burden, before the jury ever hears it, is a tight, convergent bundle with clear disqualifiers. In practice:

Procedural gatekeeping
- Notice and a pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing tethered to a checklist; the judge decides admissibility and sufficiency to go to the jury.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to reduce partisanship.
- Limit the doctrine to reactive interpersonal violence (seconds to minutes, affective aggression). Presumptive exclusion for planned acquisitive crimes or offenses showing preparation/ambush.

Minimum convergence (all five required)
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions (by witnesses, 911 audio, video, body‑cam) of “seeing red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal. Any evidence of weapon staging, traveling to the scene to confront, or post‑event instrumental behavior presumptively defeats the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- Records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile clinic notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption tied to neighborhood stress). This addresses temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact” concerns.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks that have general acceptance (e.g., Stop‑Signal or Go/No‑Go with valid SSRT, antisaccade, and preferably an affective variant such as emotional Go/No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests passed, and reasonable stability across sessions. Downweight WCST; it is not specific to the mechanism. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy scores (used cautiously) support an impulsive, not predatory, pattern.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to pre‑offense exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and dissociative/affective features of the event. Biological stress markers are supportive but not essential.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult preceding adolescence (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated or one ≥10; medically documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; credible FASD risk). These do not prove momentary dyscontrol; they make the measured executive deficits and the claimed mechanism more plausible.

Disqualifiers and controls (any one defeats or sharply weakens the claim)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate cause. If substances are present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; ordinarily, voluntary intoxication bars the excuse.
- Evidence of planning or instrumental motive (weapon retrieval, lying in wait, concealment, coordinated escape).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to documented RSB exposures (that is a different doctrine).
- Malingering: failure on multiple PVTs, “too bad to be true” profiles, or inconsistency across sessions.
- Testing conducted only after prolonged incarceration without corroborating pre‑offense records (risk of reverse‑causation via custody‑related stress).

On the measures themselves
- Neurocognitive batteries are admissible, with the caveats above. They should not lead; they should corroborate pre‑offense records and the event signature.
- Cortisol: single‑day salivary profiles are too noisy; hair cortisol can index chronic load over ~3 months, but courts should treat it as supportive only and be mindful of confounds (hair treatments, ethnicity).
- Historic blood lead levels are probative if taken during sensitive developmental windows and documented outside litigation; they are never dispositive.
- fMRI/advanced imaging: absent stronger consensus of forensic utility, I would exclude or admit only for limited corroboration with a strong Rule 403 screen to avoid undue prejudice.

Jury management and instructions
- Bifurcate: guilt first; if the gate is met, give a focused “reactive dyscontrol” instruction keyed to “no fair opportunity to conform,” not to global blameworthiness. Provide model language and a special verdict on the excuse to preserve appellate review and public clarity.
- Make clear that poverty or adversity alone is insufficient; the People may defeat the excuse by proving planning, intoxication, or adequate opportunity to refrain.

Disposition
- If excused, use ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, removal from criminogenic housing, nutrition and sleep stabilization, employment supports) with risk management; reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous and meet mental‑illness criteria. Victims’ rights must be honored at disposition.

Why this is administrable
- Requiring (1) an event‑level reactive signature, (2) pre‑offense dyscontrol documentation, (3) valid neurocognitive deficits, (4) a diagnosis that maps to the event, and (5) an objective developmental insult — plus the explicit disqualifiers — will keep this to a narrow class. Most violent cases will fail at the planning/intoxication screen or the pre‑offense documentation prong.

Finally, the scientific pitfalls the court should be most alert to are the ones Dr. Chen outlined: state–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, medication changes), malingering, intoxication effects masquerading as dyscontrol, and post‑charge stress altering biomarkers. The antidote is conservative gatekeeping, heavy reliance on pre‑charge records, neutral expertise, and carefully cabined jury instructions. This preserves the fairness principle without opening the floodgates or undermining the expressive function of the criminal law.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming we adopt a narrow dyscontrol excuse as sketched by Santiago and Chen, could you draft the core elements of a pattern jury instruction that (i) anchors culpability in Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit, (ii) confines the defense to reactive, affective violence, and (iii) expressly excludes voluntary intoxication and planned/instrumental conduct? Please specify the burden and standard of proof and any special verdict findings you’d require to aid appellate review.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage structure and with Dr. Chen’s “convergence” requirement. For courts, the question is not whether any single test proves moment‑of‑offense loss of control (none does), but whether a tightly specified bundle, anchored in pre‑offense records and event‑level features, can carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden without inviting mini‑trials on speculative science.

1) What I would accept at Stage 2 (clear and convincing) as a minimally sufficient bundle
All five prongs below should be present; any one missing should presumptively defeat the excuse.

- Event signature (indispensable)
  • Rapid escalation after a salient trigger; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous manifestations (e.g., “went blank,” tremor, panic), corroborated where possible by 911/body‑cam/video.
  • Evidence of planning, concealment, or instrumental motive defeats the claim.

- Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (indispensable)
  • Nonforensic records predating the offense (school/IEP, juvenile mental health, ED visits, CPS) showing episodic, stimulus‑bound outbursts, dissociation, or explosive reactivity, and chronic sleep disturbance. This addresses temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation and malingering.

- Neurocognitive profile with validity safeguards
  • Deficits ≥1.5 SD below age/education‑adjusted norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks that map to the mechanism (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go SSRT; antisaccade; an affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with:
    – Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone).
    – Either replication across two sessions or cross‑task convergence.
  • Downweight WCST; do not rely on it alone. Treat PCL‑R cautiously (used only to rule out predatory profile).

- Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
  • Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the offense. Collateral informant reports preferred over self‑report alone.

- Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
  • At least one independently documented developmental insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated or ≥10 once; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; medically substantiated prenatal alcohol exposure), predating the deficits. Hair cortisol (3‑month window) or flattened diurnal profiles may corroborate chronic stress but are not determinative.

Mandatory exclusions and controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; if substances present, defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, and malingering (multiple PVTs, consistency checks).
- Testing as early as practicable (ideally within 30–60 days), with standardized sleep/meds/caffeine conditions; rely heavily on pre‑charge records.

2) On specificity and temporal sensitivity
- None of the proposed tests/biomarkers time‑stamp dyscontrol to the second; they are trait‑leaning indicators. Their probative value arises only in alignment with (a) event‑level reactivity, and (b) pre‑offense documentation. Courts should treat hair cortisol, diurnal cortisol, HRV, and historic BLLs as supportive context, not as dispositive evidence.

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress will depress executive performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing; repeat or corroborate; give primacy to pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity measures; be alert to “too bad to be true” or selective deficits.
- Reverse causation: avoid over‑weighting post‑charge changes; hair cortisol can capture pre‑offense months; again, pre‑offense school/medical records are key.
- Neuro‑overclaiming: fMRI/EEG should be admitted, if at all, as pedagogic corroboration under strict Daubert limits; they rarely add incremental, case‑specific probative value over well‑done clinical and neuropsychological evidence.

4) Administrability guardrails (to avoid floodgates)
- Offense domain: limit to reactive violent offenses (and a very narrow residual of truly impulsive nonviolent episodes). Exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden: clear and convincing on (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) substantial causal contribution in the instant act.
- Procedure: pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tethered to a standardized proffer checklist; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health) to review raw data; notice requirements; geocoded exposure histories; documentary corroboration templates.
- Equality: fund indigent defendants to meet the same evidentiary load; otherwise the doctrine will be both underused and unequal.

5) Disposition
- If excused, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions with court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from high‑violence zones, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines). Civil commitment remains available where a qualifying mental disorder plus dangerousness is shown. Victims’ input should be incorporated; public‑safety conditions enforced.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 elements, refined as above, are workable in a narrow band of cases. Dr. Chen is right: no single assay proves momentary dyscontrol; convergence plus strong event phenomenology and pre‑offense documentation can. With tight Daubert gatekeeping, offense limits, and neutral expertise, this remains a rare excuse—consistent with Hart’s fairness limit and with institutional legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions as givens, what procedural architecture would you implement to make this administrable and legitimate to juries? Please be concrete: (i) Daubert/Rule 702 screen—what instruments or biomarkers would you categorically exclude or require (e.g., fMRI, WCST, hair cortisol, historic BLLs, PCL‑R); (ii) burdens and special verdicts—would you require separate jury findings on (a) substantial impairment and (b) causal contribution, under clear‑and‑convincing; (iii) bifurcation—guilt first, then RSB‑excuse phase with neutral court‑appointed experts; and (iv) model limiting instruction language to avoid moral confusion (e.g., distinguishing mitigation from excuse, excluding voluntary intoxication).

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Two framing points from the bench. First, none of these instruments can “time‑stamp” loss of control; they are circumstantial. Second, because the error costs of a false positive are high (acquittal of a responsible violent actor), a clear‑and‑convincing standard with tight gatekeeping is warranted. Within that frame, Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally sound, and Dr. Chen’s cautions are well‑taken. Here is how I would calibrate it for courtroom use.

1) Sufficiency of the proposed measures
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal, Go/No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) are probative of trait inhibitory weakness, not momentary incapacity. They can support, but never establish alone, substantial volitional impairment at the offense.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic BLLs speak to mechanism and temporality; they do not answer the “instant offense” question but can strengthen plausibility when aligned with event features.
- fMRI/EEG should be treated as demonstrative, not determinative, and generally excluded absent strong Daubert showings on reliability and error rates for the claimed inference.

2) Minimum convergence to meet clear‑and‑convincing
I would require all A–D, plus at least one item from E; the presence of any disqualifier under F defeats the excuse.

A. Event signature (contemporaneously corroborated)
- Rapid escalation (seconds to a few minutes) after salient provocation; disorganized conduct; no luring, staging, or concealment; 911/body‑cam/video or neutral witness accounts of dissociation/“seeing red”/marked autonomic arousal.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (nonforensic)
- School/juvenile/clinical records predating the offense reflecting stimulus‑bound rages, dissociation, or explosive reactivity; sleep disruption patterns; not created post‑charge.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal; antisaccade; affective Go/No‑Go/affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and reasonable stability across sessions; low–moderate psychopathy trait profile to fit reactive (not predatory) aggression.

D. Clinical linkage that maps to the event
- Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index event and anchored to pre‑offense exposures; physiological stress corroboration (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective exposure biomarker/history consistent with mechanism (at least one)
- Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or a prior ≥10); or documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia; or well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk; or verified chronic sleep disruption from environmental stressors. These should predate the measured deficits.

F. Disqualifiers/controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; strong evidence of instrumental planning/motive; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; malingering (failed PVTs/invalid profile); acute TBI at the offense. Any one defeats the claim.

3) Scientific/legal pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing conditions; favor replication and pre‑offense records to avoid post‑charge artifact.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; distrust “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Post‑offense contamination: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress executive performance—hence the premium on historic labs and records.
- Norming and bias: ensure tests use appropriate demographic norms; avoid over‑reliance on PCL‑R in populations where it performs poorly.
- Expert shopping: appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; hold rigorous Daubert hearings (reliability, error rate, general acceptance).

4) Offense‑domain limits and procedure
- Confine the excuse to truly reactive violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes (reserve RSB for sentencing mitigation there).
- Pretrial notice and structured proffer; bifurcation with a specialized instruction clarifying that heightened emotion is insufficient—the impairment must have substantially degraded the capacity to inhibit the act in the moment.
- Defense bears the clear‑and‑convincing burden on two prongs: (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

5) Disposition
- Where the excuse is found, favor ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused treatment, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep support, employment services), with civil commitment available only upon the usual mental‑illness/dangerousness showing. Incorporate victim‑protection conditions and meaningful review.

Bottom line: the proposed batteries and markers, standing alone, are not specific or temporally precise enough. As a convergent bundle—anchored by event‑level evidence and pre‑offense documentation, with neutral expert vetting—they can carry a clear‑and‑convincing showing in a narrow class of reactive cases. That is the administrable middle ground: morally responsive, rule‑governed, and tight enough to avoid floodgates.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assume the court recognizes a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the lines Prof. Santiago outlined and Dr. Chen vetted. From an administrability perspective, please translate Stage 2 into (i) a model gatekeeping order and (ii) a plain‑English jury instruction. Specify the elements the defense must prove (and by what burden), the required types of corroboration, and bright‑line disqualifiers (e.g., voluntary intoxication, planning). Also indicate whether you would bifurcate the proceeding and what the verdict form should say to preserve public legitimacy and guide ESB‑oriented dispositions.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m largely aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s scientific cautions. From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, here’s how I would translate Stage 2 into workable courtroom standards.

1) What the science can and cannot do
- None of the proposed tests or biomarkers time‑stamp loss of control; they are not specific enough standing alone. They can, however, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial inhibitory failure when they converge with event‑level features and pre‑offense records.
- Courts should treat neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop/Go–No‑Go) as functional probes of inhibition/affect regulation; WCST has low specificity and should be downweighted. fMRI/EEG should be admissible, if at all, only as background, not as proof of impairment in the moment.

2) Minimum convergence I would require to reach clear and convincing
All of the following, with no single item sufficient:
- Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
  - Rapid escalation after a salient provocation (seconds to a few minutes), disorganized execution, no luring or concealment; corroboration from video/911/bodycam or multiple witnesses preferred; contemporaneous “saw red/blanked out” descriptions are supportive but not dispositive.
- Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
  - School/juvenile/clinical records predating the offense reflecting stimulus‑bound rage, dissociation, explosive outbursts, or chronic sleep disruption; not created for litigation.
- Neurocognitive deficits with validity safeguards
  - At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade error rate, affective Go–No‑Go), documented within 60–90 days, with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and, ideally, cross‑session or cross‑test stability; include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available. Low–moderate psychopathy/antisocial trait scores to fit a reactive, not predatory, profile.
- Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
  - Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptom triggers plausibly tied to the incident and anchored in pre‑charge history. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) are supportive but not essential.
- Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
  - Independent documentation of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or any ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk) that temporally precedes and plausibly contributes to current deficits.

And all disqualifiers ruled out:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver (alcohol/stimulants) defeats the excuse; background RSB does not convert intoxication into an excuse.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time, or clear instrumental motives/planning.
- Malingering: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity checks; consistency across sessions; collateral informants.

3) Scientific pitfalls the court should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, or incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions where feasible; weigh pre‑offense records heavily.
- Reverse causation: avoid over‑reliance on post‑charge data; look for pre‑charge pediatric/school/CPS/EPA/housing records.
- Over‑interpretation: treat hair/diurnal cortisol and historic BLLs as plausibility enhancers, not as moment‑of‑offense proof.
- Coaching/secondary gain: insist on robust validity assessment and neutral experts.

4) Procedural safeguards to keep the gate tight and fair
- Notice and proffer: require a detailed pretrial proffer tied to specified elements; hold a Rule 702/Daubert hearing; make written findings on each element.
- Neutral expertise: appoint court‑engaged neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental‑health experts to review both sides’ work; require performance‑validity testing.
- Offense domain: limit to genuinely reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden and standard: defense bears clear and convincing proof that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Resource parity: ensure indigent defendants can access records (school, medical, CPS, housing, EPA, unemployment insurance), testing, and experts; otherwise the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

5) Limiting principles and jury management
- Bifurcation and instructions: after the jury finds actus reus and basic mens rea, instruct on a narrow dyscontrol excuse in a responsibility phase. Define “substantial impairment” as a great reduction in the ability to inhibit a strong, provoked impulse, not mere anger, poor judgment, or difficulty. Require “substantial contributing cause.”
- Exclude ultimate‑issue testimony: experts may not opine that the defendant “lacked control at the moment”; they describe deficits, mechanisms, and fit to event features.
- Preserve public legitimacy: emphasize that this is an excuse, not a justification; the act remains wrongful.

6) Disposition if the excuse is found
- ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision tailored to the mechanisms identified (trauma‑focused therapy, sleep/nutrition, housing relocation, lead abatement follow‑up, job pipelines), with risk assessment and judicial review. Civil commitment remains available where mental illness renders the person dangerous.

7) How this fits within a narrow RSB architecture
- This dyscontrol track should remain rare and sit alongside two other avenues I support: MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance in homicide (mitigation, not excuse), and structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators (e.g., chronic unemployment, lead/malnutrition history, documented trauma). I remain opposed to RSB‑as‑justification and to broad societal‑fault apportionment at guilt.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 factors, pruned to inhibition‑specific tasks and anchored in pre‑offense documentation and event phenomenology, can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a small subset of cases. Dr. Chen is right that courts must be vigilant about state effects, malingering, intoxication, and reverse causation. With tight gatekeeping, neutral expertise, and disciplined instructions, we can honor Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply—without opening the floodgates or losing the jury.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as the scientific ceiling, how would you translate this into an administrable courtroom framework? Please be concrete: (i) Daubert/Rule 702 gatekeeping criteria and a pretrial checklist you would require before the jury ever hears RSB‑dyscontrol evidence; (ii) the burden/standard of proof and any categorical exclusions (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, planned acquisitive offenses); and (iii) a short, pattern jury instruction that focuses jurors on whether inhibitory control was substantially degraded and a substantial cause of the act, without inviting general sympathy for hardship. Also, briefly weigh the error costs you’re willing to tolerate—what’s the right balance between Type I (excusing the culpable) and Type II (punishing the blameless) errors here?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen on the central scientific point: none of these instruments is time‑stamped to the moment of offense. The law will have to rely on circumstantial alignment between (i) how the event unfolded and (ii) stable, pre‑existing impairments plausibly produced by documented exposures. That means the event signature is primary; lab measures are corroborative.

Are the proposed tools specific/temporal enough?
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go (with a defensible SSRT) and an affective inhibition task (affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop) are the most probative for inhibitory control; WCST is too nonspecific and should be down‑weighted. All testing must include multiple performance‑validity tests and, ideally, repeat or cross‑task convergence to blunt state noise.
- Stress/exposure markers: Hair cortisol (3‑month window) is more robust than single‑day salivary profiles but still nonspecific and susceptible to confounds. Historic childhood lead levels (BLLs) and other developmental insults (iron deficiency, FASD risk) are not momentary indicators but, when paired with inhibition deficits, strengthen causal plausibility. None of these should be treated as dispositive; they are “links in the chain.”

Minimum converging bundle (clear‑and‑convincing) for a dyscontrol excuse
I would require all of the following five pillars, plus the stated disqualifiers:

1) Event‑level reactive signature (indispensable)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions of dissociation (“saw red,” “went blank”) or marked autonomic arousal; preferably corroborated by video/911/body‑cam or neutral witnesses. If there is planning or post‑event instrumental behavior, the defense should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school discipline/IEPs for explosive episodes, prior ED visits for rage, juvenile MH notes) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control. This is the best guard against reverse causation and “forensic artifact.”

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity (mechanism)
- At least two inhibitory/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective inhibition task), stable across sessions or converging across tasks, with intact performance‑validity indices. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available. Low–moderate psychopathy/antagonism (e.g., PCL‑R not in the high range) supports a reactive—not predatory—profile but should be used cautiously.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event (phenomenology)
- A structured DSM‑5 diagnosis pertinent to dyscontrol (PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), established by a qualified clinician and tied to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the index trigger and response. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult or environmental biomarker (dose–response)
- At least one independently documented developmental insult consistent with the proposed mechanism (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, repeated or a peak ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; FASD risk; chronic sleep disruption with collateral documentation). The exposure must predate the impairments and align with them (dose–response logic).

Disqualifiers/controls (any one should defeat the excuse)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver.
- Strong evidence of calculated, instrumental motive (financial gain, retaliation planned in advance), luring, weapon staging, or concealment.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to the proffered environmental pathway.
- Malingering or noncredible effort (failed PVTs, “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” patterns).
- Testing performed only after prolonged incarceration without pre‑offense corroboration.

Scientific/forensic pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, legal stress depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize conditions, repeat testing where feasible, and lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; require consistency across sessions and with collateral histories.
- Acute intoxication: Distinguish historic toxins (lead) from acute substances; voluntary intoxication should generally bar the excuse.
- Reverse causation: Post‑offense stress can mimic “chronic stress” profiles; hair cortisol helps, but pre‑charge documentation is better.
- Over‑interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI/EEG should be admissible, if at all, only as supportive and subjected to Daubert and Rule 403 to avoid “brain scan glamour.”
- Measurement bias: Be alert to cultural/SES bias in test norms and instruments (including PCL‑R); prefer measures with diverse normative samples.
- Multiple comparisons/fishing: Large test batteries invite false positives; require a priori linkage to inhibition/affect regulation, not shotgun testing.
- “Dueling experts” and culture shopping: Use court‑appointed neutral experts; cap the number of experts; bar ultimate‑issue testimony (“lacked substantial capacity”) while permitting mechanism opinions.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the five pillars; defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden.
- Notice requirements and standardized templates for documentary proof (school/CPS/medical/EPA‑HUD/UI/geocoded residence histories).
- Neutral court‑appointed experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Cabining: limit to reactive interpersonal violence (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.

Bottom line on specificity/temporality
These measures cannot pinpoint loss of control to the instant; the law should not ask them to. They can, in a narrow class of cases, make it highly likely that (i) the defendant carried a stable, exposure‑linked inhibition deficit and (ii) the index act bore the hallmarks of reactive dyscontrol. Requiring all five pillars—and disqualifying on planning or intoxication—keeps this in the automatism‑adjacent lane I favor, not a general invitation to litigate poverty at guilt. Evidence falling short of this bundle should remain available at sentencing as structured mitigation.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence as a working standard, how would you translate this into administrable law: specifically, (a) a Daubert/gatekeeping protocol (notice, proffer checklist, use of neutral court‑appointed experts), and (b) a model jury instruction with special interrogatories that define “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause” under a clear‑and‑convincing burden—while cabining voluntary intoxication? Please be concrete about wording and whether you’d use bifurcation.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Dr. Chen has it right on the science: none of these measures time‑stamps loss of control; the only honest path is convergence. From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, I would adopt a tight Stage‑2 bundle, make the defense carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden, and confine the instruction to reactive interpersonal violence.

What is probative enough
Require all of the following five pillars, with per se disqualifiers. No single element suffices.

1) Event signature (moment matters)
- Hallmarks: sudden escalation within seconds/minutes of a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous “went blank/seeing red” reports; corroboration where possible (911 audio, video, body‑cam, witness statements).
- Per se disqualifiers: meaningful planning or preparation; instrumental motive (profit/revenge planning); significant post‑offense concealment beyond panic flight.

2) Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control: school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, pediatric or behavioral health notes, juvenile probation notes, prior ED visits for rage/dissociation, sleep disruption documentation.
- This guards against reverse causation (forensic artifact) and state effects.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity (mechanism)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT; antisaccade; an affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and consistency across sessions; downweight WCST (set‑shifting) and avoid over‑reliance on generic Stroop.
- Trait profile inconsistent with predation (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage (plausibility)
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to pre‑offense exposures, with symptom content mapping the index trigger and response.
- Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) admissible only as supportive; not required and not dispositive.

5) Objective exposure biomarker (dose–response)
- At least one developmental insult documented independent of litigation (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or any ≥10; documented FASD risk; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive windows) with a plausible link to current executive deficits.

Necessary exclusions and controls
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as proximate driver defeat the excuse (absent rare involuntary intoxication).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB: litigate under insanity, not RSB dyscontrol.
- Malingering: require a validity‑positive test battery and collateral informants; be wary of “too bad to be true” patterns.
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine), prefer early testing (within 30–60 days) and pre‑offense records; repeat where feasible.

On the proposed tools’ specificity and timing
- Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the best of an imperfect lot for inhibition; include an affective variant because many triggers are emotional. WCST adds little here.
- Cortisol (especially single‑day saliva) is noisy; hair cortisol is better for chronic load but remains supportive only. Historic BLLs are probative of developmental insult if recorded in early childhood; they do not speak to the moment but strengthen plausibility when paired with current deficits.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
- All five pillars satisfied, plus no disqualifiers. Practically: (1) event‑level reactive profile with corroboration; (2) pre‑charge records of explosive dyscontrol; (3) two or more validated inhibition deficits; (4) a structured diagnosis that maps to the event; (5) one objective developmental insult. Anything less drops you into mitigation at sentencing, not excuse.

Judicial gatekeeping and safeguards
- Pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) and standardized templates for records (schools, CPS, medical, housing/EPA, juvenile).
- Notice requirement; early testing; in camera review of sensitive records to manage prejudice.
- Limit instruction to reactive violent offenses; do not extend to planned acquisitive crime. For homicides, channel many hard cases to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (mitigation) rather than full excuse.

Jury instruction (sketch)
- “You may consider this defense only if you find, by clear and convincing evidence, that at the time of the act the defendant’s inhibitory control was substantially degraded by cumulative, documented deprivation‑related insults, and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act. Evidence of a difficult background, standing alone, is insufficient. If substantial voluntary intoxication was the proximate cause, the defense fails.”

Disposition
- If excused, impose ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions with close supervision; reserve civil commitment for those who remain dangerous under existing standards. Otherwise, consider RSB at sentencing under validated mitigation frameworks (toxins, chronic deprivation).

Principal scientific/legal pitfalls to watch
- State–trait confounds and reverse causation (post‑charge stress effects) — rely on pre‑offense records and, where used, hair cortisol for pre‑event windows.
- Malingering/secondary gain — multiple validity measures and collateral verification.
- Acute intoxication — separate from chronic toxin history; generally defeats excuse.
- Over‑interpretation of neuro‑biomarkers (fMRI/EEG/cortisol) — treat as supportive context, not proof of momentary loss of control.

Bottom line
Dr. Chen’s convergence model is the right spine. Courts should insist on the full bundle, keep the domain narrow, and channel close calls to structured mitigation. That preserves Hart’s fairness limit while managing error costs and public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle, what concrete gatekeeping architecture would you put in place to make this administrable? I’m looking for specifics: (i) a pretrial Daubert‑style protocol (what must be shown, by whom, and with what records/tests) and the burden/standard; (ii) a narrowly drafted pattern jury instruction for the dyscontrol excuse (elements and disqualifiers in plain language); and (iii) whether you would require bifurcation and court‑appointed neutral experts. Please also flag the main error‑cost you are designing against and how you’d preserve appellate review without inviting mini‑trials on every deprivation factor.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s core point: none of these instruments time‑stamps volitional failure; they corroborate, they don’t prove it. If we are to use them at guilt, they must come in only after a rigorous Daubert gate and only as part of a tightly defined, convergent bundle that links mechanism, history, and the moment. Here is how I would translate that into judicial standards.

1) Admissibility and burden
- Burden/standard: Defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.
- Offense domain: Presumptively limited to reactive violent offenses with acute provocation; exclude planned acquisitive crime and staged retaliation.
- Gatekeeping: Pretrial Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Require production of raw test data, validity indices, protocols, and pre‑offense records. Funding parity for indigent defendants (Ake‑style appointments), or the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.
- Notice/timing: Written notice and structured proffer (with exhibits) at least 60 days pretrial; testing conducted as early as practicable (target 30–60 days post‑offense) and standardized (sleep, meds) or repeated; heavy weight on pre‑charge documentation to avoid forensic artifacts.

2) Minimum convergence required (no single item is sufficient)
I would require all of A–E below, plus the disqualifiers not present:

A. Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; absence of planning/cover‑up. Prefer contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/bodycam, witness descriptions of “went blank,” autonomic arousal).

B. Pre‑offense history of dyscontrol (nonforensic)
- School/juvenile/clinical records predating the charge showing stimulus‑bound outbursts, dissociation, or explosive reactivity; sleep disruption documentation where relevant.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and cross‑task convergence or retest stability.
- Downweight WCST; admit as supportive only. Treat functional neuroimaging as generally excludable at guilt (Rule 403) or, if admitted, strictly corroborative.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive—not predatory—aggression (e.g., low‑to‑moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the offense (triggers, dissociation). Biological stress indices (e.g., hair cortisol flatting, low resting HF‑HRV) are supportive, not required.

E. Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult predating adolescence (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated, or ≥10 once; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; documented FASD risk). These are not momentary measures but strengthen plausibility when paired with C and D.

3) Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; “history of use” is not enough.
- Clear instrumental planning (luring, weapon staging, concealment) defeats the excuse.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures belongs in insanity/diminished‑capacity channels, not here.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, cross‑source consistency, and retest when feasible.
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing conditions; where possible, replicate; rely on pre‑offense records to blunt reverse‑causation (incarceration stress) and transient state effects.

4) Specificity and temporal sensitivity of the tools
- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with properly estimated SSRT) and antisaccade are the most task‑specific; Stroop is less specific; WCST is largely nonspecific here.
- Diurnal salivary cortisol is noisy; a 3‑cm hair segment offers a 3‑month window and is modestly more robust, but both are supportive only and subject to confounds (hair treatment, ethnicity).
- Historic BLLs are probative of developmental insult when collected in sensitive windows; they do not speak to the moment but, combined with current inhibitory deficits, support causation.

5) Jury management and instructions
- Bifurcation: Try guilt with a specialized instruction that this is an excuse (not a justification); it neither blames the victim nor authorizes resistance by others. If the excuse fails, Stage‑1 deprivation evidence is generally inadmissible on elements (Rule 403).
- Instruction on “substantial impairment”: The question is whether, in light of defendant’s documented exposures and impairments, inhibitory control at the time was so degraded that the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to refrain—Hart’s fairness limit, not a general license to shift blame to society.

6) Disposition if excuse is found
- Default to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports) under judicial supervision, with civil commitment only if the person remains demonstrably dangerous. This speaks to public safety and preserves legitimacy.

7) Pitfalls courts should police most closely
- State–trait confounds (sleep loss, meds, acute stress) masquerading as trait deficits.
- Reverse causation (post‑charge stress flattening cortisol/impairing performance).
- Malingering/secondary gain on cognitive tests and symptom inventories.
- Over‑interpretation of weakly specific biomarkers (hair/salivary cortisol, single‑session Stroop) and undue reliance on WCST.
- PCL‑R misuse; it is not a “bad character” proxy and should not be used to defeat otherwise solid dyscontrol evidence absent clear predatory patterns.
- Intoxication creep: voluntary intoxication should not be bootstrapped into dyscontrol.

Bottom line: with this convergence requirement and these disqualifiers, the Stage‑2 showing is administrable and rare. It remains faithful to the fairness limit on punishment, does not collapse into broad “societal fault,” and keeps the floodgates closed by demanding alignment among event, history, impairment, and exposure.

### Speaker: Host

Assuming, arguendo, we adopt Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence and Prof. Santiago’s clear‑and‑convincing standard, how would you translate this into trial practice without losing the jury? Specifically: what would your model jury instructions and verdict form look like to focus jurors on (i) whether the defendant’s inhibitory control was substantially impaired at the time of the offense, and (ii) whether the act was reactive rather than instrumental, while applying a clear‑and‑convincing burden? Please be concrete—one or two short instruction paragraphs, any special interrogatories you would add, and any categorical limits you would instruct on (e.g., voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse). Also note whether you’d bifurcate and issue a pretrial order cabining expert testimony (Daubert/Rule 702) to particular propositions to minimize prejudice.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 moves in the right direction. I agree with Dr. Chen: none of these instruments can “time‑stamp” loss of control; the law must demand convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment. If we are to recognize a dyscontrol excuse at guilt, we need tight, rule‑governed criteria and strong gatekeeping.

On specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) are trait‑leaning proxies for inhibitory control; they support mechanism but cannot, alone, show momentary failure. WCST adds little and should be down‑weighted.
- Stress/insult markers (childhood BLLs, iron deficiency, hair/diurnal cortisol) speak to plausibility and dose, not the instant act.
- Therefore, contemporaneous, event‑level evidence (video/911/bodycam, eyewitness accounts of abrupt escalation/dissociation, disorganized execution) carries the temporal weight; the tests and biomarkers corroborate.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
Require all five, with no single component sufficient:

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid provocation‑to‑act interval; no luring or staging; chaotic execution; contemporaneous reports of “seeing red/blanking,” marked autonomic arousal; post‑event confusion is supportive.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records pre‑dating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile/clinical notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits), establishing temporality.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go), replicated or cross‑validated; intact performance‑validity indices; low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits to fit an impulsive, not predatory, phenotype.

4) Psychiatric linkage mapping to the event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD–dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the index trigger; biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one biological insult (childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or ≥10 once; documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency; credible FASD risk), consistent with current executive deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver; clear instrumental planning/cover‑up; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; high psychopathy with predatory pattern; malingering (failures on multiple PVTs); testing performed only post‑charge without pre‑offense corroboration.

Scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, meds, incarceration stress) depressing test scores or cortisol; mitigate with standardized conditions, repetition, and reliance on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain; insist on multiple validity checks and raw‑data disclosure.
- Reverse causation; prefer historic (pre‑charge) labs/records and hair cortisol over single‑day salivary assays.
- Neuroimaging over‑reach; fMRI/EEG are not case‑level diagnostic—admit, if at all, only as peripheral support with limiting instructions to avoid undue prejudice.

Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing keyed to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) with access to raw data; reciprocal discovery and notice.
- Defendant’s burden: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Offense domain: confine to reactive violent offenses (and only the rare, truly impulsive nonviolent outburst); presumptively exclude acquisitive, planned crime and cases with significant voluntary intoxication.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants, or the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

Jury instruction (sketch)
- “You may consider evidence of cumulative deprivation and biological insults only insofar as it bears on whether, at the time of the offense, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit action was substantially impaired. Sympathy for hardship is not a defense. The defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence that this impairment existed at the time and was a substantial factor in causing the act. Voluntary intoxication does not qualify.”

Disposition
- If established, enter a specialized verdict (e.g., “not responsible by reason of dyscontrol”) that triggers an ESB track: court‑supervised, noncarceral interventions (trauma‑focused care, stable housing away from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep remediation, employment supports), with risk‑responsive conditions and periodic judicial review. Use civil commitment only where statutory criteria for dangerousness are met.

Bottom line
The Santiago/Chen framework, tightened as above, can be administered without opening the floodgates. It hews to Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply—while preserving public legitimacy through narrow scope, neutral expertise, and disciplined proof.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Prof. Santiago’s and Dr. Chen’s proposals into courtroom-ready language by drafting: (a) a concise model jury instruction for a dyscontrol-based RSB excuse (elements, burden, offense limitation, exclusion of voluntary intoxication), and (b) a brief pretrial Daubert-style checklist for admissibility of the defense’s expert proof? Aim for clarity and administrability, and note any safeguards to minimize disparate application across defendants.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen has it right on the science: nothing we can admit today will time‑stamp a loss of control to the second. If we are to use a dyscontrol excuse at guilt, the law must demand tight convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment, and we must cabin the domain to reactive violence. Here is how I would translate Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 into a workable courtroom rule.

1) Offense domain and disqualifiers
- Domain: affective/reactive violent offenses with minimal planning (e.g., sudden assaults/homicides after salient provocation). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes, luring, weapon staging, or concealment behaviors.
- Disqualifiers (any one defeats the excuse):
  - Substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver.
  - Clear instrumental motive or post‑event manipulation.
  - Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures (that belongs in insanity).
  - Strong malingering indicators on validity testing.

2) Burden and procedure
- Burden: clear and convincing evidence that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Procedure: pretrial, Daubert‑style responsibility hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). 45–60 day notice with a structured proffer and documentary backups (public health labs, school/CPS, housing/EPA/HUD, unemployment records, geocoded residence history).
- Bifurcation: guilt first; if the actus reus and mens rea are proved, responsibility phase with specialized instructions.

3) Minimum convergence required (no single prong suffices)
A. Event signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; contemporaneous evidence of dissociation/“seeing red”/marked autonomic arousal (witnesses, 911/body‑cam, video). Any luring, weapon pre‑positioning, or concealment presumptively defeats.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits, longstanding sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive battery with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD impaired (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time; Go/No‑Go or antisaccade; an affective variant such as emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop).
- Include delay‑discounting as a choice impulsivity index.
- Multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive (not predatory) aggression; if PCL‑R is used, keep it in a supportive role and beware its limitations.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the index trigger and response.
- Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) may support the link but should not be required nor treated as determinative.

E. Objective exposure/biological insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation proof of at least one developmental insult plausibly tied to executive dysfunction: childhood blood lead levels ≥5 µg/dL (repeated or a prior ≥10), documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive periods, or credible FASD risk. These are not moment‑markers but strengthen causal plausibility given C and D.

4) Scientific pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing (sleep, meds, caffeine); prefer repeat or corroborated results; lean on pre‑offense records. Hair cortisol offers a pre‑offense window; single‑day salivary cortisol is too noisy.
- Malingering: multiple validity checks; watch for selective or “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Acute intoxication: treat as a categorical bar to the excuse; any RSB‑related addiction arguments belong, at most, in mitigation.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress degrades performance and cortisol; timing and pre‑offense documentation matter.
- Over‑interpretation of imaging/novel biomarkers: admit fMRI/EEG, if at all, as non‑determinative corroboration with limiting instructions.

5) Model instruction (responsibility phase)
“The issue is whether, because of severe environmental deprivation and its documented effects on the defendant’s brain and behavior, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an otherwise unlawful act was so substantially impaired at the time of the offense that he had no fair opportunity to conform his conduct to law. You must be clearly convinced that (1) the defendant experienced a sudden, provoked, reactive loss of control; (2) this loss of control was consistent with pre‑existing, documented dyscontrol; and (3) alternative explanations, such as planning or voluntary intoxication, do not better account for his conduct.”

6) Disposition if excused
- Noncarceral ESB conditions tailored to the mechanism (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports), with no‑contact orders, GPS where appropriate, periodic risk review, and swift revocation for noncompliance.
- Civil commitment remains available for those who remain demonstrably dangerous under ordinary standards; no “medicalization” absent statutory criteria.

7) Where to put the rest
- Many hard cases will not clear this gate. They should be heard at sentencing under structured mitigation tied to verified deprivation indicators (e.g., cumulative ADI/ICE exposure, ACEs, documented toxin exposure, school deprivation), with calibrated ranges—not at guilt.
- I would not adopt societal‑fault apportionment at guilt. It is conceptually mismatched to criminal adjudication and risks public legitimacy; comparative fault ideas fit better in a sentencing grid.

Why this remains narrow
- Requiring alignment across event features, pre‑offense records, validated neurocognitive deficits, a verified developmental insult, and exclusion of intoxication and planning will confine the excuse to a small fraction of reactive violence cases. In my experience, the administrability and equality concerns are addressed by codified thresholds, neutral experts, and bifurcation with focused instructions.

This respects Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair chance to comply—without inviting a free‑floating social critique at guilt. It leaves MPC‑style EED to do its work in homicide, and it moves broad RSB considerations to a structured sentencing phase, which is where they mostly belong.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions as givens, how would you operationalize this in court? Please propose (i) a concise model jury instruction for a dyscontrol excuse (elements, burden, and limiting language), and (ii) a pretrial gatekeeping order (notice, proffer contents, neutral experts, disqualifiers like voluntary intoxication, and the narrow offense domain). In other words, what, exactly, would you codify, and what would you exclude as too noisy or prejudicial for juries (e.g., hair cortisol, WCST, PCL‑R) to keep this administrable and legitimate?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Two points at the outset. First, no laboratory or imaging tool can time‑stamp “loss of control” to the moment of an offense. If we are to admit a dyscontrol excuse at guilt, it must be reserved for paradigmatic, reactive cases where mechanism, history, and moment line up. Second, the court’s job is to keep speculation away from the jury. That means a pretrial gate with specified elements, neutral experts, and a clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense.

On Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2: what helps, what doesn’t
- Event signature is indispensable. If the facts do not look like classic reactive aggression—near‑immediate eruption after a salient provocation, no luring or staging, disorganized execution, no concealment—stop there. Surveillance/911/body‑cam, contemporaneous witness descriptions of “blanking out,” and post‑event confusion carry far more weight than any test score.
- Neurocognitive tests can support, not carry, the inference. Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go and antisaccade tasks are the closest fit to inhibitory control; include an affective variant (emotional Go‑No‑Go/Stroop). WCST is a weak marker for inhibition; downweight it. Require multiple performance‑validity tests and, where feasible, retesting for stability. Use demographically corrected norms to blunt SES/race bias.
- Stress/Exposure markers are, by nature, trait evidence. Historic childhood blood‑lead levels (particularly repeated elevations or any ≥10 µg/dL) and documented early malnutrition are developmentally probative but not temporally specific. Diurnal salivary cortisol is noisy; if used at all, prefer hair cortisol (pre‑offense segment) and treat as supportive only. fMRI should be demonstrative at most; it does not diagnose individual incapacity.
- Clinical linkage matters. A structured diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established by a qualified clinician, tied to documented exposures and with symptom content that plausibly maps onto the index trigger, is probative. Overreliance on personality tools (e.g., PCL‑R) is risky; if used, keep to ruling out predatory profiles, not to “prove” dyscontrol.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)
All of the following, with no single item sufficient:

1) Reactive event signature
- Acute provocation; seconds–minutes to offense; lack of planning/cover‑up; contemporaneous evidence of dissociation or autonomic arousal. Any substantial planning, weapon staging, luring, or tactical flight should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive behavior, prior ED visits for rage episodes, juvenile mental health notes of dissociation/IED, sleep disruption impacting function). This addresses temporality and avoids post‑charge artifacts.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below demographically corrected norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), plus an impulsive choice measure (delay discounting) if available; intact performance‑validity indices (e.g., TOMM, embedded PVTs), and preferably replication or cross‑test convergence.

4) Clinical diagnosis that maps to the event
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis (PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified examiner, with symptoms and triggers plausibly explaining the index behavior; biological stress corroboration (e.g., pre‑offense hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independent, pre‑litigation biomarker or record (e.g., repeated childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL, early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, documented FASD risk), strengthening causal plausibility when paired with current executive deficits.

And all of these disqualifiers/controls:

- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances are present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; in general, do not excuse what alcohol or stimulants acutely caused.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple validity measures, consistency across sessions, and collateral informant reports. Be wary of “too bad to be true” or selective impairments.
- Alternative cause exclusion: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI, or clear instrumental motives.
- Timing safeguards: conduct testing as early as feasible (ideally within 30–60 days), but rely heavily on pre‑offense records; recognize that post‑offense incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and degrade performance.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication, pain, legal stress degrade performance; standardize testing conditions and, where possible, repeat.
- Base‑rate fallacy/adversarial allegiance: a moderate correlation at the group level does not prove individual causation; require convergence across independent domains and court‑appointed neutral experts.
- Cultural/SES bias in testing: insist on demographically corrected norms and qualified examiners.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: cortisol and imaging are not diagnostic of momentary incapacity.

Procedural guardrails
- Rule 104(a)/Daubert‑style pretrial hearing keyed to the elements above; appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; limit the doctrine to reactive interpersonal violence (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); exclude planned acquisitive crime and felony‑murder.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions. If the gate is cleared, instruct the jury that severe deprivation, standing alone, does not excuse; the question is whether, at the time of the act, inhibitory control was so substantially degraded that the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply. This is a higher bar than “made it much harder.”

Where to channel close cases
- Reserve a true excuse for tightly defined “involuntary‑rage automatism” cases and use MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance in homicide for the broader band of emotionally driven violence. Everything else belongs at sentencing, where verified deprivation indicators (e.g., chronic unemployment, lead exposure, childhood maltreatment) can mitigate without collapsing guilt standards.

Administered this way—with a demanding event signature, robust pre‑offense documentation, objective developmental insult, validated neurocognitive deficits, and strict exclusion of planning and intoxication—the doctrine will be rare, governable, and defensible to victims and the public. It respects Hart’s fairness limit without inviting a flood.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Santiago/Chen’s proposal into the courtroom: What would your gatekeeping order and a model jury instruction for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse look like? Please specify (i) the pretrial showing required (Daubert hearing, neutral experts, documentary thresholds), (ii) the burden/standard (e.g., clear and convincing) and how to define “substantial impairment” and causation to the instant act, and (iii) a tight instruction on disqualifiers like voluntary intoxication. Keep it administrable and jury‑friendly.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen’s bottom line. None of these instruments or biomarkers is temporally precise or specific enough, standing alone, to prove loss of volitional control at the moment of offense. The law can, however, admit a narrow dyscontrol excuse if it insists on convergence across independent strands that together show (i) a reactive, not instrumental, event; (ii) pre‑existing, documented impairment of inhibitory control; and (iii) exclusion of more ordinary drivers (intoxication, planning, malingering).

What I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold
- Event signature (contemporaneous, objective). Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous witnesses/video/911 describing “blanking,” marked autonomic arousal, or dissociation. If there is evidence of planning, cover‑up, or instrumental motive, the defense should presumptively fail.
- Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (nonforensic). School/juvenile records, IEPs, prior ED/clinic notes, CPS reports, showing stimulus‑bound explosive reactivity or dissociation predating the charge. This is the best antidote to reverse causation and forensic artifact.
- Neurocognitive findings with validity checks. At least two well‑validated inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, an affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), each ≥1.5 SD below norms, replicated or cross‑validated, with multiple performance‑validity tests passed. I would downweight WCST and classic Stroop; they’re nonspecific. A delay‑discounting task is useful corroboration. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits support a reactive (not predatory) profile, but should not be over‑read.
- Psychiatric linkage that maps to the event. A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD with dissociative features; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to pre‑charge exposures and triggers plausibly explaining the index conduct. Biological stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) are supportive only.
- Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism. At least one independently documented biological insult during sensitive periods (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; FASD risk), plus geocoded residence/lead‑hazard or comparable records. These do not time‑stamp the offense, but they anchor plausibility.

Mandatory exclusions and controls
- Voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute effects.
- Malingering safeguards: embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests, consistency over sessions, and collateral informants. “Too bad to be true” profiles should be discounted.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless separately addressed), acute TBI at the scene, or clear instrumental motives.
- Timing safeguards: testing as early as practicable, plus reliance on pre‑charge records to avoid incarceration‑induced changes.

Are the measures “sufficiently specific”?
- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with sound SSRT estimation) and antisaccade are the most relevant, but they remain trait‑leaning, state‑sensitive assays; they must be part of a bundle.
- Affective variants help because many assaults are emotion‑laden.
- Hair cortisol provides a multi‑month window; single‑day salivary profiles are noisy. Both are nonspecific to legal dyscontrol.
- Historic BLLs/early malnutrition are probative only as developmental risk markers, not moment‑of‑offense indicators.
- fMRI/EEG should be admitted, if at all, as corroborative education for the court, not proof of individual causation.

Scientific pitfalls courts should watch for
- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss, medications, pain, legal stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; consider actigraphy or collateral sleep documentation; prefer replication.
- Malingering/secondary gain. Use multiple validity measures; beware selective impairment patterns.
- Acute intoxication. Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication should not excuse.
- Reverse causation. Post‑offense jail stress changes physiology/performance; pre‑offense records are critical.
- Base‑rate/translation errors. Moderate group‑level effect sizes do not justify strong individual‑level inferences; lab tasks have limited ecological validity.
- Measure shopping and cultural bias. Require pre‑specified batteries, neutral experts, and normative adjustments where appropriate.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and legitimacy)
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing keyed to a standardized checklist mirroring the elements above; require defense notice and a structured proffer.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Parties may add retained experts, but the neutral report anchors the analysis.
- Confine the doctrine to genuinely reactive violent offenses (and, sparingly, to truly impulsive nonviolent episodes). Exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Tailored jury instruction: “substantial impairment” means no fair opportunity to conform conduct to law despite awareness of wrongfulness; correlation does not equal causation; biomarkers are supportive only.
- Bifurcation to protect the guilt phase from undue prejudice, with specialized instructions to avoid over‑crediting science that cannot time‑stamp the offense.

In sum: the proposed batteries and markers can support, but cannot by themselves establish, moment‑of‑offense dyscontrol. A tight, pre‑specified bundle—event signature, pre‑offense documentation, valid neurocognitive deficits, diagnostic linkage, and a developmental exposure marker, plus exclusion of alternatives—can satisfy a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a small subset of cases. That calibration respects Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit while containing error costs and preserving public confidence.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your evidence-and-administrability hat: if a jurisdiction were to adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle, how would you operationalize admissibility and jury guidance to keep error costs tolerable? Please be concrete. (i) Sketch a Daubert-style checklist identifying what is necessary and what is per se insufficient (e.g., WCST alone; single‑day salivary cortisol; ex post self-reports). (ii) Propose pattern instructions that define “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and limit the excuse to truly reactive episodes (and exclude planned/instrumental conduct). (iii) Where would you place the burden (clear-and-convincing?), and would you require bifurcation or special verdicts? Finally, what guardrails would you build against unequal access to experts and against dueling, confusing science overwhelming jurors?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m largely in the same place as Prof. Santiago and Dr. Chen on first principles: nothing in this science time‑stamps loss of control to the second; a dyscontrol excuse must rest on convergence across mechanism, history, and the moment; and courts must police the gate tightly.

Are the proposed tools specific and temporally sensitive enough?
- Standing alone, no. Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, and affective variants are the closest we have to inhibition, but they are state‑sensitive and probabilistic. Cortisol profiles (saliva or hair) and historic BLLs are chronic‑exposure markers, not moment‑of‑offense gauges.
- As a bundle tied to event‑level phenomenology and pre‑offense documentation, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a narrow class of reactive violent cases. That is the most the science can responsibly do, and it is enough if we keep the doctrine tight.

What I would require (clear and convincing; all must be satisfied) for a complete excuse (involuntary‑rage/automatism‑style) in a reactive violent offense:

1) Event signature (proximate, reactive, non‑instrumental)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; seconds to minutes, not hours.
- Disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, concealment, or post‑event instrumental steps.
- Contemporaneous indicia of dissociation/overarousal (e.g., 911/bodycam/witness: “went blank/seeing red,” trembling, tachycardia); post‑event confusion/amnesia is supportive but not sufficient.

2) Pre‑offense history (nonforensic)
- Records predating the offense that show stimulus‑bound loss of control or affective lability (e.g., school IEP/discipline, juvenile mental‑health notes, ED visits for explosive episodes, chronic sleep disruption documented by schools/clinics). This anchors temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal Reaction Time, antisaccade error rates, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact effort indices (multiple PVTs/embedded validity) and either replication across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Include a delay‑discounting/impulsive choice metric; de‑emphasize WCST (set‑shifting) and do not over‑weight Stroop alone.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (low–moderate PCL‑R or alternative), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom triggers plausibly explain the index event; corroborated by longitudinal notes predating the charge.
- Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair cortisol over a 3‑month window) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure marker consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult during sensitive windows: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or one ≥10); or iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; or well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk. Pair this with item 3 to satisfy plausibility and dose–response.

6) Exclusion of alternative proximate drivers
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause; if substances were present, the defense must prove baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time, malingering (multiple PVTs), and clear instrumental motives.

If this full bundle is not met but the record shows substantial affective disturbance under provocation, I would channel the case to partial mitigation:
- Homicide: MPC‑style Extreme Emotional Disturbance (manslaughter).
- Other offenses: sentencing mitigation, not a guilt‑phase excuse.

Procedural safeguards (administrability and equality)
- Narrow offense domain: presumptively limit the excuse to reactive violent offenses. Planned acquisitive crime should be out.
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured checklist tied to the six elements above; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden.
- Neutral experts: court‑appointed neuropsychologist, psychiatrist, and environmental health expert to review raw data and records.
- Notice and standardized documentation: geocoded deprivation histories; school/CPS/medical/EPA‑HUD/UI records; pre‑specified lab thresholds; performance‑validity documentation.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; without it, the doctrine is illusory and inequitable.
- Bifurcation and tailored jury instructions: instruct that poverty/trauma alone are insufficient; the question is whether cumulative, verified adversities substantially degraded inhibitory control so that the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform at the time. Caution against treating any single test or biomarker as determinative.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, custody stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing (sleep, meds, caffeine), rely on pre‑offense documentation, and consider repeat testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity indices; be wary of selective, “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: generally defeats the excuse; separate developmental “toxins” (lead, FASD) from voluntary substance effects.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑charge stress can produce the very abnormalities proffered; pre‑charge records are critical.
- Neuro‑novelty bias: default to excluding fMRI/EEG as proof of individual culpability; admit, if at all, only as limited, supportive context. Historic BLLs and hair cortisol can corroborate exposure/stress but do not prove momentary loss of control.

Disposition
- Where the complete excuse is found: acquittal with immediate risk assessment. If dangerousness stems from a qualifying disorder, civil commitment is available; otherwise, ESB‑oriented, court‑supervised conditions (trauma‑focused therapy, stable housing away from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, job placement). Victim‑safety measures (stay‑away, GPS, swift‑and‑certain sanctions for noncompliance) should be standard.
- Where only partial showing: EED (homicide) or structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators (e.g., chronic unemployment, lead exposure), with ESB conditions.

This strikes the balance I think our institutions can carry: a narrow, rule‑governed avenue for true involuntary‑rage/dyscontrol; MPC‑style mitigation where control was badly strained but not gone; and a robust sentencing lane. It honors Hart’s fairness limit without inviting a flood or eroding protection for communities that bear the brunt of street violence.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence and disqualifiers as our scientific backbone, how would you operationalize this in court? Please sketch (i) a pretrial gatekeeping protocol (Daubert/Kumho factors, required documentary proffer, use of neutral court‑appointed experts, burden and standard), and (ii) a concise model jury instruction that cabins the doctrine to reactive violent offenses, addresses voluntary intoxication, and delineates the scope of permissible expert testimony (including cautions on PCL‑R and no ultimate‑issue opinions). If you favor bifurcation, indicate what goes to the guilt phase versus a dyscontrol phase, and how to avoid jury confusion or expressive harm. Aim for administrable, pattern‑instruction style language.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m largely aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage structure and Dr. Chen’s cautions. If courts are to recognize a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse without losing their footing, we need a narrow offense domain, a demanding evidentiary bundle, and tight gatekeeping. My touchstones are Hart’s “fair opportunity to conform,” administrability, and error‑cost control.

1) Offense domain and disqualifiers
- Limit to reactive interpersonal violence: killings or serious assaults that erupt within seconds or minutes of a salient provocation.
- Disqualify where there is evidence of planning, luring, weapon staging, concealment, or clear instrumental motive.
- Disqualify moderate/high psychopathic trait profiles.
- Disqualify substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate cause.
- Treat primary psychosis/mania under insanity, not this doctrine.

2) Burden and standard
- Defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden that: (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded, and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act at the moment it occurred.

3) Gatekeeping (Rules 104(a)/702/Daubert) and procedure
- Notice: defense must file a structured proffer 60–90 days pretrial.
- Neutral experts: court‑appointed neuropsychologist, psychiatrist, and environmental health expert; parties may add retained experts.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Pretrial hearing: require documentary foundations; exclude showy but low‑utility modalities (individual‑level fMRI as proof of incapacity).

4) Minimum bundle required to reach the jury
No single item suffices; I would require convergence on all five pillars below.

A. Event‑level signature (proximal phenomenology)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a specific provocation; disorganized execution; no concealment; credible contemporaneous reports of “seeing red/blanking out,” marked autonomic arousal; ideally corroborated (video/911/body‑cam). If luring/planning appears, the defense fails.

B. Pre‑offense history of dyscontrol (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense documenting stimulus‑bound loss of control: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile/clinical notes of dissociation or Intermittent Explosive Disorder, ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption. This mitigates reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact” risks.

C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity and replication
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SDs below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal Reaction Time; antisaccade; affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus an impulsive choice measure (delay discounting), all with multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and either test–retest stability or cross‑task convergence. Downweight WCST; it’s non‑specific.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the trigger/response in the instant offense. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological adversity in sensitive windows that plausibly impairs prefrontal control (any one of: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or any ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑supported FASD risk; or an EPA/HUD lead hazard order at a childhood residence), tied to the individual’s current executive profile. These are history markers, not time‑stamps.

Mandatory exclusions/controls across pillars
- Toxicology: if alcohol/drugs plausibly drove the event, the excuse does not apply; evidence of baseline dyscontrol independent of substances is required where any use is present.
- Malingering: require multiple PVTs, internal consistency checks, and collateral informants; be alert to selective “too bad to be true” patterns.
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing conditions (sleep, caffeine, meds); when possible, repeat testing; rely on pre‑offense documentation to anchor trait‑level impairment.
- Psychosis: treat frank psychosis separately; do not bootstrap this doctrine to psychotic offenses absent a direct, well‑supported RSB‑to‑psychosis causal chain.

5) What to admit and how to weigh it
- Neurocognitive batteries: useful if validity‑checked and interpreted conservatively; they speak to trait‑level control, not moment‑level time‑stamps.
- Cortisol (salivary/hair): supportive for chronic stress; single‑day salivary profiles are noisy; hair cortisol offers a pre‑offense window but is confounded by hair practices. Never dispositive.
- Historic BLLs, anemia, malnutrition: probative of developmental insult; require linkage to the current executive‑function profile; not moment‑probative by themselves.
- fMRI/EEG: do not admit to prove individual incapacity at time of offense; permit as background mechanism education only if Rule 403 does not risk confusion or undue weight.

6) Jury management and instructions
- Bifurcation: guilt first; if the defense survives gatekeeping, present to the same jury with limiting instructions; or employ a special issues phase immediately after liability on actus/mens rea.
- Special verdict form with focused questions, for example:
  1) Has the defendant proven, by clear and convincing evidence, that at the time of the offense his inhibitory control was substantially degraded such that he lacked a fair opportunity to conform his conduct to law?
  2) If yes, was that degradation substantially caused by cumulative, documented environmental deprivation and associated biological insults?
- Pattern instruction language (plain English):
  “You may consider whether the defendant’s capacity to stop himself in the moment was substantially impaired by long‑standing, documented environmental harms that are known to disrupt brain systems for impulse control. This defense applies only to sudden, reactive violence without planning. It does not apply if the defendant planned the act or if voluntary intoxication was the immediate cause. Scientific tests cannot tell you what happened in the defendant’s mind at the exact second, but you may weigh whether the totality of the evidence makes it highly probable that he had no fair opportunity to comply with the law at that moment.”

7) Disposition if excuse is found
- Noncarceral ESB conditions tailored to the mechanism (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation away from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, job/education pipelines), intensive supervision, and victim‑protective conditions. Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

8) Fallback: structured mitigation
- In cases that fail the excuse but meet substantial parts of Stage 1 (documented cumulative deprivation and a biological insult), channel RSB to sentencing with a validated mitigation grid. That preserves desert and general deterrence while acknowledging “special difficulty” under Hart.

Why this won’t flood the courts
- The combined demands—objective longitudinal deprivation plus at least one developmental biological insult; a pre‑offense dyscontrol record; replicated, validity‑checked neurocognitive deficits in inhibition/affect regulation; a classic reactive event signature; and clean alternative‑cause exclusion—will confine this to a small tail of cases. Most dockets will see few that clear the gate; fewer still will persuade a jury under a clear‑and‑convincing standard.

Finally, a caution consistent with Dr. Chen’s: courts must resist over‑reading any single biomarker or task score. This doctrine should turn on convergence plus a tight fit between mechanism and moment. That keeps faith with the fairness limit without sacrificing administrability or public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Prof. Santiago’s and Dr. Chen’s proposals into a concrete gatekeeping protocol and instruction? Specifically: (1) at a pretrial Daubert-style hearing, what minimum proffer must the defense make (e.g., is pre-offense documentation of dyscontrol a necessary condition) and what disqualifiers should be categorical (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, evidence of planning); and (2) draft a short model jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and listing the limited offense domain and key exclusions, so jurors don’t over-weight post hoc testing.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly in the same place as Dr. Chen on the science and would tighten a few screws for administrability and error‑cost control. None of these measures time‑stamps volitional failure. The only honest path is a convergence requirement, confined to reactive violence, with a clear‑and‑convincing burden and real gatekeeping.

On the tools

- Neurocognitive tasks:
  - Keep: stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with well‑estimated SSRT), antisaccade; add an affect‑laden inhibitory task (emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop) because many incidents are under negative affect.
  - Downweight: generic Stroop and WCST; they lack specificity to motor/affective inhibition.
  - Require: multiple performance‑validity tests; replicate or cross‑validate results to blunt state noise (sleep loss, meds, acute stress).
  - Avoid showy but low‑forensic‑utility modalities (e.g., fMRI) except, if at all, as non‑determinative support.

- Stress/exposure markers:
  - Hair cortisol (3‑month window) is more probative of chronic load than single‑day saliva, but still nonspecific; treat as supportive only.
  - Historic childhood blood‑lead levels are probative of developmental insult if in sensitive windows; again, not moment‑specific but they strengthen plausibility when paired with current inhibitory deficits.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition/FASD documentation is supportive, not specific.

Minimum bundle for clear and convincing proof

I would require the following pillars, all present, with no major disqualifier:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑instantaneous escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized, short‑duration conduct; no luring or staging; contemporaneous corroboration (witnesses, 911/body‑cam/video) of dissociation/“saw red,” autonomic arousal; minimal post‑event concealment.
- If there is evident planning, weapon staging, or instrumental motive, the defense should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol and exposures
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile or ED notes describing dissociation/IED‑like episodes, sleep disruption tied to environment; CPS/police reports of witnessed violence). This answers temporality and reduces “forensic artifact” concerns.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity guardrails
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), with intact effort indices (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs) and either replication or cross‑test convergence; include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) where feasible.
- Low–moderate psychopathy/antisocial trait scores to support an impulsive/reactive (not predatory) profile; treat trait measures cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps the mechanism to the moment
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to the documented exposures and with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index incident. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult or extraordinary trauma load
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL on repeated measures or a ≥10 µg/dL peak; verified early malnutrition/IDA; credible FASD risk), or, alternatively, an unusually high, corroborated trauma load (substantiated abuse/neglect, caregiver incarceration, witnessed homicide) with onset and duration consistent with the observed deficits.

And all of these disqualifiers absent:
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver.
- Malingering/secondary gain indicators (failed PVTs, “too bad to be true” scatter, selective impairments inconsistent with known patterns).
- Primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI as the better explanation (unless one is proceeding under a different doctrine).
- Clear instrumental motive/advance planning.

Scientific pitfalls courts should be alert to

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and the stress of arrest/incarceration can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing, repeat where feasible, and lean on pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑charge testing and newly minted narratives are less weighty than pre‑charge documentation.
- Base‑rate neglect and neuro‑charm: inhibitory deficits and flattened cortisol are common in stressed populations; don’t over‑read them without event‑level alignment.
- Measure validity and lab quality: ensure known error rates, normative appropriateness, and quality control; require disclosure of raw data for independent review.
- Substance effects: voluntary intoxication commonly degrades inhibition; as a rule, that should defeat a dyscontrol excuse.

Procedural/administrative guardrails

- Pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; production of raw data.
- Notice and standardized templates for records (medical labs, CPS/school, housing/EPA, unemployment, geocoded residence history).
- Confine the doctrine to genuinely reactive violent offenses; do not extend to planned acquisitive crime.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions to minimize neuro‑charm and keep the jury focused on Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply.

With this package—event signature, pre‑offense history, valid inhibitory deficits, a diagnosis that maps to the moment, and at least one objective developmental insult (plus no disqualifiers)—you will see very few cases pass the gate. That is appropriate. It preserves public legitimacy, protects victims by reserving full condemnation for those with a fair shot, and keeps the law’s administrability intact.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution bundle as the scientific substrate, can you translate this into concrete courtroom mechanics? Specifically: (i) what should a pretrial Daubert/Rule 104(a) gatekeeping order require (burden, offense eligibility, neutral experts, required documents/tests, exclusion factors, and a 403 balancing template); and (ii) what core jury instruction would you give if the defense passes the gate—define “substantial impairment of inhibitory control,” clarify that biomarkers are supportive not dispositive, set the clear‑and‑convincing standard, and limit the excuse to reactive violence. Please be precise in proposed language so we can assess administrability and error costs.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Big picture. None of these instruments time‑stamps loss of control. If we are to use a dyscontrol excuse at guilt, event‑level facts must do most of the work; labs and tests can only corroborate mechanism and trait vulnerability. I would treat neurocognitive and stress markers as supportive, never determinative, and require tight convergence before a jury may infer “no fair opportunity to comply” at the moment of offense.

Gatekeeping posture. Pretrial Daubert/Kumho hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts; standardized proffers; disclosure of raw data; performance‑validity testing; and funding parity for indigent defendants. Limit the doctrine to reactive interpersonal violence and carve out planned acquisitive crime.

On the proposed tools

- Neurocognitive batteries
  - Useful: Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go (with reliable SSRT), antisaccade, flanker, and an affective inhibition task (emotional Go‑No‑Go/affective Stroop). These assay inhibition under affective load; still state‑sensitive.
  - Mixed: Classic Stroop and WCST are broad executive probes; I would down‑weight WCST for lack of specificity to inhibition.
  - Require multiple stand‑alone and embedded validity measures, and either replication over sessions or cross‑test convergence.
  - Add a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) as ancillary.
  - Use trait psychopathy (e.g., PCL‑R) cautiously; it is not a dyscontrol test and carries bias risks. At most, low–moderate trait scores are consistent with an impulsive (not predatory) profile.

- Stress/exposure markers
  - Historic blood lead (childhood BLLs) is probative of developmental insult if elevated during sensitive windows; it strengthens a causal story but cannot speak to the moment.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition records and prenatal alcohol exposure are supportive.
  - Cortisol: single‑day salivary profiles are noisy; hair cortisol provides a 2–3 month window and is preferable for chronic load. Treat as corroborative only.
  - HRV/threat‑startle can support an affect‑regulation mechanism but are not specific.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)

All of the following must be present, with no single element sufficient:

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation after a salient provocation; seconds–minutes latency; disorganized execution; absence of advance planning or concealment; contemporaneous witnesses/body‑cam/911 audio describing “blanking out,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal. If there was luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental behavior, the excuse should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School/juvenile/medical records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound outbursts, dissociation, or explosive reactivity (e.g., IEPs, ED visits, prior diagnoses), and sleep disruption consistent with chronic environmental stress.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT elevation, antisaccade errors, affective Go‑No‑Go), intact effort across multiple PVTs, and stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom pattern plausibly explains the index behavior (triggers, dissociation), anchored to documented exposures. Biological stress indices may corroborate but are not required.

5) Objective developmental insult
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a prior ≥10; documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency; credible FASD risk), temporally preceding and plausibly related to current executive deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls satisfied:

- Voluntary intoxication not the proximate driver. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication. As a rule, voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse.
- No primary psychosis/mania as the immediate cause (unless proceeding under an insanity framework).
- Malingering safeguards satisfied (multiple PVTs; collateral informants; consistency over time).
- Timing safeguards: testing conducted promptly (ideally within 30–60 days) with replication or corroboration; heavy weight on pre‑charge records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Scientific pitfalls and how courts should manage them

- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss, meds, legal stress depress test performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; repeat or corroborate; consider actigraphy or collateral sleep evidence.
- Reverse causation. Post‑arrest stress can alter biomarkers and cognition. Prefer pre‑offense documentation; use hair cortisol to capture pre‑offense windows.
- Multiple comparisons/adversarial allegiance. Pre‑specify the test battery; require disclosure of all administered measures; consider blinded scoring or neutral experts.
- Ecological fallacy. Neighborhood‑level deprivation is not individual attribution. The Stage‑1 history opens the gate; Stage‑2 evidence must be individual and proximate.
- Expert shopping/culture shopping. Use neutral, court‑appointed experts; require notice and standardized documentary proofs; cap expert numbers absent good cause.
- Over‑interpretation of imaging. Routine fMRI/EEG lacks individual‑level forensic validity for volitional control; admit only, if at all, as low‑weight corroboration under strict Daubert scrutiny.

Do these tools, so deployed, suffice? In a narrow slice of cases, yes—when event facts, pre‑offense history, inhibition deficits with valid effort, and a documented biological insult align, and alternative proximate causes are excluded. Where that convergence is missing, the same evidence belongs at sentencing, not at guilt.

Finally, doctrinal fit. I would reserve this demanding bundle for a complete excuse in “involuntary‑rage automatism” cases. A somewhat lower showing—centered on event‑level reactivity and “person in the actor’s situation” evidence—should inform MPC‑style Extreme Emotional Disturbance in homicide. Everything else goes to structured mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators. That allocation respects Hart’s fairness limit, protects public legitimacy, and keeps the floodgates shut.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming we adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, what is your concrete gatekeeping blueprint to keep this administrable and defensible on appeal? Please sketch: (a) a pretrial Daubert‑style checklist of findings the judge must make before the jury hears any RSB‑dyscontrol evidence; (b) a model limiting instruction that defines “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and confines the excuse to reactive violence; and (c) categorical exclusions (e.g., voluntary intoxication, instrumental/planned crimes, use of fMRI as sole proof). Aim for rule‑like language a trial court could drop into an order.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen’s bottom line is exactly right: no single test or biomarker tells you “control was off” at the instant, and courts should demand convergence across mechanism, history, and moment. From an administrability and evidence‑law vantage, I would tighten Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 to a small, specified bundle, and I would prune tools with poor specificity.

What I would admit and how I would use it

- Event‑level signature (indispensable)
  - Near‑immediate, affective escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/bodycam/witness descriptions of “blanking out,” shaking, tachycardia).
  - If planning/cover‑up appears, the dyscontrol excuse should presumptively fail.

- Pre‑offense documentation (indispensable)
  - Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline, juvenile MH notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits, sleep disruption). This guards against reverse causation and “forensic artifact.”

- Neurocognitive battery (use a lean, inhibition‑focused set, with validity checks)
  - Require deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks: Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (SSRT), antisaccade, and an affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop. Include delay discounting as supportive.
  - Include multiple performance‑validity tests; repeat or corroborate across sessions to mitigate state noise. Downweight WCST (set‑shifting) and use classic Stroop only as ancillary.
  - Trait psychopathy evidence (e.g., PCL‑R) is contentious and prejudicial; if used, keep it limited and explanatory (impulsive vs predatory), not dispositive.

- Psychiatric/physiological linkage (anchored to Stage 1 exposures)
  - A structured DSM‑5 diagnosis tied to documented exposures (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) with symptom content that plausibly maps onto the index trigger. Biological stress corroboration (hair cortisol/flattened diurnal slope) may support but should not be required.

- Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism (supportive, but I would require at least one)
  - Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or a ≥10 event) during sensitive windows; or documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; or well‑substantiated FASD risk. These are not time‑stamps; they supply plausibility for enduring prefrontal control deficits.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing

Require all five:
1) Reactive event signature (as above).
2) Pre‑offense dyscontrol documentation.
3) Two convergent inhibitory control deficits with intact validity indices.
4) Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis plausibly mapping to the event.
5) At least one verified developmental biological insult consistent with the mechanism.

And require all disqualifiers be cleared:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI, malingering (multiple PVTs), and clear instrumental motive.
- Testing completed promptly (ideally within 30–60 days) and cross‑checked against pre‑charge records.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds: sleep loss, meds, acute legal stress depress performance and cortisol; standardize testing conditions and, where possible, repeat.
- Malingering/secondary gain: embed multiple validity measures; distrust “too bad to be true” patterns or selective failures.
- Acute intoxication: do not let chronic “toxin history” bootstrap acute substance effects into excuse.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and impair testing; pre‑offense records are the antidote.
- Over‑reading glamor science: fMRI/EEG should be treated, at most, as educational context; rarely probative under Rule 403/702.

Procedural guardrails

- Daubert/Rule 702 pretrial hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the checklist above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Strict notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, school/CPS, housing/EPA, geocoded histories).
- Offense domain restriction: reactive violent offenses; exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions to preserve jury focus: if the gate is passed, the jury is asked a single, tight question—did the defendant’s capacity to inhibit a reactive assault, at the moment, fall so far below the fair‑opportunity line, due to the proven exposures, that punishment is unwarranted?

This keeps the doctrine in the narrow lane I can endorse: an involuntary‑rage/dyscontrol excuse for a small subset of reactive violence, grounded in pre‑existing records and inhibition‑specific testing, not post hoc narratives or broad social causation. For everything else, use MPC‑style EED in homicide and structured mitigation at sentencing keyed to verified deprivation and exposure.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming the court adopts Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage eligibility/attribution gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence with disqualifiers, what concrete jury instruction language would you propose? Please draft succinct model text that defines: (a) “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense”; (b) the causal nexus (“a substantial contributing cause”); and (c) an explicit voluntary‑intoxication bar. Note the burden and standard you recommend and whether you would bifurcate. Aim for one paragraph per element.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Short answer: no single assay can “time‑stamp” loss of control; the science supports only probabilistic attribution. But a narrowly cabined, convergent bundle—tied to an event signature of reactive violence, pre‑offense documentation, valid inhibition deficits, and at least one objective developmental insult—can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in rare cases. The court’s job is fit and discipline: admit only what reliably bears on inhibitory control at the moment, exclude what is flashy but nonspecific, and police alternative causes.

What is sufficiently specific and temporally probative
- Individually: SSRT/Go–No‑Go, Stroop, WCST, cortisol, and historic BLLs are not temporally precise and are not specific standing alone.
- As a bundle: they can support “substantial volitional impairment at the time” if and only if they converge with (a) a reactive event pattern and (b) pre‑offense records showing the same dyscontrol phenotype.

Minimum convergence I would require (all five; clear and convincing)
1) Event signature
- Rapid escalation after salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/preparation/cover‑up; contemporaneous accounts of “seeing red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal. Video/911/body‑cam if available.
2) Pre‑offense history (nonforensic)
- School/juvenile/medical records, before the index offense, documenting stimulus‑bound rages, dissociation, or impulse‑control problems; not merely bad behavior but episodes of loss of control.
3) Neurocognitive testing with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade or affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Down‑weight WCST; it is nonspecific. Include a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available. Low–moderate PCL‑R (or equivalent) to support a reactive, not predatory, profile.
4) Clinical linkage that maps to the event
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented adversities and explaining the trigger/phenomenology of the index act. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not essential.
5) Objective developmental insult
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one biologically plausible insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or one ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), and a plausible link between dose/timing and current inhibition deficits.

Disqualifiers/controls the court should police
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute effects.
- Planning/instrumentality: weapon staging, luring, concealment, or clear goal‑directed motives presumptively defeat.
- Alternative causes: primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, or malingering (addressed through multiple PVTs, cross‑source consistency).
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine), prefer early testing (30–60 days) with retest or collateral corroboration, and lean heavily on pre‑offense records to mitigate reverse causation (post‑charge stress effects).

Daubert/fit guidance
- Admit: SSRT/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective interference tasks, well‑validated PTSD/IED instruments, historic BLLs, pediatric lab records; hair cortisol as supportive (note known limitations), HRV similarly supportive. Require reported error rates, standard protocols, and peer‑reviewed support.
- Be wary/limit: WCST (nonspecific), conventional Stroop standing alone, glossy fMRI images (Rule 403 risk of undue weight). Treat neuroimaging, if offered, as demonstrative/contextual at best.
- Require “fit”: the expert must explain how each measure bears on inhibitory control in the instant event, not merely on general risk or character.

Procedural guardrails (to keep the gate tight and even‑handed)
- Pretrial Daubert hearing tied to the five‑pillar template; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Standardized proffer forms for records (school/CPS/medical/EPA‑HUD/UI, geocoded histories).
- Limit offense domain to reactive interpersonal violence (and, in homicide, offer MPC‑style EED as a fallback). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcation/special interrogatory: preserve jury focus by trying liability in the usual way, then, if needed, submit a special question: “Has the defendant proved by clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the act, inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause?” Provide a tailored instruction that these measures are probabilistic, not character evidence.

Jury instruction (core elements)
- “You may consider scientific and historical evidence only if you find it reliably shows (1) a longstanding pattern of adversity capable of degrading inhibitory control, (2) objective deficits in inhibition measured with valid tests, and (3) that the index act bore the stamp of a reactive, unplanned loss of control. Mere exposure to adversity, general impulsivity, or later‑acquired test results are insufficient. You must exclude voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause.”

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 architecture, as refined by Dr. Chen, is the right spine. With the five‑pillar minimum and the listed disqualifiers, the doctrine will remain narrow—reserved for the top tail of cumulative adversity where mechanism, history, and moment align. Outside that narrow band, the proper home for RSB is MPC‑style EED (in homicide) and structured mitigation at sentencing, coupled with ESB‑oriented, victim‑protective dispositions.

---

### Speaker: Host

Putting your judge hat on: if a jurisdiction were to adopt a narrow RSB–dyscontrol excuse along the lines Dr. Chen described, what would your model jury instruction look like? Please draft concise instruction language that (i) states the defendant’s clear‑and‑convincing burden; (ii) enumerates the core elements (reactive event signature; pre‑offense history; valid neurocognitive deficits; clinical linkage; objective exposure marker); (iii) lists categorical exclusions (substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver; malingering; instrumental/planned conduct); and (iv) limits the excuse to reactive violence. Include any cautionary notes you would give jurors about how to weigh neuroscientific and biomarker evidence vis‑à‑vis the moment of offense.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery here. I agree with Dr. Chen’s central caution: none of these instruments time‑stamps loss of control. In court they are corroborative, not dispositive. If we are to admit a dyscontrol excuse at guilt at all, it should be confined to the involuntary‑rage/automatism corner and only on a convergent showing, under a clear‑and‑convincing burden, that (i) the index act bore the signature of reactive dyscontrol and (ii) the defendant had pre‑existing, well‑documented inhibitory deficits plausibly traceable to severe deprivation or biological insults.

What is probative and what is not
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go (with valid SSRT) and antisaccade are the most on‑point; an affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop variant adds value because many incidents are affect‑laden. WCST is weakly specific; downweight it. All testing must include multiple performance‑validity indices and standardized administration; consider re‑testing to address state noise.
- Stress/exposure markers: childhood blood lead (particularly repeated BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, and any ≥10 µg/dL) and documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency are probative of developmental insult when paired with current executive deficits. Hair/diurnal cortisol can support a chronic stress picture but are nonspecific and sensitive to confounds (hair treatments, sleep, acute jail stress); treat them as supportive only.
- Psychiatric linkage: a structured, clinician‑established diagnosis (e.g., PTSD with dissociation, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored in pre‑offense records is relevant when the symptom pattern maps the index trigger and phenomenology.
- Glitzy neuroimaging (fMRI/EEG) should rarely be admitted; it lacks individual‑level diagnostic specificity and carries undue prejudice.

Minimum bundle I would require (all five; no single element suffices)
1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; minimal planning; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions of “seeing red/blanking out,” autonomic arousal; ideally corroborated by video/911/body‑cam. Any luring, weapon staging, concealment, or other instrumental behavior should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the crime (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, prior ED or clinic notes of dissociation/IED, juvenile files) showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control. This addresses temporality and the “forensic artifact” problem.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairments on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT slowing, antisaccade error rate, affective interference), with intact effort measures and cross‑test convergence. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available. Low–moderate psychopathic traits support an impulsive, not predatory, profile.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that explains this event
- A structured diagnosis consistent with the exposure history and the index trigger; biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent documentation of at least one biological insult (lead, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, FASD risk) during sensitive windows, predating and plausibly contributing to current executive deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse; showing baseline dyscontrol does not rescue it.
- Malingering: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; consistency across sessions; collateral informants.
- Alternative primary drivers excluded: frank psychosis or mania unrelated to the RSB exposures; acute TBI at the time; clear instrumental motive.
- Timing: testing early (ideally within 30–60 days) and reliance on pre‑charge records to avoid reverse causation from incarceration stress.
- Base‑rate/selection concerns: ensure equal expert resources for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will skew.

Judicial guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Offense restriction: limit the excuse to truly reactive violent offenses; channel most other cases to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (homicide only) or to sentencing mitigation.
- Jury instruction: emphasize that post‑charge tests are corroborative only; the question is whether inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the moment and whether that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act, not whether the defendant had a hard life.
- Disposition: if the excuse is found, use ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused treatment, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports), with civil commitment available only upon the ordinary mental‑illness/dangerousness showing.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds (sleep loss, meds, pain, acute stress) depressing test scores; mitigate by standardization and re‑testing.
- Reverse causation (jail stress flattening cortisol; litigation effects on performance).
- Cultural/test norm issues (hair cortisol in different hair types; test norms not representative); require appropriate norms and expert explanation.
- Over‑interpretation of any single biomarker and undue persuasive effect of colorful brain images.

Bottom line: with these constraints, the Stage 2 bundle can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a narrow band of cases. Beyond that band, I would preserve culpability determinations for the jury using existing doctrines—MPC EED in homicide—and address RSB through structured mitigation at sentencing. This preserves fairness to victims and public legitimacy while honoring Hart’s fairness limit on punishment.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability standpoint, if you were drafting a model rule for an RSB–dyscontrol excuse, what would the black‑letter elements and gatekeeping architecture look like? Please specify: (i) the elements the jury must find (and the burden/standard), keyed to “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense”; (ii) the pretrial Daubert‑style screening you’d mandate (including neutral experts and what kinds of evidence are in/ out); (iii) any categorical offense limits (e.g., reactive violence only, intoxication bar); and (iv) the verdict form/bifurcation you’d use to preserve jury focus and public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Two touchstones should govern Stage 2: (1) administrability under evidentiary rules; and (2) a genuinely convergent showing that impaired inhibition, not ordinary anger or opportunism, substantially caused the act. I largely agree with Dr. Chen’s science cautions. From a trial bench perspective, here is what I would require and how I would guard against overclaiming.

A. What the tests can and cannot do
- No single instrument is temporally precise enough to prove momentary loss of control. They are supportive when they cohere with the event signature and pre‑offense documentation.
- Useful tasks: stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with valid SSRT), antisaccade, and an affective inhibition task (emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop). WCST adds little to the mechanism at issue; I would downweight it.
- Biomarkers: historic childhood BLLs (especially repeated ≥5 µg/dL or any ≥10 µg/dL) and other developmental insults (IDA/malnutrition, well‑documented FASD risk) strengthen causal plausibility; hair/diurnal cortisol can corroborate chronic stress but are nonspecific and should never be dispositive.

B. Minimum converging bundle (clear and convincing) — all pillars plus disqualifiers
1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Acute provocation followed by near‑immediate escalation; disorganized execution; absence of luring/preparation/cover‑up.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (witness statements, 911/body‑cam/video) of “blanking out,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (nonforensic)
- School/juvenile/medical records predating the offense that show stimulus‑bound explosive episodes, dissociation, or IED‑like presentations; sleep disruption records if relevant.
- This addresses temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation (i.e., testing artifacts from post‑charge stress).

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity and cross‑task convergence
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and antisaccade, or SSRT and affective Go–No‑Go) with intact performance validity (multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs), and stability across sessions or corroboration by independent testing.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive, not predatory, aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R; used cautiously).

4) Clinical diagnosis mapped to the index event
- Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom content (triggers, dissociation) that plausibly explains the index event; ideally some pre‑offense clinical or school corroboration.

5) At least one objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Documented childhood lead exposure, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or well‑supported prenatal alcohol/drug exposure (independent of litigation), which plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/alternative‑cause controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; if substances were present, defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, strong instrumental motive, or evidence of planning negate the claim.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, consistency across time, collateral informant reports; be alert to “too bad to be true” patterns.

C. Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, and acute legal stress can depress executive scores and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer replication or pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation and forensic artifact: heavy reliance on post‑charge testing invites over‑interpretation; hair cortisol (pre‑offense segment) helps but is not decisive.
- “Brain overclaim” risk: fMRI/EEG should be treated, at most, as supportive demonstratives; exclude if methodology or inference does not meet Daubert/Rule 702.
- Norms and equity: ensure appropriate demographic norms for neurocognitive tests; avoid pathologizing poverty per se.
- PCL‑R misuse: do not transmute modest scores into exculpation or aggravation; use only to distinguish impulsive vs predatory patterns.

D. Procedural guardrails (administrability and fairness)
- Pretrial gatekeeping: Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer tied to the five pillars; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden at the gate. If the showing fails, the evidence may still be admissible at sentencing (and, in homicide, for MPC EED).
- Neutral experts: court‑appointed neuropsychologist, psychiatrist, and environmental health expert to review raw data and exposure records; parity funding for indigent defendants.
- Offense limitation: confine the excuse to reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcation and instructions: where the gate is met, use specialized instructions that (i) define “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” (more than difficulty, less than total unconsciousness); (ii) require that impairment be a substantial contributing cause of the act; and (iii) direct jurors to disregard voluntary intoxication and to distinguish reactive from instrumental aggression.

Sample instruction kernel (for the record)
- “The defendant asserts an excuse of reactive dyscontrol. To prevail, the defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the act, his/her capacity to inhibit an immediate, affect‑driven response was substantially impaired due to documented developmental and stress‑related factors, and that this impairment was a substantial contributing cause of the conduct. Mere anger, moral outrage, or ordinary difficulty in self‑control is insufficient. If you find the State has proven planning or instrumental purpose, or that voluntary intoxication was the proximate cause, you must reject this excuse.”

E. Disposition
- If the excuse is found: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions with risk management (trauma‑focused therapy, stable housing away from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports), and civil commitment only if ongoing dangerousness is proven under standard commitment criteria.
- If the excuse fails: channel the same record to MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or structured mitigation at sentencing keyed to verified deprivation indicators.

Bottom line
The combination Dr. Chen outlines—event‑signature, pre‑offense documentation, valid inhibition deficits, a mapped diagnosis, and an objective developmental insult, with strict exclusions—can reach a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a small subset of cases. Anything less slides from Hart’s “no fair opportunity to comply” into general sympathy. The proposed bundle, implemented through tight gatekeeping and neutral expertise, keeps the doctrine morally honest and institutionally governable.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming a narrow RSB–dyscontrol excuse of the sort Santiago and Chen outlined, could you draft a concise model jury instruction that (i) places a clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defendant, (ii) defines “reactive dyscontrol” at the time of offense, (iii) expressly excludes voluntary intoxication and planned/instrumental aggression, (iv) requires converging evidence (pre‑offense history, valid neurocognitive deficits, documented exposures), and (v) guides jurors on weighing conflicting experts without turning disagreement alone into reasonable doubt? Please give the instruction text and note any brief commentary on how you’d deliver it to preserve focus and legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I largely agree with Dr. Chen’s scientific cautions and with Prof. Santiago’s basic architecture: Stage 2 must be about the moment, not just the milieu. But from an administrability and error‑cost perspective, the bundle must be tight, replicable, and centered on evidence courts handle well. Neurocognitive and biomarker data can corroborate; they cannot carry the causal load alone.

What I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard

Confine applicability: reactive violent offenses only (affective, rapidly unfolding), presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes. Defense must prove all of A–C, plus no disqualifiers.

A. Event‑level signature (must have all)
- Immediacy/disorganization: a salient provocation followed within seconds/minutes by the act; no luring, staging, or concealment. Corroboration by video/911/body‑cam or multiple witnesses.
- Phenomenology of dyscontrol: contemporaneous descriptions of “blanking out/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal; brief post‑event confusion/dissociation. Mere after‑the‑fact amnesia is insufficient.
- Intoxication screen: no substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (toxicology and lay observations). If substances present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; as a rule, voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse.

B. Pre‑offense foundation (must have both)
- Documented history of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol predating the offense from nonforensic sources (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile MH notes of dissociation/Intermittent Explosive Disorder; ED visits for rage episodes; sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation.
- At least one verified developmental biological insult consistent with impaired inhibitory control: childhood BLL ≥10 µg/dL at any point or repeated ≥5 µg/dL; or confirmed FASD risk (medical/CPS); or documented early malnutrition with iron‑deficiency anemia. These must predate the offense and be independently recorded.

C. Post‑charge clinical/neurocognitive corroboration (must have all)
- Psychiatric diagnosis that maps to the event: PTSD (dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder established by a qualified clinician using structured instruments, with identified triggers plausibly linked to the index offense; not a litigation‑only diagnosis.
- Neurocognitive deficits with validity: testing within 45–60 days (and, if feasible, a brief re‑test), with multiple performance‑validity tests. Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks directly tied to the mechanism (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go or antisaccade, plus an affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop). WCST alone is too nonspecific and should not be relied upon. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available.
- Trait profile consistent with reactive rather than predatory aggression (low–moderate psychopathic traits, used cautiously).

Disqualifiers/controls
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at offense; strong instrumental motive; malingering (failed validity testing). Any of these should defeat the excuse.
- Acute incarceration effects: courts should give little weight to cortisol or other stress markers obtained after detention unless anchored to a pre‑offense window (e.g., hair cortisol segment).

What I would admit only as supportive
- Hair cortisol/HRV: may support chronic stress but lack specificity; never dispositive.
- fMRI/EEG: too noisy for liability; at most demonstrative, not proof.
- “Sibling controls” and complex causal modeling: probative in research, impractical for trials; do not make them prerequisites.

Judicial gatekeeping and process
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to the elements above; require a structured proffer with documentary exhibits (medical labs, CPS/school, housing/EPA, geocoded residence history).
- Appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology and psychiatry; ensure funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds, substances) and require repeat or cross‑test convergence where practicable.
- Jury instruction should track an automatism‑adjacent standard: the defense must prove that, at the time of the act, the defendant experienced a transient state of reactive dyscontrol that functionally negated conscious inhibitory control, and that this state was substantially caused by documented developmental exposures, not by voluntary intoxication or calculated purpose.

Key pitfalls courts should watch
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, legal stress can depress performance. Prefer pre‑offense records; weigh post‑charge testing cautiously unless replicated.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity measures; be skeptical of selective “too bad” profiles.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: Stage 1 exposures explain risk; Stage 2 must show this defendant’s control was degraded at this moment.
- Overreliance on nonspecific tasks (e.g., WCST) and overinterpretation of biomarkers (cortisol, neuroimaging).

Disposition
If the excuse is found, route to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma therapy, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines), with civil commitment available only if the person is dangerous and mentally ill. If the showing falls short, consider MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 list is broadly sound if we discipline it to (1) a strong event signature, (2) pre‑offense documentation, and (3) valid inhibition‑focused testing, and if we relegate noisy biomarkers to a supporting role. That keeps faith with Hart’s “fair opportunity” limit while preserving administrability and public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle and her disqualifiers into an administrable courtroom protocol? Specifically: (i) what should a Daubert‑style pretrial proffer require, document‑by‑document, before the jury ever hears RSB‑dyscontrol evidence; (ii) would you mandate court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health) and in what sequence relative to party experts; and (iii) what would a model jury instruction—using a clear‑and‑convincing standard—say to ensure the finding is about substantial loss of inhibitory control at the moment of offense (and not mere correlation or trait impulsivity), while minimizing Type I errors and resource‑driven disparities?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

The right way to think about Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is Hart’s fairness limit operationalized: did this defendant, at this moment, lack a fair opportunity to conform? The science cannot time‑stamp volition to the second, but it can, with discipline, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference when mechanism, history, and event line up. I would adopt a narrow, rule‑governed screen built around four showings, with tight gatekeeping and fallback channels to EED and sentencing if the excuse fails.

1) Gatekeeping and burden
- Affirmative defense; 45–60 day notice with a structured proffer.
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing; court may appoint neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Defendant bears clear‑and‑convincing burden on each element below.
- Offense limitation: reactive violent offenses (and truly impulsive nonviolent episodes, rarely). A rebuttable presumption of ineligibility where there is planning, luring, weapon staging, concealment, or instrumental motive.
- Voluntary intoxication bars the excuse unless defendant proves baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication and that intoxication was not the proximate driver.

2) Required Stage 2 showings (minimum bundle)
A. Event signature (proximate, reactive dyscontrol)
- Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions of “seeing red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal; post‑event confusion. Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/bodycam, witness accounts).
- Disqualifiers: evidence of planning, goal‑directed steps, or post‑offense instrumental conduct.

B. Pre‑offense pattern (temporality)
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge documentation of stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile or medical notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption). This mitigates reverse causation from incarceration stress or litigation artifacts.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks closely tied to the mechanism (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), administered within 60–90 days, with multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and, ideally, stability across sessions.
- Include a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) and a low‑to‑moderate trait psychopathy profile (used cautiously) to support impulsive rather than predatory aggression.
- Downweight set‑shifting (WCST) except as supportive.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage (mechanistic plausibility)
- A structured‑interview diagnosis consistent with the index event (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented exposures; symptom timing and triggers must plausibly map onto the offense.
- Supportive, not determinative, physiology: hair/diurnal cortisol profiles indicative of chronic stress; historic blood lead levels (BLLs) from childhood; records of iron‑deficiency/malnutrition. Admit fMRI/EEG, if at all, only as background science (Rule 403 concerns).

E. Alternative cause exclusion
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, malingering (multiple PVTs, cross‑source consistency), and substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause.

3) Scientific pitfalls and how courts should manage them
- State–trait confounds: Standardize testing (sleep, caffeine, meds), consider actigraphy/sleep logs, and rely on pre‑offense records to avoid mistaking transient states for traits.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use batteries with embedded and stand‑alone validity indices; be wary of selective or “too bad to be true” impairment.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary use generally defeats the excuse. Distinguish developmental toxin history (lead, FASD) from acute substance effects.
- Reverse causation: Post‑offense incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance; hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and historic pediatric/education/CPS/EPA records are more probative.
- Over‑interpretation: No single biomarker proves momentary loss of control; require convergence across the bundle.

4) Jury management and findings
- Bifurcation: guilt first; if guilty, proceed to RSB excuse phase before sentencing. Alternatively, in homicide, allow the same evidence to be considered for MPC‑style EED if the excuse fails.
- Special instructions (plain language):
  - You must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that (1) the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an impulsive act was substantially degraded, and (2) that degradation was a substantial factor causing the instant act. This is an excuse, not a justification; if proved, it means the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply at that moment.
  - Evidence of hard circumstances, without substantial impairment and causal connection at the time of the offense, is not enough.
  - Voluntary intoxication cannot by itself establish this excuse.
- Special verdict form with interrogatories tracking A–E above to preserve appellate review.

5) Disposition if excuse is established
- Acquittal by reason of dyscontrol, followed immediately by a separate civil‑type dangerousness hearing (clear and convincing) with calibrated, ESB‑oriented conditions: trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines, and no‑contact orders. Civil commitment only if mental illness and dangerousness are proven; periodic judicial review. Ensure victims’ participation and safety planning.

6) Fallback channels to avoid all‑or‑nothing error
- If the excuse is not proven, the same record can support:
  - MPC §210.3 extreme emotional disturbance in homicide; and/or
  - Structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators (e.g., ADI exposure, ACEs, childhood BLLs), with articulated variance ranges.

Why this stays narrow
- Requiring convergence across event signature, pre‑offense pattern, valid inhibition deficits, a diagnosis mapping to the index event, an objective developmental insult, and exclusion of alternatives will confine success to a small subset of reactive cases at the top tail of cumulative adversity. This answers floodgates and legitimacy concerns while honoring Hart’s fairness limit.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming we adopt Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence, would you accept that bundle as meeting a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in principle, and if so, what precise jury instruction would you draft to capture: (i) “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” at the time of the offense; (ii) the causation requirement (that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act); and (iii) explicit exclusions (planning/instrumentality, and voluntary intoxication)? Please propose concrete instruction language and, if you think it helpful, a special verdict form to minimize juror confusion.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I largely agree with Prof. Santiago’s architecture and Dr. Chen’s cautions. None of these tools time‑stamps loss of control; the only honest route is convergence. If we are to recognize a dyscontrol excuse without losing our footing, Stage 2 must be tighter still, with pre‑specified elements, neutral experts, and a narrow offense domain.

1) Specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) are the best of an imperfect lot for inhibitory control. They are state‑sensitive, modest in effect size, and not specific to “legal” dyscontrol. They can support—but not establish—substantial impairment.
- WCST adds little to the mechanism of interest; if used, it should be tertiary.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) index chronic load; childhood BLLs and documented iron deficiency/malnutrition index developmental insult. Useful for plausibility and dose–response; none show momentary incapacity.
- fMRI should be treated, at most, as demonstrative science; in court it risks what Morse called “brain overclaim syndrome.” I would not admit it as proof of impairment.

2) Minimum bundle for a clear‑and‑convincing showing
Make three “core” elements mandatory, plus at least two “technical” pillars. All must be supported by independent, pre‑offense documentation where applicable.

Core (all three required)
- Event signature: Affective/reactive offense with immediacy after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam/witness) of dissociation or autonomic arousal. If there is planning or instrumental post‑event behavior, the defense should presumptively fail.
- Pre‑offense history: Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school discipline/IEPs for explosive behavior; juvenile clinician notes of dissociation/IED; ED visits tied to rage episodes; chronic sleep disruption), establishing temporality.
- Alternative‑cause exclusion: Toxicology excluding substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; no primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI explanation; multiple performance‑validity tests to address malingering.

Technical pillars (at least two of the following three)
- Neurocognitive deficit: ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go), with intact effort indices and either test‑retest stability or cross‑test convergence; trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.
- Psychiatric/physiological linkage: Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented exposures; symptom content maps plausibly onto the index event; supportive chronic‑stress physiology (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) if available.
- Developmental biological insult: Independent records of childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (repeat or one ≥10), iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition, or FASD‑consistent prenatal exposure, coupled with a plausible link to current executive deficits.

3) Procedural guardrails (administrability and equality)
- Daubert/Rule 702 hearing with structured proffer tied to the elements above. Require reporting of test–retest reliability, error rates, and demographically appropriate norms; CLIA‑certified labs for biological assays; clear SSRT computation methods; hair cortisol lab QA/QC and disclosure of confounds (treatments, ethnicity).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); equal funding for indigent defendants or the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.
- Standardized proof templates (school/CPS/medical/EPA‑HUD/UI/geocoded histories); chain‑of‑custody for historic lab values.
- Offense domain: confine to reactive interpersonal violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime and cases with meaningful preparation.

4) Pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and litigation stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; favor pre‑offense records; consider actigraphy or collateral sleep documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; watch for selective, “too bad to be true” impairment; require cross‑source consistency.
- Acute intoxication: Voluntary intoxication should defeat the excuse absent compelling evidence of baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑charge incarceration stress can mimic chronic profiles; hair cortisol can anchor a pre‑offense window; weight pre‑charge documentation heavily.
- Ecological fallacy/base rates: High‑deprivation backgrounds are common in dockets; the defense must be about this defendant’s impaired control at this moment, not population correlations.

5) Jury instruction and burden
- Bifurcate. Place a clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense to prove that, at the time of the offense, inhibitory control was substantially degraded by documented RSB‑linked mechanisms such that the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform. Emphasize that poverty alone, anger, or bad character is not enough; nor are general executive weaknesses without an event‑level reactive signature.

6) Disposition
- If established, treat as an excuse akin to tightly circumscribed “involuntary‑rage” automatism: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, safe housing, sleep/nutrition interventions, employment supports), with civil commitment available only on the usual standards if the person remains demonstrably dangerous.
- For those who miss this gate but present severe deprivation with situational triggering, route to mitigation (and, in homicide, to MPC‑style EED), not to acquittal.

This calibration keeps faith with Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply—while respecting institutional constraints. It narrows error costs by making event‑level reactivity and pre‑offense documentation indispensable, and it avoids turning generalized social disadvantage into a freestanding defense.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming we adopt a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the Santiago/Chen five‑pillar convergence (event signature, pre‑offense history, validated neurocog deficits, psychiatric linkage, and an objective developmental exposure), how would you implement this administrably? Please propose a concrete framework: (i) pretrial gate (burden, Daubert hearing, neutral experts); and (ii) a model jury instruction that captures the standard and key disqualifiers (planning, voluntary intoxication, malingering), while preserving the presumption of innocence. Keep it tight enough to manage error costs and public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly in line with Dr. Chen’s scientific cautions and with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate. For a court, the touchstones must be (i) a fair‑opportunity framework (Hart) tied to (ii) administrable, pre‑specified criteria that avoid “neuro-mystique,” and (iii) clear separation between population risk and case‑level attribution. None of the proposed measures is time‑stamped enough to prove second‑by‑second loss of control; the only safe course is convergence across independent domains plus strong event‑level phenomenology. Here’s how I would tighten Stage 2 for courtroom use.

1) What is sufficiently probative at attribution (Stage 2)
- Event phenotype (must have)
  - Rapid, affective escalation in direct response to a salient provocation; no luring/weapon staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous indicators (bodycam/911/witness accounts of “blanking,” “seeing red,” autonomic arousal). If there is planning/cover‑up, the defense ordinarily fails.
- Pre‑offense documentation (must have)
  - Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol: school IEP/discipline or juvenile/ED notes for explosive reactivity/dissociation; sleep disruption tied to environmental stressors. This addresses temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation.
- Neurocognitive findings with validity (must have)
  - At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on tasks directly related to inhibitory control (Stop‑Signal with SSRT, Go/No‑Go, antisaccade, flanker; add an affective variant such as emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop). Include delay discounting as supportive.
  - Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and, where possible, re‑test consistency. Down‑weight WCST; plain Stroop has low specificity.
  - Trait profile consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression (avoid overreliance on PCL‑R; if used, keep in low/moderate range and treat cautiously).
- Psychiatric linkage (should have)
  - Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) that maps plausibly onto the index event’s triggers; anchored to pre‑offense records, not post‑charge narrative. Biological stress corroboration (hair cortisol) is supportive, not determinative.
- Objective exposure biomarker (should have)
  - At least one developmental insult consistent with the proposed mechanism and documented independent of litigation: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or any ≥10), iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk; these strengthen the plausibility of persistent prefrontal control deficits.

Minimum “bundle” to meet clear and convincing
- Require all three “must haves” (event phenotype, pre‑offense documentation, neurocognitive deficits with validity), plus at least one of the two “should haves” (psychiatric linkage or exposure biomarker), and
- Satisfy exclusion criteria (below).
- Limit offense domain to reactive violent acts (and truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts in rare cases). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.

2) Evidentiary and procedural safeguards (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a standardized checklist; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Notice and document template: require raw neuro data, validity indices, testing conditions, and pre‑offense records (school/medical/CPS/housing/EPA/lead labs; geocoded address history).
- Testing window and standardization: complete neurocognitive testing within 30–90 days of the offense when feasible; control for sleep, meds, caffeine; re‑test or corroborate when variability is suspected.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will be illusory and skewed.

3) Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute effects.
- Primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI at the time of offense (unless separately addressed under insanity) defeat dyscontrol attribution.
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple PVTs, cross‑source consistency, collateral informants. Watch for “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles or selective task failure.
- Reverse causation/state‑trait: incarceration stress, acute sleep loss, or acute legal anxiety can flatten cortisol and impair testing; rely on pre‑offense records and, for stress biology, prefer hair cortisol (3‑month window) over single‑day salivary measures.
- Planning indicators: weapon procurement/positioning, victim luring, post‑event concealment or flight planning are strong contrary evidence.

4) Test‑ and marker‑specific guidance (to avoid overclaiming)
- Prefer SSRT/Go–No‑Go/antisaccade/flanker; include an affective variant. Down‑weight WCST; Stroop only as part of a broader battery.
- Treat hair cortisol as supportive of chronic load; single‑day diurnal salivary cortisol is noisy. HRV/threat‑startle are supportive only.
- Historic BLLs are probative of developmental insult if elevated during sensitive windows; they do not localize the moment of offense.
- Avoid fMRI/EEG for guilt‑phase determinations; if admitted, limit to educative, non‑determinative context with a strong limiting instruction.

5) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds and ecological validity: lab tasks are proxies with modest effect sizes; require cross‑task convergence and pre‑offense corroboration.
- Base‑rate neglect: many disadvantaged individuals will meet some criteria without moment‑of‑offense dyscontrol; insist on the event phenotype and temporality.
- Measurement invariance: ensure norms are appropriate (age, sex, race/SES) to avoid spurious deficits.
- “Neuro‑gloss” prejudice: balance probative value against unfair prejudice; deliver limiting instructions that no single test/scan can prove legal incapacity.

6) Burden and findings
- Defense burden: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act (not merely a background risk).
- Use special interrogatories (e.g., event‑level dyscontrol found? pre‑offense documentation? valid inhibition deficits? exclusion of intoxication?) to facilitate appellate review and promote uniformity.

7) Remedies to align with public legitimacy
- If the full bundle is not met, channel RSB to structured mitigation (including MPC‑style EED in homicide) rather than a complete excuse.
- Where the excuse succeeds, prefer ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision; reserve civil commitment (under ordinary standards) for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

Bottom line
The proposed batteries and markers, used alone, are not specific or temporally precise enough. Used together, anchored by a reactive event signature and pre‑offense records, with valid neurocognitive deficits and at least one mechanistic exposure, they can carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden in a narrow band of cases. The court’s job is to enforce convergence, police exclusions (especially intoxication and planning), and prevent neuroscience theater from displacing the core legal question: did this defendant lack a fair opportunity to conform at the moment in question?

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as givens, can you sketch a concrete, administrable framework for courts? Specifically: (1) a pretrial gatekeeping protocol (timing, Daubert hearing, neutral experts, burden as clear‑and‑convincing) that keeps Stage 1 background from swamping the guilt phase, and (2) a short, model jury instruction for a narrow RSB‑dyscontrol excuse that defines “substantial degradation of inhibitory control,” limits the excuse to reactive (not instrumental) violence, and squarely excludes voluntary intoxication. If you think bifurcation is essential, please say how you’d structure it and which offenses would be eligible.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

- Specificity and timing. None of the proposed instruments (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, Stroop, WCST, cortisol, historic BLLs) can pinpoint loss of control “at the moment.” They are admissible, if properly validated, only as probative of a stable vulnerability to reactive dyscontrol that, when paired with event‑level evidence, can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference. Courts should:
  - Give greatest weight to tasks closest to motor/affective inhibition (stop‑signal with credible SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop).
  - Downweight WCST (set‑shifting) and treat standard Stroop as supportive only.
  - Treat hair‑cortisol (3 cm segment) and childhood BLLs as chronic‑exposure corroborators; they are not temporal stamps.
  - Bar “brain scans” (fMRI/EEG) absent a Daubert/Frye foundation tying a lab paradigm to clinically meaningful, case‑specific inhibitory failure and known error rates.

- Gatekeeping architecture. To keep the gate tight and administrable, require convergence across domains plus the right offense signature, and resolve admissibility at a pretrial Daubert hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Impose a notice requirement and standardized proffers (school/CPS/medical/EPA/HUD/UI records; geocoded addresses).

Minimum bundle to reach clear‑and‑convincing (all must be met; any disqualifier defeats)

1) Event signature (reactive, not instrumental)
- Acute provocation with seconds–minutes latency; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions (“went blank/seeing red,” pronounced autonomic arousal). Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam, witness statements).

2) Pre‑offense documentary trail of dyscontrol (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, ED/clinic notes of dissociation/IED, juvenile records) and sleep disruption/crowding corroboration where relevant.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity and cross‑task convergence
- ≥2 inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below demographically appropriate norms (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal; antisaccade error rate; affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), plus a choice‑impulsivity index (delay discounting) if available.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded + stand‑alone) passed; consistency across sessions or tasks.
- Trait profile consistent with reactive (not predatory) aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in the high range), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index offense
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented exposures; symptom triggers plausibly explain the index event. Biological stress markers (flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or one ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to present executive deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver (BAC/TOX): defeats the excuse unless the defense proves baseline dyscontrol independent of acute substance effects.
- Clear instrumental motive (e.g., luring, retaliation planning, concealment) or post‑event goal‑directed behavior.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at offense; malingering (failed PVTs/inconsistent performance).

- Offense domain. Limit to reactive violent offenses (homicide, aggravated assault) and, rarely, truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts. Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes and cases involving weapon retrieval after a break in the encounter (re‑engagement after cooling).

- Jury management. Bifurcate. Use special interrogatories (e.g., reactive signature, substantial degradation of inhibitory control, substantial causal contribution). Give a clarifying instruction that this is an excuse (not a justification) and that an excuse finding triggers ESB‑oriented, court‑supervised dispositions, not an unconditional release.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, or acute incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions;, when feasible, repeat testing and rely on pre‑offense records; consider actigraphy or collateral sleep documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain. Require multiple PVTs, cross‑task consistency, and collateral informants; beware “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” or selective impairment patterns.
- Acute intoxication. Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; the law generally treats voluntary intoxication as non‑exculpatory. Distinguish historic toxin exposure (lead, FASD) from acute substance effects.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact. Post‑charge stress and practice effects can distort results; weight pre‑charge school/medical/CPS/EPA records heavily; use hair cortisol to capture pre‑offense windows.
- Base‑rate/specificity errors. Many with these deficits never offend; convergence with the event signature is critical to avoid Type I errors.
- Cultural/linguistic/test‑norm issues. Use demographically appropriate norms and qualified bilingual examiners; avoid masking impairment by over‑broad “SES adjustments,” but do not misclassify due to linguistic bias.
- fMRI/“brain porn.” Exclude or cabin neuroimaging absent a solid reliability showing and clear clinical relevance; jurors over‑weight pictures.

Implementation safeguards

- Court‑appointed neutral experts; funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Standardized matrix scoring at the admissibility phase (e.g., all five pillars present, no disqualifiers) to curb dueling‑expert sprawl.
- Special verdicts and bifurcated instructions to protect public legitimacy.

Bottom line. Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 elements are directionally sound if tightly specified and coupled to event‑level proof. Dr. Chen is right that science cannot time‑stamp control failure; the law can still reach a clear‑and‑convincing inference by demanding alignment across mechanism (developmental insult + chronic stress), trait (validated inhibitory deficits), history (pre‑offense dyscontrol), and moment (reactive signature), and by rigorously excluding alternative proximate causes.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your evidentiary hat, assume we adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate with Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution. What would your model gatekeeping order and core jury instruction look like to make this administrable and legitimacy‑preserving? Please specify: (i) pretrial proffer requirements and a Daubert‑style checklist (including how you would cabin offense types and exclude voluntary intoxication/instrumental crimes); (ii) the burden and standard for the defense; and (iii) a concise instruction that tells jurors what “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” means and how to weigh converging vs. single‑strand evidence—while minimizing risk of confusion or de facto nullification.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Bottom line from a judge’s vantage: none of the Stage 2 tools pin volitional loss to the exact moment, but a tightly constrained, convergent bundle can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a small class of truly reactive cases. The court must insist on alignment across event signature, pre‑offense documentation, objective exposures, and valid testing, with bright‑line disqualifiers.

Are the proposed measures specific/temporal enough?
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal, Go/No‑Go, antisaccade; Stroop only as a supplement) index trait‑level inhibitory control with moderate specificity; they are state‑sensitive and not time‑stamped.
- WCST is weakly tied to the mechanism; downweight or replace with affective inhibition tasks (emotional Go/No‑Go/Stroop) and delay‑discounting.
- Stress markers (hair cortisol for chronic load; diurnal salivary profiles are noisy) and historic BLLs are mechanistically plausible but not moment‑specific.
- In short: individually insufficient; probative only when they cohere with pre‑offense records and an event pattern of reactive dyscontrol.

Minimum bundle I would require (all must be met) to reach clear and convincing:
1) Reactive event signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; no luring/staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous accounts (“went blank,” somatic arousal) or video/911/body‑cam corroboration.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School/juvenile/clinical records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound rages, dissociation, IED/PTSD symptoms, chronic sleep disruption; not created for litigation.

3) Valid neurocognitive profile
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal, antisaccade errors, affective Go/No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and consistency across sessions or cross‑test convergence; impulsive choice (elevated delay discounting) supportive.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (avoid overreliance on PCL‑R; if used, low–moderate range only and not dispositive).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index act
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, IED) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented adversity, with triggers/symptoms plausibly explaining the index offense.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or single ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; FASD risk), with a plausible tie to current executive deficits.

And all of these disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse. Presence of substances requires showing baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Planning/Instrumentality: evidence of advance weapon acquisition for the episode, luring, coordination with co‑actors, concealment, or post‑event instrumental steps presumptively defeats the defense.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded/stand‑alone PVTs, cross‑informant collateral, stability across time.
- Alternative causes excluded: primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the incident, clear pecuniary/retaliatory motives inconsistent with reflexive aggression.
- Temporality: testing as early as practicable; heavy weight on pre‑charge records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Scientific pitfalls to police under Rule 702/Daubert:
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication, legal stress depressing executive scores/cortisol; standardize conditions, repeat where feasible, corroborate with historic records/actigraphy.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: hair cortisol (ethnicity/treatment confounds) and fMRI/EEG should be treated as supportive at best; fMRI generally inadmissible for individual diagnosis.
- WCST/PCL‑R misuse: WCST is nonspecific; PCL‑R has known limitations and potential bias—do not let it drive the conclusion.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: population links (lead, ACEs) do not establish individual causation absent the full bundle.
- Lab‑shopping/data quality: require chain of custody for environmental/medical records; prefer government/public health labs; appoint neutral experts.
- Reverse causation: incarceration/post‑offense stress can alter biomarkers; use hair cortisol to capture pre‑offense window and rely on pre‑offense documentation.

Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert hearing keyed to a court checklist reflecting the bundle and disqualifiers above.
- Neutral, court‑appointed experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Limit the doctrine to affective/reactive violence (and rare truly impulsive nonviolent acts); channel failures to sentencing mitigation when the bundle is incomplete.

Jury instruction
- Emphasize Hart’s fairness limit: jurors may consider dyscontrol only if they find both (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act, not merely that compliance was harder than average.

This approach keeps the gate narrow, aligns with administrability and public legitimacy, and ensures that when we excuse, we do so because the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply at the moment—not simply because adversity made compliance difficult.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming the court adopts Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution, please draft a model jury instruction for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse. Specify: (i) the clear‑and‑convincing burden; (ii) the definition of “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense”; (iii) the limited evidentiary factors the jury may consider (reactive event signature, pre‑offense records, validated neurocognitive deficits, documented biological insults, trauma diagnosis) and disqualifiers (planning, concealment, voluntary intoxication, malingering); and (iv) a caution against sympathy/character judgments. Would you require a special verdict form and unanimity on each element?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage architecture is the right shape, and Stage 2 goes to the right question: did the defendant lack a fair opportunity to conform at the moment of the offense? But to be administrable and perceived as fair, the attribution gate must be tighter, focused on an automatism‑like “involuntary‑rage” episode. My view:

1) Offense domain and burden
- Limit to reactive, affective violence with minimal forethought; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Treat as an affirmative excuse with a clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that substantial volitional control was degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

2) Stage 2 minimum bundle (all required)
- Event signature: Close temporal proximity to a salient trigger; disorganized execution; absence of planning or concealment; contemporaneous corroboration (911/body‑cam/video or multiple witnesses). Any evidence of luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental conduct defeats the excuse.
- Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol: Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.
- Neurocognitive deficits with validity: At least two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go and an affective variant such as emotional Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus intact performance‑validity testing; low‑to‑moderate psychopathic trait profile to fit a reactive, not predatory, pattern. Prefer stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence.
- Psychiatric linkage: Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to pre‑existing exposures and plausibly mapping to the index event (triggers, dissociation). Biological stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) are supportive only.
- Objective developmental insult: At least one independently documented exposure consistent with mechanism (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated or ≥10 once; verified early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia; documented FASD risk) that pre‑dated and plausibly contributes to present executive deficits.

3) Disqualifiers and alternative causes (any one defeats)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at the time of offense.
- Strong evidence of instrumental motive or planning.
- Malingering/forensic artifact: failed performance‑validity tests; profiles that collapse on retest; absence of any pre‑offense corroboration.

4) Scientific and evidentiary pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, and incarceration stress depress performance and cortisol; prefer early testing plus repetition and, crucially, pre‑offense records.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: Do not infer individual causation from group correlations; require the full bundle above.
- Over‑weighting shiny biomarkers: fMRI/EEG are not time‑of‑offense gauges; admit, if at all, only as background.
- Intoxication creep: Separate developmental toxins (lead, FASD) from acute voluntary substances.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; seek cross‑source consistency (family, teachers, medical charts).

5) Procedural safeguards
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to the specified elements; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and standardized proffers: geocoded address histories; school, CPS, UI, medical, EPA/HUD records.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants to avoid wealth‑based access.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions: In the guilt phase, instruct that background is relevant only insofar as it shows substantial impairment at the time of the act; general adversity alone is insufficient. Reserve broader life‑history narrative for sentencing.

6) Relationship to other doctrines and disposition
- Outside this narrow involuntary‑rage lane, channel homicide cases to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (mitigation, not excuse), and otherwise argue RSB at sentencing with validated deprivation indicators.
- If the excuse succeeds, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused treatment, safe housing, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines). Use civil commitment only if the person remains dangerous and meets statutory criteria.

Why this won’t open the floodgates
Requiring convergence across event‑level phenomenology, pre‑offense documentation, validated neurocognitive deficits, a structured psychiatric diagnosis, and an objective developmental insult—plus excluding intoxication and planning—will confine the excuse to a very small subset of reactive violence cases. The rest of RSB’s moral force belongs at sentencing, where we can reduce punishment in a principled, transparent way without diluting culpability at guilt.

---

### Speaker: Host

Given Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, what concrete doctrinal architecture would you adopt to keep this administrable? Please be specific: (i) a Daubert-style pretrial checklist the judge should apply (which measures are admissible, how to handle validity tests, voluntary intoxication, and timing); and (ii) a model, one‑paragraph jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and limiting the excuse to reactive violence. Also indicate the burden of proof you’d set and your preferred standard of appellate review for sufficiency of the evidence on this excuse.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you, Chair. Wearing my administrability hat, I would translate Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 into a courtroom‑usable, narrow gate keyed to reactive, automatism‑like episodes. Dr. Chen is right that no single measure time‑stamps loss of control; what matters is disciplined convergence plus strong exclusion of alternatives.

What I would require (clear and convincing; defense burden)

1) Event signature consistent with transient reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid onset (seconds, not long minutes) in response to a salient provocation; brief duration; disorganized execution; no staging, luring, or concealment.
- Contemporaneous indicia: 911/body‑cam/video or credible witness accounts of “blanking out,” marked autonomic arousal, post‑event confusion. If there is planning, weapon staging, pursuit, or calm post‑event management, the excuse fails.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- Records predating the offense (school discipline/IEPs, pediatric or ED notes, juvenile files) showing stimulus‑bound explosive reactivity, dissociation, or similar episodes. This is the best antidote to reverse causation and coached narratives.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity safeguards, focused on inhibition under affect
- At least two deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go with reliable SSRT; antisaccade; affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), with:
  - Multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests passed;
  - Stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence; and
  - Low–moderate psychopathic traits (to support an impulsive, not predatory, phenotype).
- I would down‑weight WCST; it is not specific to inhibitory control. fMRI/EEG, if offered, should be treated as at most corroborative and almost never dispositive under Daubert.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps onto the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) plausibly tied to documented exposures; symptom content and triggers that coherently explain the index episode.
- Supportive (not required) chronic stress markers: hair cortisol flattening; low resting HF‑HRV. One day of salivary cortisol is too noisy to carry weight.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult during sensitive periods (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—or a single ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to present executive deficits.

Mandatory exclusions (“red flags”)
- Voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (alcohol/stimulants) defeats the excuse; at most it may mitigate under ordinary doctrines.
- Strong evidence of instrumental motive, calculated planning, or concealment.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures (a different doctrine).
- Malingering: failure on validity testing, internally inconsistent test profiles, divergence from pre‑offense history.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, legal stress, meds can depress test scores. Standardize testing conditions; prefer repeated testing; anchor in pre‑offense records.
- Post‑charge artifacts: cortisol and cognition can shift in custody; hair cortisol (3‑month window) and historic labs are preferable to single salivary samples.
- “Brain overclaim” risk: do not let colorful imaging or single biomarkers substitute for functional evidence and event‑level fit.
- Criterion creep: keep the domain to affective/reactive violence; do not migrate this excuse into acquisitive, planned offenses (those are for EED/mitigation if at all).

Procedural guardrails
- Notice and a pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing keyed to the five‑pillar showing above; use court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Standardized documentary proffers (geocoded exposure histories; medical/CPS/school/housing/EPA records) and performance‑validity reporting.
- Bifurcation and a focused jury instruction: the question is not whether life was hard, but whether, at the moment of the act, the defendant’s capacity to choose was transiently overborne such that the conduct was not the product of a conscious exercise of will.

Model limiting instruction (gist)
- “You may consider evidence of deprivation and exposure only insofar as it bears on whether, at the time of the act, the defendant experienced a transient loss of self‑regulatory control so substantial that the conduct was not the product of a conscious exercise of choice. Mere anger, stress, or difficult circumstances do not suffice. If you find planning, instrumental motives, or voluntary intoxication were the proximate cause, you must reject this excuse.”

Disposition pathway
- If the excuse is found, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision with targeted interventions (trauma therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep remediation, job pipelines) and risk management; reserve civil commitment for those who remain dangerous and meet statutory criteria.
- If the showing falls short, the same evidence can be channeled to MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or to structured mitigation at sentencing tied to validated deprivation indicators.

Bottom line
Santiago’s Stage 2 can be made courtroom‑reliable if we (i) confine it to reactive violence; (ii) demand the five‑pillar convergence with validity checks; and (iii) enforce the exclusions. That will keep the category narrow—closer to a modern automatism—preserve fairness in Hart’s sense, and protect public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

From an evidentiary and administrability standpoint, can a trial court realistically manage Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle without derailing trials? What Daubert factors would you emphasize to screen the proposed neurocognitive and stress evidence, would you appoint neutral experts, and how would you structure the jury charge to (i) define “substantial volitional impairment” and (ii) cabin the doctrine to reactive offenses while excluding voluntary intoxication and instrumental motives? Please be concrete—offer a short model instruction and any categorical exclusions or presumptions you’d codify.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

On the science, I largely align with Dr. Chen: none of these instruments time‑stamps volitional loss; they are corroborative, not dispositive. If we are to run a dyscontrol excuse without losing the plot, courts should demand a convergent, pre‑specified bundle and police the negatives ruthlessly. Here is what I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard, and how I would cabin it administratively.

A. Minimum convergence (no single element sufficient)

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; seconds/minutes, not hours.
- Disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment.
- Contemporaneous indicia: “saw red/went blank,” tremor/tachycardia, bystander accounts, 911/body‑cam/video if available.
- If there is planning, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental behavior, the defense presumptively fails.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense: school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes, ED visits for rage/dissociation, chronic sleep disruption tied to environment. This is the best antidote to reverse causation and forensic artifact.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity and replication
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop). Downweight WCST; it is not specific to inhibition.
- Include impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available.
- Multiple performance‑validity measures (embedded and stand‑alone) passed; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Low/moderate psychopathy scores consistent with impulsive rather than predatory aggression (used cautiously).

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response in the instant event.
- Supportive but not required: chronic stress signatures (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) interpreted cautiously.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated or any ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk), coupled with social deprivation indicators from Stage 1 (housing, school, violence exposure).
- The point is dose–response/temporality: exposures predate and plausibly contribute to current inhibitory deficits.

B. Disqualifiers/alternative‑cause controls

- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. A history of toxin exposure is not a license to drink/use and claim dyscontrol.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB belongs in insanity, not here.
- Malingering: fail PVTs, inconsistent performance, or “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles—no go.
- Clear instrumental motive, luring, or cover‑up—no go.

C. Scientific pitfalls to watch

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, pain, and legal stress depress executive performance and cortisol—standardize testing conditions; where feasible, retest and triangulate with pre‑offense records.
- Forensic artifact: hair cortisol helps with pre‑offense windows; do not over‑weight post‑charge salivary cortisol or single session task performance.
- fMRI/EEG glamour: admissible, if at all, as weakly supportive background; they do not answer the legal question and carry undue prejudice.
- SES/race bias and “culture shopping”: insist on objective historical records and court‑appointed neutral experts; avoid essentializing “subculture.”

D. Procedural guardrails

- Daubert/Kumho hearing keyed to a structured checklist (like Prof. Santiago’s Stage 1 + this Stage 2 bundle).
- Notice and standardized document proffers (CPS, school, UI, EPA/HUD, medical labs; geocoded residence histories).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; equal resources for indigent defendants.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.
- Offense limitation: reactive interpersonal violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.

E. Jury instruction (to keep the doctrine honest)

- Define the excuse as absence of a fair opportunity to conform due to substantial, temporary degradation of inhibitory control at the moment of offense.
- Emphasize: not mere anger, poverty, or bad character; not a license for voluntary intoxication; not available where planning or instrumental motive is shown.
- Provide an “imperfect” backstop in homicide—MPC‑style EED—where dyscontrol is shown but not to the level of excuse.

F. Disposition

- If excused: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation away from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pathways), with risk review; civil commitment available if the person remains demonstrably dangerous.
- If the excuse fails but the record shows substantial deprivation, use it at sentencing under validated mitigation frameworks.

With these constraints, you get alignment with Hart’s fairness limit without opening the floodgates. Requiring convergence across event signature, pre‑offense history, validated cognitive deficits, a mapped psychiatric syndrome, and an objective exposure marker—plus strict exclusions—will confine the excuse to the rare case where mechanism and moment truly line up.

---

### Speaker: Host

Given Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, please sketch a model black‑letter rule and companion jury instruction for a narrow RSB dyscontrol excuse that an appellate court could defend on administrability grounds. In particular: (i) the pretrial gate (Daubert‑style hearing, content of the defense proffer, use of neutral court‑appointed experts); (ii) the precise elements the jury must find and the burden of proof; (iii) a special verdict form structure to capture those findings; and (iv) limiting instructions to prevent misuse/overweighting of neuro/biomarker evidence and to distinguish this excuse from insanity/diminished capacity. Keep it tight enough to minimize error costs and preserve public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I largely agree with Dr. Chen’s bottom line: none of these measures can time‑stamp volitional failure to the moment. They can, however, make a clear‑and‑convincing showing that, in a narrow class of reactive cases, inhibitory control was substantially degraded and causally contributory. From a court’s perspective, three points matter: specificity to the mechanism (inhibition/affect regulation), temporal anchoring (pre‑offense documentation and event‑level corroboration), and administrability (tight gatekeeping to avoid jury confusion and unequal application).

1) Are the proposed tools specific and temporally sensitive enough?
- Specificity: The inhibition tasks (stop‑signal/go–no‑go; antisaccade; affective variants) are the most on‑point. Stroop/WCST are only modestly tied to the mechanism and should be down‑weighted. Historic blood lead and documented early malnutrition are mechanistically plausible contributors to prefrontal dyscontrol; they are not dispositive but strengthen causal plausibility when paired with current inhibitory deficits. Cortisol metrics are, at best, supportive of chronic stress load; they are non‑specific.
- Temporality: None of these assays shows “what happened at 3:12 p.m.” You get temporal confidence by (i) pre‑offense records of dyscontrol and exposure (school, medical, CPS, housing, EPA), and (ii) event‑level features consistent with a reactive, dissociative episode. Absent those anchors, the science is too elastic for a guilt‑phase excuse.

2) Minimum converging bundle I would require (clear and convincing; no single element sufficient)
A. Event signature (indispensable)
- Rapid escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/staging/cover‑up; contemporaneous witness/video/911/body‑cam describing “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal, post‑event confusion. If there is planning or instrumental conduct, the excuse should presumptively fail.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (indispensable)
- Non‑forensic, pre‑charge records evidencing episodic loss of control or affective reactivity (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive behavior; juvenile or primary‑care notes; ED visits for rage/dissociation; chronic sleep disruption tied to environment). This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation.

C. Neurocognitive/psychiatric linkage (with validity safeguards)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective go–no‑go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests and, ideally, replication or cross‑task convergence.
- A trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established by a qualified clinician with structured tools, and symptom content that plausibly maps to the index trigger. I would not admit fMRI as determinative; at most, supportive.
- I would avoid heavy reliance on PCL‑R in this posture; at most, use low scores as weak corroboration of a reactive (not predatory) profile, mindful of its limitations and bias risks.

D. Objective exposure biomarker (at least one)
- Independent, pre‑offense proof of a developmental biological insult (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—or a prior ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk). This is not about momentary intoxication; it is about formative insult consistent with current executive deficits.

E. Exclusion of alternative proximate drivers (indispensable)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication at the time of offense defeats the excuse. Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless you are actually litigating insanity), acute TBI at the scene, malingering (multiple PVTs, consistency checks), and clear instrumental motives.

If any of A, B, or E is missing, the case should not go to a jury on a dyscontrol excuse. Absent C or D, it may still be powerful mitigation at sentencing, but not an excuse at guilt. In homicide, this same package—without the stronger automatism showing—fits cleanly within MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance.

3) Scientific and evidentiary pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, or incarceration stress degrade test performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing, repeat when feasible, and weigh pre‑offense records heavily.
- Malingering and coaching: Require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity indices; be wary of selective “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles; insist on cross‑source collateral.
- Acute intoxication: Do not let chronic “toxin history” morph into a cover for voluntary alcohol/stimulant effects at the moment.
- Reverse causation and forensic artifact: Post‑charge stress and secondary gain can drive both symptoms and test results. Weight contemporaneous event data and prior records over post‑hoc narratives.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate error: Neighborhood statistics and high ACEs are not causation. Use them only as context.
- Measurement inequities: Norms for neurocognitive tasks and interpretation of cortisol/hair assays can vary by culture and physiology; ensure experts address representativeness and confounds (e.g., hair treatments).
- Complexity/jury confusion: Rule 403 balancing matters; avoid mini‑trials on marginally probative science.

4) Gatekeeping and administration (to keep the doctrine narrow and legitimate)
- Daubert/Rule 702 pretrial hearing with a structured checklist keyed to the elements above; no single‑expert “global opinions.” Appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health for indigent cases.
- Notice and reciprocal discovery with deadlines; standardized documentary proofs (lab reports, CPS/school, housing/EPA, UI records; geocoded address histories).
- Offense domain: Confine to reactive interpersonal violence and, exceptionally, truly impulsive non‑violent outbursts. Planned acquisitive crimes are out.
- Burden and instruction: Defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation substantially contributed to the act. Give a specialized instruction distinguishing this excuse from anger or character and clarifying that poverty alone is never enough.
- Channeling: If the event‑level involuntariness showing is strong (dissociation/automatism), try it under an “involuntary act” theory. If weaker but still compelling in homicide, use MPC extreme emotional disturbance. Otherwise, reserve RSB for sentencing mitigation keyed to verified indicators.

5) Disposition
Where the excuse is found, I favor ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep remediation, employment supports), with civil commitment available only if the person meets standard dangerousness criteria. That approach protects victims prospectively and preserves public legitimacy without converting RSB into a blanket exculpation.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 criteria, as tightened by Dr. Chen, can support a narrow dyscontrol excuse if courts demand the full bundle: event‑level reactivity, pre‑offense documentation, valid inhibition deficits, at least one developmental biological insult, and exclusion of alternative proximate causes. Anything less belongs at sentencing, not guilt.

### Speaker: Host

Given Prof. Santiago’s Stage 1–2 framework and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, would you make an objective “biological insult” (e.g., childhood BLLs, FASD, iron-deficiency anemia) a required element of an RSB–dyscontrol excuse, or allow cases to proceed on cumulative psychosocial deprivation plus neurocognitive/psychiatric evidence alone? Please answer in terms of administrability and error costs: which choice better balances false positives vs. false negatives, and how would you encode that choice in a pretrial gatekeeping order and a jury instruction?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you, Chair. Wearing my gatekeeping hat, I largely agree with Dr. Chen’s scientific bottom line and will translate it into administrable courtroom requirements. None of these tools can time‑stamp loss of control; the law will get reliability only by demanding convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment.

What I would require before giving a dyscontrol instruction (clear and convincing; defense burden)

A. Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol (must have)
- Salient, acute provocation; seconds–minutes to offense; disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (911/body‑cam/video/witness statements) of “blanking,” “seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal, confusion.
- If there is planning or post‑event instrumental behavior, the defense presumptively fails.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (must have)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile MH notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption tied to neighborhood stress).
- This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity (must have)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks most tied to the mechanism (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop). WCST adds little to inhibition; downweight it. Include delay‑discounting if available.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) passed; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Low–moderate trait psychopathy (e.g., PCL‑R not in the high range), supporting an impulsive rather than predatory profile.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event (strongly preferred; if absent, the other pillars must be exceptionally strong)
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the trigger and response in the index event.
- Chronic stress corroboration (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive only.

E. Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism (must have at least one, documented pre‑litigation)
- Childhood blood lead (repeated ≥5 µg/dL or any ≥10 µg/dL) during sensitive windows; or documented FASD risk; or iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; or comparable biological insult. These do not prove momentary loss of control but increase causal plausibility when paired with C and D.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause defeats the excuse. If substances were present, there must be persuasive evidence of baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple validity indices, consistency across sessions, collateral reports; beware “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the event, and clear instrumental motives.
- Standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine); where feasible, repeat testing; lean on pre‑offense records to avoid the “forensic artifact” problem.

Relative probative weight
- Heavy: contemporaneous event evidence; pre‑offense school/medical/juvenile records; SSRT/antisaccade/affective inhibition tasks with validity; childhood BLLs or similar exposure; structured PTSD/IED diagnosis tied to documented exposures.
- Light/supportive only: diurnal salivary cortisol (single‑day), WCST, generic Stroop, HRV, post‑charge neuroimaging. fMRI/EEG should not be primary proof; they carry Rule 403 risks and, absent pre‑registered paradigms and independent review, are better excluded or tightly limited.

Procedural guardrails (to keep the gate narrow and even‑handed)
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing keyed to testability, peer review, known error rates, standards, and general acceptance; require a structured proffer mapping each item above to offered evidence.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; parity funding for indigent defendants (Ake‑style) or the doctrine will skew toward the well‑resourced.
- Standardized templates for objective records (geocoded residence/exposure histories; BLLs; CPS/school/IEP; housing/EPA/HUD; medical/labs).
- Limit offense domain to reactive violent offenses and a narrow class of truly impulsive nonviolent acts; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.

Scientific pitfalls courts should watch for
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication changes can depress executive performance and flatten cortisol. Use hair cortisol (3‑month window) rather than single‑day saliva; corroborate with pre‑offense records and, where possible, repeat testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity checks; be wary of selective, nonbiological impairment patterns.
- Acute intoxication: separates mechanism (developmental toxins) from proximate cause (alcohol/drugs); the latter generally defeats the excuse.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense stress can create abnormalities; emphasize records predating the offense.
- Base‑rate neglect and tunnel vision: executive deficits are not rare; no single marker is specific to legal dyscontrol. Demand multi‑source convergence.
- Cultural/test bias: ensure norms appropriate to the defendant’s language and education; use qualified bilingual examiners where relevant.

Jury instruction guardrails (to preserve legitimacy)
- Make clear this is not a “poverty defense.” Jurors may consider environmental deprivation only insofar as they find it substantially degraded inhibitory control at the time of the offense and was a substantial contributing cause of the act. Mere exposure to disadvantage is insufficient.
- Define “substantial impairment” and “substantial cause” in plain terms; emphasize the reactive‑versus‑instrumental distinction.

Bottom line
The proposed batteries and markers are not individually decisive and are only weakly time‑sensitive. As a bundle—when aligned with event‑level behavior and pre‑offense documentation, with alternative causes excluded—they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a small subset of cases. If courts hold the line on the mandatory pillars, neutral expertise, and offense limits, we can honor Hart’s fair‑opportunity principle without opening the floodgates. Dispositions should be ESB‑oriented with supervision, and civil commitment remains available where danger persists.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle into courtroom mechanics? Specifically: (a) outline the Daubert/Frye gatekeeping checklist you would apply at a pretrial hearing (what must be proffered, by whom, with what sources) and (b) draft a concise model jury instruction defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and “reactive dyscontrol,” setting the clear‑and‑convincing burden, and expressly excluding voluntary intoxication and planned/instrumental crimes. Please keep it tight and operational—what would you actually put on the record and read to jurors?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally right: no single assay can time‑stamp “loss of control,” so we must demand alignment across mechanism, history, and the moment. But to keep this administrable and narrow, I would tighten three things: (i) what counts; (ii) how much is enough; and (iii) how to police common errors.

1) Specificity and temporal sensitivity
- The proposed cognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) and exposure markers (historic blood lead; documented early malnutrition; hair/diurnal cortisol) are, at best, trait‑leaning indicators that make impaired control plausible. They are not moment‑of‑offense meters. They must be corroborative, not dispositive.
- Event‑level evidence (near‑instant escalation, disorganized execution, contemporaneous descriptions of dissociation/“seeing red,” absence of planning) carries the temporal load. Without a “reactive signature,” the lab findings should not carry the day.

2) Minimum bundle to meet clear and convincing evidence
Require all of A–C and at least two of D–F, plus G (exclusions). At least one element must rest on pre‑offense, nonforensic records.

A. Reactive event signature (must)
- Acute provocation to violence in seconds/minutes; no luring/staging/cover‑up; bodycam/911/witnesses support dissociation or autonomic arousal.

B. Pre‑offense dyscontrol documentation (must)
- Independent records predating the offense (school IEPs/discipline, ED/clinic notes, juvenile files) of stimulus‑bound rage, dissociation, or explosive reactivity.

C. Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity (must)
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), replicated or convergent across tasks, with multiple passed performance‑validity tests. Add a choice‑impulsivity measure (delay discounting) where feasible. PCL‑R in low–moderate range, if used, only as a rough phenotype check.

D. Clinically anchored diagnosis mapping to the event
- Structured assessment (e.g., CAPS‑5, SCID) supporting PTSD (dissociative subtype), Intermittent Explosive Disorder, or related condition, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index act.

E. Objective developmental insult supporting mechanism
- Childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (preferably multiple, or any ≥10), or documented FASD risk, or iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive windows, evidenced in contemporaneous medical/public health records.

F. Physiological corroboration of chronic stress (supportive)
- Flattened hair cortisol (prior 3 months) or robust multi‑day diurnal profiles; low resting HF‑HRV. Treat as supportive only; do not require or over‑weight.

G. Exclusions/controls (must)
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; no primary psychosis/mania/TBI explaining the act; credible effort (multiple PVTs); timing safeguards (testing as soon as practicable, reliance on pre‑charge records to blunt “forensic artifact”).

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress depress executive performance and cortisol. Standardize testing; prefer repeated/corroborated results and pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: insist on multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; beware selectively “catastrophic” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication should presumptively defeat this excuse.
- Reverse causation and post hoc testing: heavy reliance on post‑charge labs invites error; weight pre‑offense pediatric/CPS/school/EPA‑HUD records far more heavily.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: fMRI/EEG should be inadmissible or strictly limited to pedagogy; hair cortisol has ethnic/treatment confounds; lead inferences from housing orders alone are weak without labs.
- Base‑rate/halo error: do not let high deprivation scores substitute for case‑level causation; avoid importing “societal fault” into guilt.

4) Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert/Kumho hearing tied to a structured checklist; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); standardized proffer (geocoded exposure history; medical/CPS/school/UI/EPA records).
- Limit the doctrine to genuinely reactive violent offenses (and, rarely, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Jury instruction that these tools do not “measure free will,” but, if credited, may show the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform in that moment (Hart’s limit). Use a special verdict form on each element.

5) Disposition
Where the excuse is found, I would not default to simple release. Use ESB‑oriented conditions (trauma therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports) under court supervision; reserve civil commitment for those shown dangerous under ordinary standards.

Bottom line: Santiago’s Stage 2 components are the right families of proof, but only a convergent bundle—with event‑level reactivity, pre‑offense documentation, valid inhibition deficits, and at least one objective developmental insult, together with tight exclusions—should clear a clear‑and‑convincing threshold. This keeps the gate narrow, preserves legitimacy, and aligns with a fair‑opportunity conception of culpability.

---

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and legitimacy standpoint, could you draft a concise model jury instruction for a narrowly tailored “reactive dyscontrol” (RSB) excuse? Please phrase it in juror‑friendly language and specify: (i) the elements the defendant must prove (e.g., substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the act, causally linked to documented cumulative deprivation/biological insult); (ii) key exclusions (e.g., voluntary intoxication as proximate cause, planned/instrumental offenses, malingering); and (iii) the burden/standard of proof. Aim for something a trial judge could give after a pretrial gatekeeping ruling, to minimize “battle of experts” confusion.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s architecture and Dr. Chen’s cautions. None of the Stage 2 tools is specific or time‑precise standing alone; the only way this is administrable is through a narrow, pre‑specified convergence showing, with bright‑line exclusions and rigorous gatekeeping.

Are the proposed measures sufficient?
- As supporting evidence, yes—if and only if they line up with an event signature of reactive aggression and are tied to pre‑offense documentation. Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go and affective inhibition tasks are the most probative of the lot; Stroop and WCST are lower‑value adjuncts. Historic lead levels, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, and hair cortisol add plausibility but cannot time‑stamp impairment.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing (I would require all of A–E, plus the disqualifiers):
A) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation after a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous signs of autonomic arousal or dissociation (ideally corroborated by video/911/body‑cam or neutral witnesses).

B) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School, juvenile, medical, or CPS records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound outbursts, dissociation, sleep disruption, or explosive reactivity; not created for litigation.

C) Neurocognitive profile with validity and demographic corrections
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below appropriate demographic norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and either (i) replication on a second session or (ii) cross‑test convergence.
- Low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits (to fit an impulsive—not predatory—pattern).

D) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the incident
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptom triggers plausibly tied to the index event; chronic stress marker (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

E) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a ≥10 µg/dL spike; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), temporally preceding the measured executive deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; mere co‑presence requires showing baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania, acute TBI at the scene, malingering (multiple PVTs), and clear instrumental motives (planning, concealment, gain).
- Testing within ~60–90 days with standardized conditions (sleep, meds) and heavy reliance on pre‑charge records to avoid “forensic artifact” effects.

Scientific/legal pitfalls the court should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication changes can depress performance and flatten cortisol; standardize, repeat, or corroborate.
- Malingering and coaching: require multiple embedded/stand‑alone validity measures; beware selective “too bad” deficits and symptom over‑reporting.
- Demographic norming: use demographically corrected norms to avoid false positives in disadvantaged populations.
- Over‑weighting weak markers: WCST, generic Stroop, single‑day salivary cortisol, and glossy fMRI images should be treated as adjunctive at best; no single modality should carry the day.
- Reverse causation and record integrity: prefer contemporaneous, third‑party records (school, clinic, EPA/HUD, lab results) with chain‑of‑custody or official certification.
- Substance confounding: carefully separate developmental toxin history (e.g., lead) from acute drug/alcohol effects.

Gatekeeping and procedure
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tethered to a standardized checklist mirroring A–E above; defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to reduce partisan science.
- Notice and a documentary template (geocoded exposure history; certified school/health/CPS/UI/EPA/HUD records).
- Limit domain: reactive violent offenses (and, rarely, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptive exclusion for planned acquisitive crimes.

Jury instruction (to preserve administrability and legitimacy)
- Bifurcation or a specialized instruction stating: the defense must prove that, at the time of the act, defendant’s capacity to conform conduct to law was substantially impaired and that this impairment was a substantial contributing cause; poverty alone is never sufficient; voluntary intoxication cannot supply the impairment.
- Emphasize that biomarkers and tests are supportive only if they align with the event signature and pre‑offense history.

Disposition
- If excuse found, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused treatment, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep remediation, job pathways), with civil commitment reserved for those demonstrably dangerous.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 framework is directionally right. Dr. Chen is correct that we cannot time‑stamp control loss, but a tight, convergent bundle—event signature + pre‑offense records + two‑domain inhibitory deficits with validity + a fitting diagnosis + at least one objective developmental insult, and strict exclusions—can get us to clear‑and‑convincing in a small subset of cases. Anything looser risks floodgates, inequality, and loss of public confidence.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming we accept Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle, design the court’s gatekeeping architecture so it’s administrable and doesn’t collapse into a back‑door insanity plea. Specifically: what should a pretrial Daubert‑style proffer and findings look like (elements the judge must expressly find), and what lean model jury instruction would you give if the gate is cleared to focus jurors on “reactive dyscontrol at the moment” rather than global character or hardship? Please be concrete about burden, scope limits (e.g., reactive violence only), and how to prevent evidentiary sprawl while preserving fairness to the defense.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s bottom line: no single test or biomarker can time‑stamp loss of control at the moment of the offense. But a tightly specified bundle, aligned on mechanism, history, and the event, can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a narrow class of reactive cases. The court’s task is evidentiary fit and disciplined gatekeeping under Rule 702/Daubert and Rule 403.

1) What the science can and cannot do
- Specificity/temporality: SSRT/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade tasks are the closest probes of inhibitory control, but they are state‑sensitive and not moment‑specific. Cortisol (saliva) is noisy; hair cortisol gives a 2–3 month window of chronic load, not an index‑moment reading. Historic BLLs speak to developmental insult, not momentary control.
- Role of biomarkers: Exposure markers (childhood lead, documented malnutrition/FASD risk) and chronic stress signatures are corroborative. They gain probative value only when they line up with (a) pre‑offense dyscontrol and (b) a reactive, disorganized event.

2) Minimum converging bundle I would require (all must be present; clear and convincing burden on the defense)
A. Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; seconds to minutes, not hours; disorganized execution; no evidence of luring, staging, concealment, or post‑event instrumental behavior.
- Corroboration via witnesses/video/911/body‑cam; contemporaneous descriptions of “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal. If planning or cover‑up is present, this prong fails.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (non‑forensic)
- Records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, prior ED visits for rage/dissociation, juvenile mental health notes, sleep disruption tied to neighborhood conditions. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity safeguards
- At least two inhibitory/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade error rates, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and either repeat testing or cross‑test convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive aggression (low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits), used cautiously.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured DSM‑5 diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) rendered by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the trigger‑bound eruption. Biological stress indices (flattened hair cortisol, low HF‑HRV) are supportive, not required.

E. Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented developmental insult: repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (or any ≥10), iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or well‑documented prenatal alcohol/drug exposure consistent with FASD risk. The point is dose–response plausibility with C and D, not a talisman.

And all of the following exclusions must be met:
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/stimulant intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering: multiple PVTs, consistency across sessions, and collateral informant reports. “Too bad to be true” or selective impairment profiles are disqualifying.
- Alternative causes: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time of offense, or clear instrumental motives (retaliation/financial gain/status).
- Timing: testing conducted as early as practicable (30–60 days) and triangulated with pre‑offense records to avoid forensic artifact.

3) Scientific/evidentiary pitfalls the court should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, acute legal stress, medications can depress performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; consider actigraphy or collateral sleep data; prefer pre‑offense documentation.
- Base rate/ecological fallacy: poverty‑linked exposures are common; do not slide from group correlation to individual excuse absent the full bundle and event alignment.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge incarceration can flatten cortisol and degrade performance; hair cortisol (pre‑offense segments) and historical records help.
- Over‑interpretation of neuroimaging: fMRI/EEG should not be admitted as determinative; if used at all, limit to corroborative education of the trier of fact with strict Rule 403 policing.
- PCL‑R misuse: avoid using psychopathy scores as a moral proxy; at most, they help distinguish reactive from predatory patterns.
- Sibling “controls”: potentially probative but often prejudicial and logistically fraught; use cautiously in pretrial proffers rather than at trial.

4) Procedural guardrails to keep the gate tight and legitimate
- Pretrial Daubert hearing with a structured proffer tied to the five‑pillar bundle; require standardized documentary proof (health dept BLLs, CPS, school and UI records, housing/EPA orders, geocoded residence history).
- Neutral, court‑appointed experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) alongside party experts; specify the acceptable task battery ex ante (e.g., stop‑signal, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go) and validity measures.
- Offense domain limit: confine to reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Jury instructions: if the gate is passed, use a specialized instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and clarifying that poverty narrative alone is not an excuse; distinguish this excuse from mitigation (and offer MPC §210.3 EED as an alternative in homicide).
- Funding parity: appoint experts and authorize testing for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine is illusory and inequitable.

5) Disposition and error costs
- If the excuse is found, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under judicial supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pathways) with risk controls; reserve civil commitment for those who remain dangerous and meet commitment criteria.
- False‑positive versus false‑negative balance: the bundle and exclusions above bias the system against false positives. The cost is that some truly impaired defendants will be relegated to mitigation—a tradeoff I accept to preserve public legitimacy and victim protection.

In short, Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 elements—when tightened as above—are administrable and probative. Courts should insist on alignment across (1) a reactive event, (2) pre‑offense dyscontrol, (3) validated inhibitory deficits, (4) a diagnostic map to the index offense, and (5) a developmental exposure consistent with mechanism, with intoxication and planning off the table. Anything less belongs at sentencing, not at guilt.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming the court adopts Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage eligibility/attribution framework and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence with disqualifiers, what would your model jury instruction look like to translate this into lay terms? Please draft concise language defining: (i) the defendant’s burden (clear and convincing); (ii) the required elements of the dyscontrol excuse (substantial degradation of inhibitory control and substantial contribution to the act); and (iii) bright‑line exclusions (planned/instrumental conduct, voluntary intoxication). Aim for administrability and juror comprehension, not a treatise.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s bottom line: none of the proposed measures can, alone, time‑stamp a loss of control; what can justify an excuse is tight convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment. If we are to make this administrable and legitimate, I would cabin the doctrine to an automatism‑style “involuntary‑rage” excuse for truly reactive violence, with the remainder of hard cases routed to partial mitigation (MPC extreme emotional disturbance) or sentencing.

Are the tests specific/temporal enough?
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/go‑no‑go; antisaccade; affective Stroop) and stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol; historic blood lead) are, at best, trait‑leaning indices of vulnerability. They are probative of a mechanism but not of what happened at minute X.
- Their probative value rises when: (i) they align with pre‑offense records showing longstanding dyscontrol; and (ii) the index event bears the signature of reflexive aggression and dissociation. They should never be treated as determinative or used to backfill a weak event narrative.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
Require all of the following “core elements,” plus at least two “corroborators.” Failure on any core element defeats the excuse (though it may support mitigation):

Core elements
1) Event signature of automatism‑like rage
- Near‑immediate response to a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous evidence of dissociation (“went blank/seeing red,” flat affect, post‑event confusion), ideally via 911/body‑cam/video or multiple neutral witnesses.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound explosive episodes (school IEP/discipline, juvenile mental‑health notes, ED visits), and sleep disruption/hypervigilance where relevant.

3) Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal SSRT; antisaccade; affective go‑no‑go/affective Stroop) with intact performance‑validity testing; preferably corroborated on a repeat session.

4) Exclusion of obvious alternative drivers
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause; no strong evidence of instrumental motive or calculated planning; no primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; malingering screens negative.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent documentation of at least one: childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or any ≥10), clinically verified early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia, or well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk. This ties executive deficits to plausible etiology.

Corroborators (any two)
- DSM‑5 trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; IED) established with structured instruments, with symptom content mapping to the trigger in the instant event.
- Stress physiology consistent with chronic load (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol, low resting HF‑HRV), recognizing these are supportive, not specific.
- Low–moderate psychopathic traits (PCL‑R not in predatory range), consistent with reactive rather than instrumental aggression.
- Within‑family or peer negative control (e.g., sibling without lead exposure) or geocoded exposure dossier showing the defendant at the top tail of cumulative adversity.

Scientific pitfalls and how courts should manage them
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, or medication changes can depress test performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer replication and pre‑offense records; give more weight to hair cortisol (3‑month window) than single‑day salivary assays.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; look for cross‑task consistency and collateral corroboration; be wary of “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition. Voluntary intoxication should presumptively defeat the excuse; at most, it may be relevant to partial mitigation if a baseline dyscontrol is independently established.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑charge stress can flatten cortisol and worsen testing. Early testing and, more importantly, pre‑charge documentation are key. Give minimal weight to shiny, post hoc imaging; fMRI/EEG should be excluded or admitted only for background education under Rule 403/702 controls.
- Task specificity: WCST/set‑shifting is weakly tied to affective inhibition; downweight it. Favor tasks with clearer inhibitory content and, where possible, affective variants.

Institutional guardrails (to keep this narrow and governable)
- Domain: Limit the complete excuse to truly reactive violent offenses (seconds–minutes after provocation). Planned acquisitive crime is out; most nonviolent offenses default to mitigation, not excuse.
- Burden and procedure: Defense must give notice and carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden. Hold a Rule 702/Daubert hearing on a structured proffer keyed to the elements above. Appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; ensure funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Standardized dossier: Require a court‑ordered compilation of geocoded exposure histories (Area Deprivation Index/tract‑level violence), pediatric/CPS/school/lead/toxin records, housing enforcement, unemployment data—authenticated and admissible.
- Bifurcation and instructions: Use bifurcated proceedings or special interrogatories to avoid guilt‑phase overload. Provide a pattern instruction that defines “substantial impairment of inhibitory control,” links it to the automatism concept (“not the product of the actor’s effort or determination”), and makes clear that voluntary intoxication or planning negates the excuse. Offer MPC‑style EED as a partial alternative in homicide when the full excuse fails.
- Disposition: Where the excuse is found, channel to ESB‑oriented, court‑supervised dispositions (trauma therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, housing relocation, job pathways), with civil commitment reserved for those still demonstrably dangerous.

Bottom line
Treat the science as corroboration of a tightly defined legal construct—automatism‑like reactive rage—not as a roving license to relitigate social history at guilt. If we demand the core triad (event signature, pre‑offense dyscontrol, valid inhibition deficits) plus a documented developmental insult, exclude intoxication and planning, and confine the doctrine to a narrow offense class, the clear‑and‑convincing standard can be met in a small number of cases without opening the floodgates or confounding juries.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing both your appellate and trial‑administration hats: if a jurisdiction were to adopt a tightly cabined RSB‑dyscontrol excuse, what would your black‑letter rule look like? Please sketch (i) the elements the jury must find (including any categorical disqualifiers such as voluntary intoxication or clear planning), (ii) the standard of proof, (iii) the pretrial gatekeeping you’d require (notice, Daubert hearing, neutral experts), and (iv) a short, plain‑English model jury instruction. The aim is administrability and legitimacy—clear enough to constrain floodgates, yet aligned with the mechanistic and event‑level criteria Prof. Santiago and Dr. Chen outlined.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

1) Specificity and temporal fit. None of the listed instruments (stop‑signal, Go/No‑Go, Stroop, WCST) or stress markers (cortisol profiles, historic BLLs) can, standing alone, prove loss of control at the moment of the offense. Properly used as a convergent bundle and anchored to pre‑offense records and the event signature, they can support the Hart/Fletcher inquiry—whether the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply—on a clear‑and‑convincing standard. Courts should treat them as supportive correlates, not time‑stamps.

2) Minimum bundle I would require before the jury hears a dyscontrol excuse
Gatekeeping under Rule 702/Daubert should demand all of the following:

- A. Event‑level signature (contemporaneous, objective)
  - Rapid, affective escalation following a salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of planning/preparation/cover‑up; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam/witness) of “seeing red,” dissociation, autonomic arousal. If there is luring, weapon staging, or other instrumental hallmarks, the proffer fails.

- B. Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
  - Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol: school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, juvenile or medical notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption. This mitigates reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact” concerns.

- C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity safeguards
  - At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact effort indices (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs) and either replication or cross‑test convergence. WCST may be included but should be down‑weighted (set shifting more than inhibition). Low–moderate psychopathy traits to support a reactive, not predatory, profile.

- D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
  - A structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established by a qualified clinician, anchored to exposures documented long before the offense, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger, affective surge, and behavior. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol) is supportive but not required.

- E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
  - Independent, pre‑litigation proof of at least one biologically plausible insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk), plus geocoded exposure/housing records. These do not prove momentary dyscontrol but strengthen causal plausibility when paired with C and D.

And all disqualifiers/controls below:

- Voluntary intoxication proximate to the act defeats the excuse absent persuasive proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of the substance; as a rule, dyscontrol should not ride on self‑induced intoxication.
- Exclude primary psychosis/mania as the driver (different doctrines); exclude acute TBI at the scene.
- Robust malingering checks: multiple validity measures, consistency across sessions, collateral informants.
- Testing conducted promptly (ideally ≤60–90 days) and interpreted in light of sleep, meds, legal stress; rely heavily on pre‑offense records to avoid state–trait confounds.

3) Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress executive performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer replication and pre‑offense documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain. Require multiple PVTs and convergence across tasks; beware selective “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication. Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; do not let intoxication masquerade as RSB dyscontrol.
- Reverse causation. Post‑offense stress can produce the very abnormalities proffered; hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and historic pediatric/educational/health records are key.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect. Neighborhood deprivation and ACEs increase risk but do not attribute causation in a particular case; the event signature and individual testing must carry the weight.
- Over‑interpretation of neuroimages. fMRI/EEG should be admitted, if at all, only as pedagogic support; they are not diagnostic of momentary volitional failure.

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability and equality)

- Pretrial Daubert hearing keyed to a standardized checklist reflecting the bundle above; require defense notice and a structured proffer with documentary exhibits (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA/HUD, UI records; geocoded residence history).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to reduce partisanship; cap the number of retained experts per side to avoid battles of the labs.
- Limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and, rarely, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden: clear and convincing on (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) substantial causal contribution to the instant act.
- Bifurcation and structured verdict. If the defense clears the gate, try guilt first; then a narrowly tailored “reactive dyscontrol” instruction with a special verdict form (specific findings on each pillar). This preserves jury focus and public legitimacy.

5) Disposition

Where the excuse is found, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions with court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, sleep/nutrition, toxin remediation/housing relocation, job pipelines), with civil commitment available only if the person remains demonstrably dangerous. In homicide where the bundle falls short, MPC‑style EED should remain available as partial mitigation.

Bottom line

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 elements are directionally sound if treated as converging, not dispositive, and if filtered through strict gatekeeping and disqualifiers. Adopt a minimum bundle, insist on pre‑offense corroboration and an event‑level signature, and keep intoxication and planning as bright‑line exclusions. Done this way, we honor Hart’s fairness limit without opening floodgates, and we keep the courtroom’s truth‑seeking function aligned with administrability and equal treatment.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your evidence-and-administrability hat, how would you operationalize the gatekeeping around Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage dyscontrol excuse in a way that’s workable for trial courts and juries? Specifically: (i) would you require a pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with a structured checklist (e.g., documented longitudinal deprivation + at least one biological insult + valid inhibition deficits + event‑level “reactive” signature + exclusion of alternatives) under a clear‑and‑convincing standard, and then reserve the ultimate moral judgment for the jury; or would you relocate most of this to sentencing to avoid guilt‑phase complexity; (ii) what model instruction or verdict form would you give to prevent conflating correlation with attribution; and (iii) what safeguards (neutral court‑appointed experts, funding orders for indigent defendants, limits to reactive offenses) are essential to keep this narrow and to minimize error costs and socioeconomic skew?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s answer

Bottom line. None of the Stage 2 tools, standing alone, is specific or time‑precise enough to prove loss of volitional control at the moment of the offense. Used as a convergent bundle, anchored in the event signature and pre‑offense records, they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow slice of reactive‑violence cases. The court’s job is to force alignment among mechanism, history, and moment, and to police common forensic pitfalls.

Are the proposed measures specific/temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive batteries. Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go (SSRT) and antisaccade tasks are the closest fit to inhibitory control. Stroop and WCST are broader executive measures and should be down‑weighted; they add little without a direct inhibition task. All are state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation) and must be backed by performance‑validity tests and, ideally, re‑testing.
- Stress markers. Hair cortisol (3‑month window) gives a better read on chronic load than single‑day salivary profiles, but remains nonspecific. Historic childhood blood‑lead levels are probative of developmental insult to prefrontal control if measured during sensitive windows; they are not time‑stamps of impairment during the offense.
- Clinical diagnosis. Structured assessments (e.g., CAPS‑5 for PTSD, validated IED interviews) can link symptoms to triggers, but diagnosis alone is insufficient without event‑level congruence.
- Translation to the instant offense. None of these tells you “control was lost at 9:17 p.m.” You get there, if at all, by triangulation: a reactive event pattern, pre‑existing dyscontrol, current deficits with validity, and a plausible physiological/trauma pathway, alongside exclusion of better explanations.

Minimum bundle to meet clear and convincing
Require all of the following (“no single pillar suffices, any disqualifier defeats”):

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; seconds/minutes, not hours.
- Disorganized execution; no luring, staging, concealment, or goal‑directed follow‑through.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (witness/body‑cam/911) of “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal, or dissociation.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control or marked affective reactivity (e.g., school discipline/IEPs, juvenile MH notes, ED visits for rage/dissociation, sleep disruption documented by schools/clinics).

3) Neurocognitive evidence tied to inhibition, with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal SSRT, Go‑No‑Go/commission errors, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact effort on multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity indices and either stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive—not predatory—aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in the moderate/high range), used cautiously.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom content and triggers that plausibly explain the index event.
- Supportive physiology (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) is helpful but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated—or ≥10 once; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), predating and plausibly contributing to current deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication proximate to the act defeats the excuse unless the defense shows baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; as a rule, treat substantial voluntary intoxication as disqualifying.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral informants; beware “too bad to be true” or selective impairments.
- Alternative causes excluded: primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time of offense, strong instrumental motive, or clear planning.
- Timing safeguards: testing as early as feasible (within 30–60 days if practicable), plus heavy reliance on pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Scientific/forensic pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss, medication changes, acute legal stress, and incarceration conditions can degrade performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing (sleep, caffeine, meds), consider repeat testing, and prefer pre‑charge documentation.
- Reverse causation. Post‑offense stress can create the very profiles offered as proof; hair cortisol helps, but pre‑offense school/medical records are the strongest antidote.
- Base‑rate errors. Many disadvantaged individuals have high ACEs and even executive weaknesses without committing reactive violence; insist on event‑level congruence and pre‑offense dyscontrol, not merely exposure.
- Malingering/secondary gain. Performance validity is non‑negotiable; require data sharing so court‑appointed experts can re‑score raw tests. Beware expert overreach and “brain‑scan theatrics”; fMRI/EEG should be treated as, at most, supportive.
- IQ/learning effects. Global low ability can depress test scores; ensure impairments are disproportionate in inhibition domains and not explained by generalized cognitive limits alone.
- Intoxication. Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; do not let acute substance effects bootstrap an excuse intended for RSB‑based dyscontrol.
- Cherry‑picking. Guard against post hoc selection of favorable tasks; pre‑specify acceptable test batteries and require disclosure of all administered measures.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and fairness)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to the checklist above; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden on both substantial degradation of inhibitory control and substantial contribution to the act.
- Neutral, court‑appointed experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized documentary proofs (school/CPS/medical/EPA/ housing/UI records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Standardized, pre‑specified test panels and reporting templates; require performance‑validity testing; limit exotic modalities (e.g., fMRI) to corroboration.
- Offense limitation: presumptively confined to reactive violent offenses; planned acquisitive crime excluded.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; without it, the doctrine becomes both hollow and unequal.

From a judge’s perspective, this bundle—event signature + pre‑offense dyscontrol + validated inhibitory deficits + clinical linkage + developmental exposure, plus strict disqualifiers—keeps the gate tight enough to avoid floodgates and respects Hart’s fairness limit without swallowing culpability doctrine. Where the bundle is met, I would channel outcomes to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under supervision, with civil commitment available for those who remain dangerous.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage screen and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as the scientific substrate, how would you translate this into an administrable courtroom gate and a concise jury instruction? Specifically: what would a Daubert-style pretrial proffer have to show (checklist items, burdens, and exclusion grounds) before the jury ever hears RSB dyscontrol, and what brief instruction would you give on “substantial impairment” and causation to keep jurors focused on reactive dyscontrol rather than general hardship? Please be concrete—propose the gate criteria and a model instruction you’d be comfortable issuing.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

Bottom line. None of these instruments can timestamp loss of control. Standing alone they are too nonspecific or too state‑noisy. Used together, and anchored to the event signature and pre‑offense records, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial reactive dyscontrol in a narrow class of cases. The law should demand convergence and exclude common confounds.

What carries probative weight

- Event‑level signature (indispensable)
  - Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; no luring or weapon staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions of “seeing red”/dissociation/autonomic arousal.
  - Corroboration by neutral sources (video, 911/body‑cam, bystander accounts). If planning/goal‑directed conduct appears, the excuse should presumptively fail.

- Pre‑offense documentation (indispensable)
  - Nonforensic records predating the charge (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile MH notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

- Neurocognitive testing (supportive if done right)
  - Require deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks: Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (SSRT), antisaccade, and an affective variant (emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop). Classic Stroop and WCST are too nonspecific to carry the day; downweight or omit WCST.
  - Include multiple performance‑validity tests; repeat or seek cross‑test convergence to mitigate state noise (sleep, meds, effort).

- Clinical linkage (supportive and ordinarily expected)
  - Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom timing and content plausibly map onto the index event; low–moderate psychopathy scores to fit an impulsive rather than predatory profile.

- Objective developmental insult (supportive of mechanism)
  - Independent records of childhood lead exposure (BLL ≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated or a ≥10 spike), documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk. These are not moment‑of‑offense markers but strengthen causal plausibility when paired with executive deficits.

- Stress biology (optional, supportive only)
  - Hair cortisol (3‑month window) or low resting HF‑HRV can support chronic stress/dysregulation; single‑day salivary diurnal cortisol is too noisy. No fMRI; whatever its scientific interest, its prejudicial effect outweighs modest probative value in individual attribution.

Minimum convergence to meet clear‑and‑convincing

I would require all of the following:
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol, corroborated; and
2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol; and
3) Neurocognitive evidence as above with intact effort validity; and
4) A structured clinical diagnosis that plausibly explains the event;

plus at least one of:
5) An objective developmental exposure marker consistent with mechanism; or
6) A stress biology marker consistent with chronic dysregulation.

And the following exclusions:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause (substantial alcohol/drug effects defeat the excuse; trivial levels do not).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at offense.
- Strong instrumental motives, luring, or concealment.
- Malingering (failures on PVTs, “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” patterns).

Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, legal stress can depress task performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer repeated/triangulated results and pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; scrutinize selective impairments on easy‑to‑fake tasks.
- Acute intoxication: separates excuse from mitigation; ensure toxicology and contemporaneous observations are in the record.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑offense incarceration stress can alter physiology and cognition. Weight pre‑charge records heavily; use hair cortisol for pre‑offense windows; be cautious with post‑charge first‑time diagnoses.
- Over‑interpretation of nonspecific tests (WCST, classic Stroop) and overreliance on glossy neuroscience (fMRI).

Procedural guardrails (administrability)

- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above; appoint neutral court experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Early notice; standardized templates for documentary proof; government right to independent examination (with funding parity for indigent defendants).
- Limit the doctrine to reactive violence (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Special verdict interrogatories (e.g., findings on event signature, pre‑offense history, test deficits with validity, diagnosis linkage, exclusion of intoxication) and a tailored instruction: anger or hardship alone is insufficient; the question is substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time.

With these refinements, Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is workable for a very small subset of cases and consistent with Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply—while preserving jury focus and public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and legitimacy perspective, if a court were to adopt the Santiago/Chen dyscontrol framework, what precise guardrails would you put in place at admissibility and at the jury-charge stage? Please specify: (i) Daubert-style criteria you would require for the neurocognitive and biological evidence (what gets in, what is downweighted or excluded, how to handle malingering/intoxication); and (ii) a concise model jury instruction (including burden—clear and convincing?—and the narrow offense domain) that directs jurors on how to evaluate convergence, event signature, and alternative-cause exclusion without inviting nullification or cultural stereotyping.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment and proposed gatekeeping standard

Bottom line. The lab tools Prof. Santiago lists (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, Stroop, WCST; hair/diurnal cortisol; historic BLLs) are not time‑stamps of control failure. They can corroborate a mechanistic story, but the fulcrum for any dyscontrol excuse must be contemporaneous event evidence and pre‑offense documentation. Used in a convergent, pre‑specified bundle, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment in a narrow class of reactive cases. Used piecemeal, they risk overreach.

Specificity and temporal sensitivity

- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑signal (SSRT), Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, and affective interference tasks are the most relevant to inhibition/affect regulation. They are moderately sensitive to trait dyscontrol but are state‑noisy (sleep, meds, motivation) and not offense‑moment specific. WCST is least specific; I would downweight or omit it.
- Stress/exposure markers: Hair cortisol is a better chronic stress index than single‑day saliva; still nonspecific. Historic childhood BLLs (especially repeated ≥5 µg/dL or any ≥10 µg/dL) increase mechanistic plausibility for prefrontal dyscontrol but say nothing about the moment. Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition are similarly background‑probative.
- Brain imaging: fMRI/EEG add little for adjudication; high risk of “neuro‑theater.” Admit, if at all, only as supportive and only under strict Rule 702/Daubert scrutiny.

Minimum converging bundle I would require (clear and convincing; all five pillars; no single item sufficient)

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol (core, indispensable)
- Acute provocation followed by seconds/minutes to action; absence of advance planning, weapon staging, or concealment; disorganized execution.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam or multiple consistent witnesses) of dissociation/autonomic arousal (“went blank,” trembling, tachycardia, tunnel vision); brief duration; rapid abatement.
- If the record shows luring, preparation, or calm post‑event instrumental behavior, the excuse should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense history of episodic dyscontrol (nonforensic)
- School/juvenile/medical/CPS records predating the offense documenting explosive reactivity, dissociative episodes, or impulse‑control problems (IEPs, suspensions for reactive aggression, ED visits), sleep disruption tied to environmental stressors. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity and appropriate norms
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal; errors on Go–No‑Go/antisaccade; affective Stroop/Go–No‑Go), replicated or cross‑validated; include delay‑discounting if available.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) intact; norms matched for age, education, language, and culture. Markedly elevated psychopathic traits should undercut a “reactive” account.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger, dissociation, and rapid time course of the index event.
- Supportive physiological indices (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol; low resting HF‑HRV) may be admitted as corroboration but are not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑offense documentation of at least one biologically plausible insult (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia; credible FASD risk), or substantiated severe early trauma (CPS, caregiver incarceration) of the kind known to degrade control systems.

Mandatory exclusions and controls

- Voluntary intoxication proximate to the offense defeats the excuse absent persuasive evidence of baseline dyscontrol sufficient to meet the standard independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless pursuing an insanity pathway), acute TBI, and malingering (multiple PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral informants).
- Testing timing and standardization: conduct as early as practicable (ideally within 30–60 days), standardize for sleep/medication/caffeine, and, where feasible, repeat or corroborate with pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, pain, and medication changes can depress executive performance and flatten cortisol. Require standardized conditions, repeat testing, and reliance on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use a battery of validity measures; be wary of selective, “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” impairments.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; the doctrine should not become an intoxication end‑run.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑charge stress can mimic chronic stress signatures; hair cortisol helps with pre‑offense windows; the safest anchor is historical documentation.
- Over‑interpretation/“neuromania”: Heavily discount glossy imaging; insist on methods with known error rates, peer review, and general acceptance (Daubert).
- Norms and cultural/linguistic fit: Ensure neuropsych norms and instruments are appropriate for the defendant’s education and language; otherwise, false positives rise.
- Base‑rate and ecological fallacy: High adversity is common; the question is whether this defendant’s impairments, not population averages, substantially degraded control in this event.

Procedural guardrails (to keep the gate tight and equitable)

- Structured proffer and Rule 702/Daubert hearing keyed to the five pillars; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) under Evidence Rule 706.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA, employment; geocoded histories).
- Offense limitation: confine to reactive violent offenses (and, rarely, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden: defense must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, both (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.

Doctrinal channeling and disposition

- Use this Stage‑2 showing to support only a tightly cabined involuntary‑rage/automatism‑type excuse. Where the showing is weaker or the case is homicide with significant provocation, channel to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance for mitigation, not exculpation. In all other cases, RSB belongs at sentencing.
- If excused, employ bifurcation and specialized instructions to preserve jury focus, and provide for ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions or, where appropriate, civil commitment under existing dangerousness standards. Absent statutory authority, courts should not improvise broad preventive detention for excused defendants.

This approach aligns the science with Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply—while giving trial courts administrable criteria and juries a disciplined framework that resists both over‑ and under‑inclusion.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume the court recognizes a dyscontrol-based RSB excuse with Prof. Santiago’s Stage 1/Stage 2 framework and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle. As a gatekeeper, precisely what Daubert/Frye admissibility rulings would you make ex ante: which proposed measures would you routinely admit (e.g., SSRT/Go–No-Go with PVTs, childhood BLL records), which would you exclude or tightly cabin (e.g., WCST, fMRI, single-day salivary cortisol, hair cortisol), and how would you structure the pretrial hearing (burden, neutral experts, proffers) to prevent a mini-trial and control error costs? Please be concrete about standards and limiting instructions.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you, Chair. I’ll translate Dr. Chen’s science into administrable courtroom gates, consistent with a narrow, rule‑governed dyscontrol excuse. The touchstone remains Hart’s fairness limit: no punishment where the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform at the moment of offense. To keep error costs tolerable, the attribution showing must be tight, offense‑limited, and built on pre‑offense documentation, not post‑charge artifacts.

1) Offense domain and burden
- Domain: reactive interpersonal violence only (rapid escalation after a salient provocation). Presumptive exclusion for planned acquisitive crimes and predatory violence.
- Burden: clear and convincing evidence that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of offense and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause.
- Disqualifiers: substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver; instrumental planning (luring, staging, concealment); primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; credible malingering.

2) Stage 2 minimum bundle (all five pillars required)
No single metric time‑stamps volitional failure. I would require convergence across five pillars, with independent, pre‑offense anchors wherever possible:

A. Event signature (contemporaneous, objective)
- Near‑immediate escalation; disorganized execution; absence of planning/cover‑up.
- Corroboration via 911 audio/bodycam/video or neutral witness accounts describing “seeing red,” dissociation, autonomic arousal.
- Any evidence of luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental behavior defeats this pillar.

B. Pre‑offense history of dyscontrol (nonforensic records)
- School/IEP or juvenile records showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control; prior ED visits or documented episodes of explosive reactivity/dissociation; sleep disruption patterns. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation worries.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity checks
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks tightly linked to the mechanism (e.g., Stop‑Signal Reaction Time; Antisaccade; affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), administered with multiple performance‑validity tests and standardized conditions; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Trait screen consistent with impulsive/reactive (not predatory) aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in the moderate–high range), used cautiously.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger–response pattern; anchored to exposures documented long before the offense.
- Stress physiology is supportive, not dispositive: hair cortisol (flattened 3‑month profile) preferred over single‑day salivary measures; low resting HF‑HRV may support affect‑regulation impairment.

E. Objective developmental exposure biomarker (mechanistic plausibility)
- At least one litigationally independent biological insult consistent with prefrontal/affect‑regulation compromise, predating the offense: childhood BLLs (ideally repeated ≥5 µg/dL or any ≥10 µg/dL); documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; credible FASD risk; or verified severe sleep/crowding exposures with collateral records. These do not prove momentary loss of control but, paired with C and D, supply causative plausibility.

3) Evidentiary exclusions and cautions
- Neuroimaging: exclude fMRI at guilt; it lacks individual‑level diagnostic specificity and invites over‑interpretation. EEG and autonomic measures may be admitted as supportive only.
- Cortisol: prefer hair cortisol; single‑day salivary profiles are too noisy for attribution.
- WCST: downweight; set‑shifting is less specific to inhibitory dyscontrol. Keep any battery lean and mechanism‑relevant.
- Intoxication: voluntary intoxication generally defeats the excuse; if present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Malingering/state–trait confounds: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; standardize testing (sleep, caffeine, meds); where feasible, repeat to confirm stability; lean heavily on pre‑offense records.

4) Procedure and gatekeeping
- Notice and structured proffer: defense files a checklist‑tied proffer (the five pillars) with documentary exhibits (medical labs, school/CPS, housing/EPA, geocoded history).
- Daubert/Kumho hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health. No jury hears RSB evidence unless the bench finds all five pillars prima facie satisfied and no disqualifier triggered.
- Bifurcation and instructions: if admitted, use a specialized instruction emphasizing that deprivation evidence is received solely to decide whether the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform at the time of the act; it is not a license for sympathy nullification.
- Special interrogatories: require the jury to answer targeted questions (e.g., reactive event signature; presence of substantial voluntary intoxication; substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time; causal contribution).

5) Disposition
- If excused: ESB‑oriented noncarceral dispositions with tight supervision—trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic blocks, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports; victims’ input and safety conditions; civil commitment only where ongoing dangerousness is shown.
- If the gate is not met: RSB remains available as structured mitigation at sentencing under validated indicators (e.g., verified lead exposure; chronic unemployment/housing instability; ACEs with CPS corroboration).

Why this remains narrow
Requiring all five pillars—event‑level signature, pre‑offense dyscontrol, valid inhibition deficits, a diagnosis that maps to the event, and at least one objective developmental exposure—plus disqualifiers and neutral‑expert gatekeeping, will confine the excuse to a small class of truly reactive cases where mechanism and moment align. That preserves public legitimacy and victim respect while honoring Hart’s fairness limit.

Finally, two practical cautions for courts:
- Beware “forensic creations”: post‑charge testing and narratives untethered to pre‑offense life records. Weight contemporaneous, neutral documentation.
- Calibrate error costs at guilt: where doubt remains about momentary loss of control, route the equities to sentencing mitigation rather than acquittal.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you sketch an administrability blueprint that makes Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑1/Stage‑2 gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence workable in court? Specifically: (1) outline a pretrial protocol (notice, Daubert‑style hearing, neutral court‑appointed experts, documentary thresholds, and an offense‑domain cap) you would adopt; and (2) draft a short model jury instruction defining “reactive dyscontrol” and “substantial degradation of inhibitory control,” clarifying burdens (State on elements; defendant clear‑and‑convincing on excuse), the role of deprivation evidence (not a defense per se), and disqualifiers (voluntary intoxication, planning). If you’d exclude particular evidence as more prejudicial than probative (e.g., unvalidated fMRI, post‑offense self‑reports without corroboration), please say so and why, and add any funding safeguards to avoid wealth‑based disparities in presenting this defense.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate, but courts should treat Stage 2 tools as corroborative, not dispositive. None of the tests or biomarkers time‑stamp loss of control; they can, at best, make a reactive dyscontrol account highly probable when they line up with the event itself and with pre‑offense history. To keep this governable, I would channel the doctrine as follows:

1) Where it fits, use existing boxes
- Homicide: route into MPC §210.3 extreme emotional disturbance with a “person in the actor’s situation” instruction.
- Non‑homicide, reactive violence with credible dissociation: treat as an involuntary‑act/automatism excuse.
- Everything else (including planned acquisitive offenses): RSB belongs at sentencing.

2) Threshold showing and burden
- Notice and proffer at least 60 days pretrial.
- Daubert‑style hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.

3) Minimum convergence required at Stage 2 (all five pillars)
- Event signature: Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; credible contemporaneous observations of “seeing red,” blanking out, marked autonomic arousal. If there is planning or post‑event instrumental behavior, the excuse presumptively fails.
- Pre‑offense dyscontrol: Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile or ED notes documenting dissociation/IED, sleep disruption) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control. This answers temporality and reduces reverse‑causation risk.
- Neurocognitive profile with validity: Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go SSRT and an affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests intact and stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Add antisaccade or flanker as available. Low–moderate psychopathy/trait aggression to support an impulsive (not predatory) profile.
- Psychiatric linkage: A structured‑interview diagnosis tied to documented exposures (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom content plausibly maps to the index event; biological stress corroboration (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.
- Objective exposure biomarker: At least one developmental biological insult documented independent of litigation (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥10 µg/dL once or ≥5 on repeated measures; early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk), cohering with the measured executive deficits.

4) Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls
- Voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Exclude primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the event, and clear instrumental motives.
- Guard against malingering with multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity indices; watch for “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Standardize and, where feasible, repeat testing; rely on pre‑charge records to offset jail‑induced state changes.

5) Scientific cautions for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, pain, and legal stress can depress test performance and flatten cortisol; require standardized conditions and triangulation.
- Reverse causation: incarceration and post‑event stress alter physiology; use pre‑offense records and, if possible, hair cortisol covering the pre‑offense window.
- Over‑interpretation: fMRI/EEG are not event‑level lie detectors; admit only, if at all, as low‑weight corroboration alongside stronger pillars.
- WCST is nonspecific; downweight it relative to inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks.

6) Offense domain and floodgates
- Confine to reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- With the five‑pillar convergence, neutral experts, and a clear‑and‑convincing burden, only a small fraction will reach juries; fewer will succeed.

7) Jury instruction sketch (for automatism/dyscontrol)
- “The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant’s act was the product of a conscious exercise of will. The defendant claims that, due to cumulative environmental deprivation and an acute provocation, he acted in an involuntary dissociative state. If you find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant’s capacity to inhibit action was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act, and if the State has not proved a voluntary act beyond a reasonable doubt, you must find the defendant not guilty of offenses requiring a voluntary act.”

8) Disposition
- Special verdict triggers immediate civil‑commitment screening for those who remain dangerous; otherwise, ESB‑oriented noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused therapy, stable housing away from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, education/job placement), with robust victim input and risk‑based supervision.

This framework respects Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply—while preserving administrability and public legitimacy. It also avoids importing “societal fault” apportionment into guilt, which I view as incoherent in criminal adjudication; the right place for broader deprivation is structured mitigation at sentencing.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s convergence standard as the scientific floor, can you sketch a model jury instruction for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse that is both strict and comprehensible? Please specify: (i) the definition of “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense”; (ii) the burden and standard of proof; (iii) the required causal nexus language (e.g., “a substantial contributing cause”); (iv) explicit disqualifiers (planning, voluntary intoxication, malingering); and (v) whether to use special verdict questions or bifurcation. Aim for 150–200 words of instruction text, plus any notes to the court on procedure.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s perspective

I largely agree with Dr. Chen: none of the proposed tools can time‑stamp loss of control; they are corroborative, not determinative. If courts are to admit Stage‑2 evidence, they should do so under a tight, rule‑governed gate with clear burdens and disqualifiers, and juries must be instructed on the limits.

Gatekeeping and burden

- Procedural posture: pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing; defendant bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden on all prongs; court may appoint neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Offense domain: presumptively limited to reactive interpersonal violence; exclude planned acquisitive crime and organized retaliatory acts.
- Disqualifiers (any one defeats the excuse): substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; evidence of planning/weapon staging/luring/cover‑up; credible instrumental motive; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; malingering (failed PVTs).

Minimum converging bundle (all five)

1) Event signature (moment)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; contemporaneous evidence (911/body‑cam/witness) of dissociation or marked autonomic arousal; no concealment.

2) Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound rage/dyscontrol (school IEP/discipline, juvenile MH notes, ED visits, documented sleep disruption). This guards against reverse‑causation and forensic artifact.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity (mechanism)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop/Go‑No‑Go), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and reasonable stability across sessions; low‑to‑moderate psychopathy traits (supporting reactive, not predatory, aggression).

4) Clinical linkage (phenomenology)
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom triggers plausibly map onto the index event; biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) may support but is not required.

5) Objective exposure biomarker (plausibility)
- At least one developmental insult documented independent of litigation (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or one ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), consistent with the executive deficits found.

Scientific cautions for courts

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, and incarceration stress depress performance and cortisol; standardize testing, repeat where feasible, and anchor to pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity indices; be wary of selective, “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; treat voluntary intoxication as defeating the excuse unless the record shows baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge stress alters biomarkers; prefer pre‑charge medical/educational/environmental records; hair cortisol can offer a pre‑offense window.
- Neuro “glow”: fMRI/EEG are low‑specificity at the individual level; admit, if at all, only as supportive, with limiting instructions; consider Rule 403 exclusion if undue prejudice outweighs probative value.
- Norms and equity: use demographically adjusted test norms to avoid over‑pathologizing; ensure indigent defendants have funded access or the doctrine will be applied unevenly.

Jury instructions (specialized)

- Tell jurors the tests do not prove loss of control at a precise moment; they are one piece of corroboration.
- The question is whether, at the time of the act, defendant’s capacity to inhibit was substantially degraded and that degradation was a substantial factor causing the act—not merely that he lives with general impairments.

Disposition

- If excused, prefer ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment support) with supervision; use civil commitment only if statutory dangerousness is met. This preserves public safety and legitimacy without converting the excuse into open‑ended preventive detention.

Bottom line

Stage‑2 can support a dyscontrol excuse only when mechanism, history, and moment align. Requiring all five pillars above, plus the disqualifiers, keeps the doctrine narrow enough to satisfy Hart’s fairness limit while avoiding the floodgates and expressive harms Prof. Watkins and Ms. Whitford fear.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions as givens, what concrete procedural architecture would you adopt to keep this administrable and error‑controlled? Specifically: (i) would you require a pretrial Rule 104/Daubert‑style hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts and a clear‑and‑convincing burden; (ii) what categorical disqualifiers (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, evidence of planning, high psychopathic traits, malingering flags) should be codified; and (iii) could you sketch a brief model jury instruction that focuses jurors on “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of offense” without inviting a free‑ranging social justice seminar? Feel free to note bifurcation, verdict forms, and how you’d communicate ESB‑type dispositions to address victim‑safety concerns.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I find Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 architecture directionally sound and Dr. Chen’s cautions exactly right: none of the proposed measures time‑stamps loss of control; the only way this can be administered without losing public legitimacy is to demand tight convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment, and to keep the domain narrow (reactive violence, not instrumental offending).

From a court’s perspective, here is how I would translate Stage 2 into a legally workable gate and burden.

1) Gatekeeping framework
- Pretrial hearing under Rule 702/Daubert. Defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden on both elements: (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control; and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the charged act.
- Neutral experts. Court‑appointed neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health experts to review raw data and methods; no reliance on glossy summaries.
- Standardized proffer. A checklist with required records (medical labs, school/IEP, CPS, housing/EPA/HUD, UI, geocoded residence history), test protocols, validity indices, and toxicology.

2) Minimum convergence required (no single item sufficient)
I would require all five pillars below, plus the disqualifiers, to meet clear‑and‑convincing:

A. Event signature (moment)
- Rapid escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized, unplanned execution; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam or multiple witnesses) of “went blank/seeing red,” autonomic arousal, or dissociation.
- Negative indicia: no luring, weapon staging, concealment, or other planning; minimal post‑offense instrumental behavior.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, prior ED or clinic notes for rage/dissociation, documented sleep disruption). This is the best protection against reverse‑causation artifacts.

C. Neurocognitive profile (mechanism), with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below age‑norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), administered under standardized conditions, with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and, ideally, cross‑session stability.
- Trait profile consistent with reactive (not predatory) aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in the moderate–high range), used cautiously.

D. Psychiatric linkage (diagnosis maps to event)
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to pre‑existing exposures and explaining the index trigger/symptoms. Physiological corroboration (e.g., flattened hair/salivary diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective exposure biomarker (developmental insult)
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one relevant biological insult during sensitive periods (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), which plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

Required disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication. Substantial alcohol/drug intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering safeguards. Multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity and symptom‑validity measures, consistency across sessions, and collateral informants.
- Alternative causes excluded. Primary psychosis/mania (unless a different doctrine is at issue), acute TBI at the time of offense, or clear instrumental motive.
- Testing timing/conditions. Early testing (ideally within 30–60 days), with standardized sleep/medication conditions or corroboration; heavy weight on pre‑offense records to avoid forensic artifact.

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss, withdrawal, legal stress, or meds can depress performance and flatten cortisol; require standardized protocols and, where feasible, repeat or triangulate.
- Malingering/secondary gain. Look for “too bad to be true” selective deficits; insist on raw data and validity indices; beware of coached dissociation narratives.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers. Historic BLLs speak to developmental risk, not moment‑to‑moment control; cortisol profiles are noisy. Treat fMRI/EEG as, at most, supportive; they are not specific.
- Ecological fallacy. Neighborhood or school deprivation is not a license; it matters only insofar as it helps explain measured, individual impairments tied to the event.
- PCL‑R misuse. Avoid turning trait measures into outcome determiners; they inform the impulsive vs predatory distinction but cannot carry causation.

4) Offense domain and doctrinal placement
- Limit to reactive violent offenses (e.g., sudden homicides/assaults). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Map to existing doctrines to preserve coherence:
  - Automatism/involuntary‑act (the “involuntary‑rage” strand) in the rare case where evidence supports dissociative, nonvolitional behavior.
  - MPC‑style EED in homicide for imperfect mitigation when control was markedly degraded but not abolished.
  - Otherwise, route RSB to sentencing mitigation with ESB‑oriented conditions.
- Bifurcate. Try guilt first; if a dyscontrol excuse is to be considered, use a specialized phase with focused instructions on “substantial impairment of inhibitory control such that the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform.”

5) Jury instructions (plain terms)
- The question is not whether the defendant grew up deprived or was angry; it is whether, at the time of the act, his/her ability to stop himself/herself was so substantially impaired—by documented, pre‑existing conditions—that he/she lacked a fair opportunity to comply with the law.
- The defense fails if you find planning, instrumental motive, or that voluntary intoxication was the real driver.

6) Disposition
- If excuse succeeds: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation away from criminogenic stressors, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports), with civil commitment available if the person remains demonstrably dangerous.
- If the showing falls short: structured mitigation at sentencing keyed to verified deprivation indicators and ESB conditions.

Bottom line
The proposed batteries and markers, used as a bundle and tied to event‑level facts and pre‑offense records, can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment in a narrow band of cases. The court’s job is to keep the gate tight—neutral expertise, standardized proofs, narrow offense scope, and disqualifiers—so we honor Hart’s fairness limit without inviting a regime of ad hoc excusing. In close cases, the system maintains legitimacy by reserving full exculpation for the truly nonvolitional and channeling the rest to principled mitigation.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle and disqualifiers as the scientific backbone, could you draft a concise model jury instruction and a special verdict form for a narrowly tailored dyscontrol excuse? Please specify: (i) the elements the defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence (substantial degradation of inhibitory control and substantial causal contribution to the instant act); (ii) how the instruction should direct jurors to weigh event‑level indicators (reactive, disorganized, no planning) versus neurocognitive/biomarker evidence and pre‑offense records; and (iii) categorical disqualifiers (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, strong evidence of instrumental planning, malingering). If you think bifurcation is essential, note where in the trial these issues should be decided.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thanks, Chair. From a judge’s evidentiary and administrability lens, Professor Santiago’s Stage 2 attribution moves in the right direction: it demands convergence across mechanism, history, and the index event, rather than letting any single test carry causation. But none of the proposed instruments is, standing alone, specific or time‑precise enough to prove loss of inhibitory control at the moment of offense. If courts adopt a dyscontrol excuse, the gate must be narrow and rule‑governed.

1) Are the proposed tools specific and temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive batteries
  - Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go: best available proxies for motor inhibition; still state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation) and not time‑stamped to the offense.
  - Affective variants (emotional Go‑No‑Go/Stroop; antisaccade) are better aligned with reactive aggression than WCST, which I would downweight as nonspecific set‑shifting.
  - Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) are indispensable; single‑session results are weak—repeat or cross‑test convergence is preferable.
- Stress/exposure markers
  - Hair cortisol gives a 2–3 month window of chronic load; single‑day salivary profiles are too noisy. Even so, these indices are supportive, not determinative.
  - Historic childhood blood lead (BLL) elevations or documented fetal alcohol exposure meaningfully increase biological plausibility when paired with inhibition deficits; they do not prove momentary dyscontrol.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition records are corroborative only.
- Bottom line: these measures can support an inference of substantial volitional degradation when they align with a reactive event signature and pre‑offense documentation. They cannot by themselves time‑stamp control failure.

2) Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)
Require all of A–C and at least one item from D and E; failure on any disqualifier defeats the excuse.

A. Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/staging/cover‑up; contemporaneous corroboration (911/body‑cam/witnesses) of “seeing red,” dissociation, autonomic arousal. Any credible planning or instrumental motive presumptively defeats the excuse.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (non‑forensic)
- School/juvenile or medical records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound explosive reactivity, dissociation, or impulse‑control problems; sleep disruption documentation if relevant.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact and multiple PVTs and either repeated testing or cross‑task convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive (not predatory) aggression; use PCL‑R cautiously (known bias/overreach); alternative trait measures acceptable.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to pre‑offense exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response pattern; chronic stress marker (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental biological insult
- Independent records of a plausible insult (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, or single ≥10; well‑documented FASD risk; clinically verified early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia), temporally preceding and plausibly contributing to current executive deficits.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one defeats the claim)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver.
- Primary psychosis/mania at offense not traceable to the RSB exposures (that is a different doctrine).
- Malingering/secondary gain (failed validity tests; “too bad to be true” patterns; inconsistency across sessions).
- Clear evidence of calculated, instrumental behavior (luring, weapon staging, concealment, retaliatory planning).

3) Scientific pitfalls courts must police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, withdrawal, meds, pain, and legal stress depress performance and cortisol. Standardize conditions; prefer repeated testing; lean on pre‑charge records to anchor trait.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑arrest stress can flatten cortisol and degrade cognition; hair cortisol covering the pre‑offense window and historical medical/educational records mitigate this.
- Malingering/coaching: Use multiple PVTs across modalities; scrutinize selective impairments on easy‑to‑feign tasks.
- Acute intoxication: Distinguish developmental toxin history (lead/FASD) from proximate alcohol/drug effects; the latter should generally bar the excuse.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: fMRI/EEG are not courtroom lie‑detectors; admit, if at all, as low‑weight, supportive context under strict Rule 702/Daubert limits.

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability and equality)
- Pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing keyed to a standardized proffer template covering A–E above; require defense to meet a clear‑and‑convincing burden on “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause.”
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); standardized test batteries and conditions; funding parity for indigent defendants to avoid a doctrine usable only by the well‑resourced.
- Offense‑domain limits: confine to reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts). For homicides that fall short of automatism‑like collapse, channel to MPC‑style EED rather than full excuse.
- Jury instruction safeguards: make plain that poverty or adversity alone is not an excuse; the question is whether, at the moment, inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that degradation substantially caused the act.

5) Disposition
- Where the excuse is found, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused treatment, safe housing, nutrition/sleep restoration, employment pathways) with risk management; civil commitment only if statutory criteria are met. Where the showing is partial or planning intrudes, prefer mitigation or MPC §210.3 instructions over acquittal.

In short: the Stage 2 elements can support a dyscontrol inference if—and only if—they converge with a reactive event signature and pre‑offense records, and if the court polices the well‑known scientific pitfalls. Even then, this should be rare. Anything less threatens both administrability and the fairness limit Hart and Fletcher anchor in “fair opportunity to comply,” as well as the public’s sense that the courtroom is not a forum for excusing poverty but for adjudicating culpability.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, from an administrability and error‑cost perspective, do Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle strike you as something trial courts and juries can actually implement without devolving into satellite litigation? If you were drafting a model pretrial (Daubert‑style) admissibility order and a short-form jury instruction, what would they say—burden (clear and convincing?), offense domain (reactive violence only), required categories of proof, and categorical exclusions (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, evidence of planning)? Please be concrete about the checklist you’d require at the admissibility hearing, how to avoid “bad‑upbringing” creep in the guilt phase, and what safeguards (court‑appointed neutral experts, funding parity) you’d insist on to keep outcomes even‑handed and appeal‑proof.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I largely agree with Dr. Chen’s bottom line: none of these instruments can time‑stamp loss of control; they earn their keep only as part of a convergent bundle tied to the event. From a court’s administrability and error‑cost perspective, I would tighten Stage 2 to a small set of “must haves,” make some tools strictly supportive, and hard‑code disqualifiers. I would also confine the excuse to reactive violence with true immediacy; border cases should be channeled to MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or to sentencing mitigation.

1) What the tests can and cannot do
- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (SSRT) and antisaccade tasks: acceptable proxies for inhibitory control; moderate specificity; sensitive to state noise. Usable with performance‑validity checks and, ideally, replication.
- Affective inhibition tasks (emotional Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop): add mechanism plausibility in anger‑triggered events; again, not dispositive.
- Classic Stroop/WCST: too nonspecific; admit only as ancillary.
- Diurnal cortisol: hair cortisol (3‑month window) > single‑day saliva; supportive of chronic load but not specific nor proximate.
- Historic blood lead (BLL): probative of developmental insult if elevations occurred in early childhood; it is historical, not event‑proximal.
- Neuroimaging (fMRI/EEG): high Rule 403 risk; at most corroborative, rarely worth the prejudice and complexity.

2) Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
All five pillars should be present; no single item suffices:

A. Event signature (contemporaneous and objective)
- Acute, salient provocation; seconds‑to‑minutes escalation; disorganized, non‑instrumental act; no luring, staging, or concealment. Prefer video/911/body‑cam or multiple neutral witnesses. Bright‑line exclusions: weapon retrieval after a meaningful pause, leaving and returning, pursuit over distance, post‑event cleanup.

B. Pre‑offense dyscontrol documentation
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound rages/dissociation or impulse‑control failures (school IEP/discipline, pediatric/ED notes, juvenile files, prior sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and affective Go–No‑Go/antisaccade), replicated or convergent across sessions; multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs intact. Include a choice‑impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available. Avoid overreliance on PCL‑R; if used, only to rule out high predatory traits.

D. Clinical linkage that maps to the offense
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified examiner, anchored to pre‑existing exposures; symptom content plausibly explains index trigger/phenomenology. Biological stress markers (hair cortisol) supportive, not essential.

E. Objective developmental insult
- At least one independently documented biological insult consistent with the mechanism (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a prior ≥10; early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk). This is not required to be proximate, but it strengthens causal plausibility when paired with C and D.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; baseline dyscontrol cannot be proven through an intoxicated event.
- Malingering: fail any of several PVTs or show “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” patterns → exclude.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB mechanism, acute TBI at offense, or strong instrumental motives → exclude.
- Testing latency: conduct early (30–60 days) where feasible; give pre‑offense records significant weight to avoid forensic artifact.

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: sleep loss, acute stress, meds can depress performance and cortisol. Standardize conditions; where possible, repeat testing or corroborate with pre‑offense data.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress flattens cortisol and degrades cognition; hair cortisol helps but is imperfect. Pre‑charge documentation is the best antidote.
- Over‑interpretation: treat all biomarkers as probabilistic; resist “brain made me do it” narratives.
- PCL‑R misuse: high prejudice, limited incremental value in this context; if used, employ with caution and limiting instruction.

4) Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing with a structured checklist tied to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; limit offense domain to reactive violent crimes; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive offenses.
- Bifurcation and specialized instructions: jury first finds the elements; if reached, a separate phase on dyscontrol with instructions emphasizing (i) immediacy, (ii) absence of planning, (iii) need for convergence, and (iv) that poverty alone is not an excuse. Provide a fallback instruction on MPC §210.3 EED in homicide when the excuse fails but mitigation is warranted.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will operate inequitably.

5) Disposition
- If excuse found: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision with trauma‑focused care, housing/sleep/nutrition stabilization, removal from criminogenic settings; civil commitment reserved for demonstrably dangerous, mentally ill defendants. Victim input and protective conditions should be built in.

Why this stays narrow
Requiring (i) a true reactive event signature, (ii) pre‑offense dyscontrol records, (iii) valid inhibitory deficits, (iv) a diagnosis that maps to the moment, and (v) an objective developmental insult—plus strict exclusions—will confine the excuse to a very small, defensible subset. Borderline or planned cases should go to EED (homicide) or structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators. This preserves legitimacy, respects victims, and honors Hart’s fairness limit without inviting floodgates.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, could you sketch the operative doctrinal test and a short pattern jury instruction for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse that incorporates Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑1/Stage‑2 framework and Dr. Chen’s cautions? Please specify: (i) the elements the jury must find (e.g., substantial impairment of inhibitory control and causation to the instant act); (ii) explicit disqualifiers (planning, voluntary intoxication, malingering); (iii) the burden and standard of proof; and (iv) whether you would channel this through a pretrial Daubert‑style gatekeeping hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts. Keep it tight enough that trial judges can apply it consistently and explain why your wording minimizes floodgates and respects victims.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

Big picture. I agree with Dr. Chen: none of these instruments time‑stamps volitional failure. They are, at best, trait‑leaning proxies that become probative when they line up with (a) a documented exposure history and (b) an event that looks like reactive dyscontrol rather than instrumental crime. In evidentiary terms, their probative value depends on convergence; singly they invite 403 problems.

Specificity and temporal sensitivity

- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) index inhibitory control under lab conditions. They are not specific to RSB and are state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, effort). Use them as corroboration of a mechanism, not as “moment of offense” proof.
- WCST/set‑shifting adds little to the volitional question; I would downweight it.
- Diurnal or hair cortisol, resting HRV: supportive of chronic stress physiology; neither is specific or temporally tied to the offense window.
- Historic blood lead (childhood BLLs) and documented malnutrition/IDA are developmentally relevant insults; their value lies in explaining enduring prefrontal control weaknesses, not acute impairment.

Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard

I would require all of the following, with the defense bearing the burden:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Affective, precipitous escalation within minutes of a salient provocation; absence of planning or concealment; disorganized execution; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/bodycam/witnesses) of “blanking out,” marked autonomic arousal, or confusion. Evidence of luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental behavior should presumptively defeat the claim.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school discipline/IEPs for explosive outbursts, juvenile mental‑health notes, ED visits for rage/dissociation, documented sleep disruption) establishing temporality and reducing post‑charge artifact concerns.

3) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one developmental biological insult independently documented: childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or ≥10 once), credible FASD risk, or pediatric records of iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; coupled with the longitudinal deprivation profile from Stage 1 (neighborhood ADI/ICE, school finance, housing instability), already proposed by Prof. Santiago.

4) Neurocognitive profile with validity and affective content
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time and an affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus an eye‑movement inhibition task (antisaccade) if available; intact effort on multiple performance‑validity tests; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Low–moderate psychopathy/Callous‑Unemotional traits to support an impulsive rather than predatory profile.

5) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD with dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to the documented exposures, with triggers/symptom pattern plausibly explaining the index behavior. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) are supportive but not required.

And all of these exclusions/controls:

- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; as a rule, voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse.
- No primary psychosis/mania driving the act (those raise different doctrines).
- Guard against malingering/secondary gain: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; consistency across time; collateral informants.
- No strong evidence of calculated instrumental motive (pecuniary gain, retaliation planning).
- Testing conducted promptly (ideally within 60–90 days) and standardized (sleep, meds) or replicated; heavy reliance on pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls courts should be alert to

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, anxiety about charges, medication changes can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing; seek repetition or triangulation.
- Malingering/“litigation effect”: require multiple validity indices; be wary of selective catastrophic deficits or profiles “too bad to be true.”
- Acute intoxication: clear it out as a proximate driver.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can mimic chronic stress profiles; pre‑charge records and childhood labs are the antidote.
- Over‑interpretation of glamorous biomarkers: fMRI/EEG should not be admitted to opine on “control at t0”; if admitted at all, treat as background science.
- Measurement bias: hair cortisol varies with hair type/treatments; ensure validated labs and appropriate adjustments.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)

- Offense domain: confine to reactive violent offenses (and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a standardized proffer; appoint neutral court experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Early notice and discovery of raw data; testing within a defined window.
- Expert scope: no ultimate‑issue testimony on “volitional incapacity at the moment”; limit to capacities, probabilities, and linkage.
- Jury instructions: bifurcate; give a tailored instruction that the question is substantial degradation of inhibitory control causing the act, not mere anger or hardship.
- Equity: fund indigent defendants to assemble Stage 1 records and obtain competent testing; otherwise the doctrine becomes class‑skewed.

Fallbacks and dispositions

- If the bundle falls short of clear‑and‑convincing, channel the same record to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (homicide) or to structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators.
- If the excuse is found, prefer ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pathways), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. Include victim input and periodic judicial review.

Bottom line. Treat the tests and biomarkers as corroborative pieces in a tight, pre‑specified mosaic. The decisive weight should come from (1) a documented exposure history and developmental insult, (2) pre‑offense evidence of dyscontrol, and (3) an index event that looks, sounds, and was experienced like reactive automatism. With those guardrails, the inference of substantial volitional impairment can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold without inviting floodgates.

### Speaker: Host

Wearing your Daubert gatekeeper hat, would you admit Dr. Chen’s proposed “five‑pillar” bundle as a pathway to a dyscontrol excuse, and what minimum convergence would you require before a jury ever hears it? Please be concrete about (i) which components you would presumptively exclude as too speculative (e.g., fMRI; single‑day salivary cortisol; WCST as a proxy for inhibition), (ii) which you would admit conditionally (e.g., hair cortisol; childhood BLLs; antisaccade/stop‑signal with validity checks), and (iii) the pretrial showing (documents, testing timelines, neutral expert reports) you’d demand to avoid a mini‑trial of neuroscience in every violent case.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Assessment in brief
- The Stage‑2 tools Professor Santiago lists (inhibitory‑control tasks, affective measures, cortisol profiles, historic blood‑lead levels) are not, singly, specific or time‑precise enough to prove loss of control “at the moment.” They can, however, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantially impaired inhibitory control if and only if they converge with event‑level evidence and pre‑offense documentation.
- To keep error costs tolerable, I would reserve a full excuse to a very narrow class of reactive, disorganized violent acts that look like involuntary‑rage automatism; otherwise the same evidence should channel into MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (EED) mitigation or sentencing.

Minimum bundle I would require (all must be met)
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; seconds/minutes, not hours.
- Disorganization: no luring, weapon staging, or concealment; contemporaneous reports of “blanking out/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal; video/911/body‑cam where available.
- Presumptive failure if there is planning, instrumental motive, or post‑event management.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic record of dyscontrol
- School/juvenile/clinical records predating the offense reflecting stimulus‑bound explosive episodes, dissociation, or impulse‑control problems; not created for litigation.
- Where available, prior ED visits or police contacts documenting similar episodes.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity safeguards
- At least two independent deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on tasks germane to inhibition/affect regulation (e.g., stop‑signal/go‑no‑go SSRT, antisaccade, affective go‑no‑go/affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indicators and stability across sessions or triangulation across tasks.
- I would downweight WCST; it is nonspecific. Delay‑discounting can be supportive. Avoid overreliance on PCL‑R; use only to exclude a predatory profile, not to prove dyscontrol.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑assessment diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom triggers plausibly explain the index episode, anchored to documented exposures; not opportunistic diagnoses.
- Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of at least one biologically plausible insult preceding the offense (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated, or ≥10 once; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; prenatal alcohol consistent with FASD risk), which coheres with the observed executive deficits.

And the following exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse; if substances are present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; consistency checks; collateral informants.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time, or clear instrumental motives.
- Timing: testing conducted promptly (ideally within 30–60 days) and corroborated; courts should weight pre‑offense records heavily to avoid reverse‑causation artifacts.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Sleep loss, acute legal stress, medications can depress performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions and, where feasible, repeat or corroborate with older records.
- Reverse causation: Post‑arrest stress can flatten cortisol and degrade cognition; hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and historic pediatric labs help.
- Base‑rate neglect: Many disadvantaged defendants will show some deficits; the question is substantial impairment at the moment, demonstrated by convergence and event signature.
- Neuro “glamour”: fMRI/EEG should be treated as, at best, supportive; deny talismanic weight.
- Overbreadth creep: keep the domain to reactive violence; planned acquisitive crime should be out.

Gatekeeping and administrability
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tied to a structured checklist reflecting the bundle above; clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); notice and standardized documentary proffers (medical labs, CPS/school/housing/EPA‑HUD/UI records; geocoded residence histories).
- Equality concern: if indigent funding is not provided for these showings, the doctrine should not be available at guilt.

Doctrinal channels and instructions
- If the bundle supports a true dissociative/automatistic episode, give an unconsciousness/automatism instruction (rare).
- In the far more common case where control was substantially degraded but not absent, channel to EED (MPC §210.3) for homicide, or to sentencing mitigation elsewhere. Provide a specialized instruction that poverty alone is not a defense; the evidence is admitted solely to assess whether the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply at the time.
- Bifurcate: keep guilt focused; reserve fuller life‑history evidence for the excuse/mitigation phase to protect jury concentration and public legitimacy.

Disposition
- If excused, favor ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines), with civil commitment only if the ordinary mental‑illness‑plus‑danger standard is met.

Bottom line
- Professor Santiago’s Stage‑2 criteria are directionally right; Dr. Chen’s cautions are scientifically sound. For the courtroom, the touchstone remains Hart’s fairness limit. A narrow, rule‑governed convergence requirement, confined to reactive violence and policed by neutral experts and Daubert hearings, can make this morally credible and institutionally manageable without opening floodgates.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming we adopted Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence for dyscontrol, are these administrable in your view? Please be concrete: (1) what pretrial proffer should be required to get to a jury (documents, expert reports, thresholds), and what should trigger judicial exclusion as a matter of law; (2) the precise jury instruction you’d give on the elements and burden (clear‑and‑convincing?) to avoid drift into general background sympathy; and (3) the procedural guardrails you’d insist on (court‑appointed neutral experts, Daubert hearing scope, limits on test batteries, offense exclusions). Would you confine this excuse to reactive violent offenses, and how would you police the line between this excuse and mitigation at sentencing to preserve public legitimacy?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m largely in the same place as Dr. Chen on the science: none of these tools is time‑stamped to the moment of the offense, and none is sufficiently specific standing alone. If we are to let Stage 2 carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden, courts must demand alignment across mechanism, history, and the event itself, and they must police alternative explanations aggressively. Here is how I would translate that into administrable gatekeeping.

1) What the tests and biomarkers can (and cannot) do
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective variants of Stroop) are the right family; WCST is too nonspecific to inhibition and should be down‑weighted or dropped. Results are state‑sensitive and must be buttressed by performance‑validity testing and, ideally, replication or cross‑test convergence.
- Stress and exposure markers (childhood BLLs; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; hair cortisol as a 3‑month stress window) are historically probative of mechanisms that impair control; they are not moment‑of‑offense meters. fMRI should be treated as, at best, pedagogic corroboration; it ought not be the centerpiece under Daubert/Kumho.
- Diagnoses (PTSD—especially the dissociative subtype—or Intermittent Explosive Disorder) are supportive only if grounded in pre‑offense records and structured instruments; a litigation‑born label is weak tea.

2) Minimum converging bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
Make two elements mandatory, then require at least two more from specified categories, plus exclusion of alternatives. In short: A + E + two of B/C/D below.

A. Mandatory: Event‑level reactive signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring or staged preparation; contemporaneous descriptions of “went blank/ saw red” or marked autonomic arousal. Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam, neutral eyewitnesses).

B. Pre‑offense dyscontrol documentation (at least two independent sources, one within 24 months pre‑offense)
- School IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity; pediatric or ED notes describing dissociation/rage episodes; juvenile probation/mental‑health records; sleep disruption documentation. This anchors temporality and reduces reverse‑causation worries.

C. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism (at least one, documented independent of litigation)
- Childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (repeated, or one ≥10); documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition during sensitive periods; credible FASD risk; or residence history tied to HUD/EPA lead hazard orders. These are not dispositive, but they materially raise causal plausibility when paired with D.

D. Neurocognitive/psychiatric linkage (all of the following)
- Impairment ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with intact embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity indices and either replication or cross‑task convergence.
- Low–moderate trait antisociality (avoid the PCL‑R “high” range), supporting an impulsive/reactive rather than predatory profile.
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., CAPS‑5–based PTSD with dissociation, or IED) that plausibly maps triggers/symptoms onto the index event and is consistent with pre‑offense records. Hair cortisol (flattened slope) or low resting HF‑HRV can corroborate chronic dysregulation but are not required.

E. Mandatory: Exclusion of alternative proximal drivers
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause; if substances are present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication (a strong presumption against the excuse if BAC ≥0.08 or acute stimulant use, rebuttable only by extraordinary proof).
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, malingering (multiple PVTs), and clear instrumental motives (planning, concealment, pecuniary target selection).

3) Offense domain and carve‑outs
- Limit to affective/reactive violent offenses (e.g., homicide/attempt, aggravated assaults) with tight temporal proximity between trigger and act. Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime, stalking, revenge attacks after cooling, and cases with weapon staging or significant concealment.

4) Scientific and forensic pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, pain, medication, and incarceration stress depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer corroboration by pre‑offense records; hair cortisol segmenting helps pre/post offense separation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple validity measures; require raw data disclosure; look for “too bad to be true” or selective impairment patterns; videotape clinical interviews.
- Acute intoxication: Treat as a near‑categorical bar absent exceptional proof that the same reactive act would have occurred sober.
- Reverse causation and “forensic artifact”: Give more weight to nonforensic, pre‑charge documentation than to post‑charge testing.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate error: Many defendants from deprived backgrounds will meet Stage 1; Stage 2 must not collapse into “bad background therefore bad brakes.” The event signature and pre‑offense documentation are the discriminators.

5) Procedural guardrails (administrability and fairness)
- Notice and proffer: Require early defense notice and a structured proffer keyed to the elements above, with standardized templates (geocoded exposure history; medical/CPS/school/EPA/UI records).
- Neutral expertise: Court‑appointed neutrals in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; “hot‑tubbing” of experts; mandatory raw data production; adherence to established neuropsych practice guidelines.
- Daubert/Kumho hearing: Reliability and fit determinations pretrial; fMRI and novel metrics admitted only as supportive if they clear Daubert; WCST disfavored for attribution.
- Jury management: Bifurcated proceedings; tailored instructions that (i) deficits do not equal excuse; (ii) the question is fair opportunity to comply at the time; and (iii) the defense fails if planning, instrumental motive, or intoxication drove the act.
- Equity: Fund indigent defendants to meet the same evidentiary rigors; absent parity, the doctrine will be illusory and legitimacy‑eroding.

Bottom line
As a corroborative bundle—mandatory reactive event signature and exclusion of alternatives, plus pre‑offense dyscontrol and either developmental insult or robust inhibitory deficits—the Santiago/Chen framework can, in a small class of cases, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment at the moment of offense. Anything looser will invite exactly the administrability, equality, and floodgates problems critics fear. In all other cases, RSB evidence should be channeled to mitigation, where it unquestionably belongs.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you sketch the procedural architecture you’d recommend to make Prof. Santiago’s and Dr. Chen’s dyscontrol excuse administrable without eroding legitimacy? Specifically: (i) what pretrial gatekeeping (Daubert/Frye hearings, court‑appointed neutral experts, standardized documentary proffers) and burden (clear‑and‑convincing?) would you set; (ii) would you confine eligibility to reactive violence with categorical disqualifiers (planning, substantial voluntary intoxication), and require pre‑offense corroboration of dyscontrol; and (iii) at trial, what jury instructions, verdict form (special interrogatories?), and bifurcation would best cabin the inquiry and avoid “battle of the experts”? Feel free to propose precise instruction language and note any equality/funding safeguards you view as non‑negotiable.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen’s synthesis tracks the state of the science and the limits a court must respect. As an evidentiary matter, none of the proposed measures time‑stamps volitional failure; they are, at best, mechanistic background that can corroborate an event‑level account of reactive automatism/dyscontrol. If we are to keep this doctrine narrow and administrable, Stage 2 must be anchored in the offense signature, with neurocognitive and exposure data playing a corroborative role under rigorous gatekeeping.

Admissibility and weight
- Under Daubert/Frye, stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, and affective interference tasks are testable with known error characteristics and peer‑accepted for inhibitory control, but they are state‑sensitive and coachable; WCST is too nonspecific to carry much weight. Cortisol (especially hair assays) and historic BLLs are probative of chronic stress/toxin load, not momentary control.
- Accordingly, courts should admit these as supportive, not determinative, and require performance‑validity testing, standardized administration, and, where possible, replication or pre‑offense records to guard against state artifacts.

What I would require to meet clear and convincing (all five; no single item suffices)
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation within seconds/minutes of a salient trigger; no luring, staging, or concealment; disorganized execution; contemporaneous indicia of dissociation/“seeing red”/autonomic arousal. Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam, third‑party witnesses). Material planning or delay is disqualifying.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound loss of control
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing episodic explosive reactivity/dissociation (e.g., school IEP/discipline for impulsive aggression; juvenile/ED notes; sleep disturbance tied to neighborhood stress). This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity safeguards
- At least two convergent deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on tasks directly indexing inhibition/affect‑laden control (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests and consistency across sessions; add a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting). Trait profile should be inconsistent with predatory aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R, used cautiously).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, tied to documented exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response at issue. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one relevant biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse; the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute substance effects.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the event, malingering (multiple PVTs), and clear instrumental motives.
- Testing should occur promptly and, where feasible, be repeated; courts should give greatest weight to pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls the court should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; corroborate with pre‑offense documentation (actigraphy, school notes).
- Malingering/secondary gain: insist on multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity indices; be wary of “too bad to be true” profiles or selective impairments.
- Acute intoxication: do not let chronic “toxin history” (lead, malnutrition) be conflated with alcohol/drug impairment at the offense.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑charge stress can mimic chronic profiles; hair cortisol (3‑month window) and historic pediatric labs help, but pre‑charge records are the strongest antidote.
- Over‑interpretation/glitter science: fMRI/EEG should be treated, at most, as educational; they do not establish momentary control failure.
- Base‑rate/selection biases: don’t generalize from neighborhood indices to the individual; keep the focus on the defendant’s documented history and the offense signature.

Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the five‑pillar rubric; appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; require defense notice and standardized templates for documentary proof (medical/CPS/school/EPA‑HUD/UI records; geocoded addresses).
- Limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and a narrow band of truly impulsive nonviolent acts); exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Place and enforce a clear‑and‑convincing burden on (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) that degradation being a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Jury guidance and disposition
- Define “substantial impairment” as a transient failure of inhibitory control approximating automatism, not mere difficulty resisting strong emotion. Make clear that voluntary intoxication negates the excuse.
- If excused, channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep, employment), with civil commitment available where the legal criteria are met and dangerousness persists.

Bottom line: The battery Dr. Chen outlines can help a court move from correlation to individualized attribution only when it converges with a compelling, contemporaneously corroborated event signature and pre‑offense history. If we hold to that bundle and these safeguards, we honor Hart’s fairness limit without opening the floodgates or sacrificing public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage scheme and Dr. Chen’s cautions about specificity and timing, how would you operationalize judicial gatekeeping to keep this doctrine administrable? Please be concrete: (i) the admissibility standard you’d apply at a pretrial Daubert‑style hearing (which tests/biomarkers you’d categorically exclude or downweight, e.g., fMRI, WCST, PCL‑R), (ii) the allocation/quantum of proof and how you’d instruct the jury on “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” without inviting a free‑floating sympathy verdict, and (iii) whether you would confine the excuse to reactive violent offenses only. A short model jury instruction or checklist would be helpful.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally right, but for courtroom use it needs a tighter, law‑facing bundle and clear exclusionary guardrails. None of the proposed measures proves “loss of control at t,” and Daubert demands we avoid overclaiming. The doctrine should be reserved for a narrow subset of reactive violence that looks, functionally, like automatism rather than strong emotion.

How I would translate Stage 2 into an admissibility and sufficiency framework

1) Offense signature (center of gravity)
- Required. The event must bear the hallmarks of reactive dyscontrol:
  - Sudden escalation within seconds to a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring or weapon staging; no concealment; contemporaneous witnesses/recordings describing “blanking out,” “seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal; brief post‑event confusion.
  - If there is meaningful planning, instrumental motive, or post‑event cover‑up, the defense should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Required. Nonforensic records predating the offense that show stimulus‑bound loss of control or affective lability (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive behavior, juvenile clinic notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption). This counters reverse causation and litigation artifacts.

3) Neurocognitive evidence tied to inhibition, with validity
- Required. At least two converging deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on tasks proximate to inhibitory control/affect regulation (e.g., stop‑signal or Go/No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, an affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus intact and multiple performance‑validity indices. Repeat or cross‑task convergence to blunt state noise (sleep, meds, acute stress).
- Downweight WCST; include delay discounting cautiously. Avoid overreliance on PCL‑R; if used, it should not be the determinant and courts should be aware of its limitations and bias concerns.

4) Clinical linkage that maps mechanism to the index event
- Required. A qualified diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established with structured instruments, anchored to pre‑existing exposures, and with symptom content that plausibly explains the index event (triggers, dissociation). Collateral corroboration preferred.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Strongly preferred for guilt‑phase excuse; otherwise, this should go to mitigation. Examples:
  - Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or one ≥10) during sensitive windows; or documented FASD risk; or iron‑deficiency/malnutrition with clinical markers; or verified prenatal substance exposure.
- Stress physiology (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not specific; admit as corroboration, not as a linchpin. I would not admit fMRI for case‑level attribution; the field does not support individual diagnosis or time‑locking volition.

Clear‑and‑convincing minimum bundle (all must be met unless noted)
- Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol.
- Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol.
- Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity checks and cross‑task convergence.
- Clinical diagnosis mapping to the offense.
- One objective developmental insult as above, or, in the rare case where no “hard” biomarker exists, a showing of extraordinary cumulative adversity plus robust pre‑offense dyscontrol records of such weight that the biology requirement can be waived by the court for good cause.
- Causation instruction: the impairment must be found to have substantially degraded inhibitory control and been a substantial contributing cause of the instant act—more than mere risk elevation.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; mixed cases require proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB belongs in insanity or not at all.
- Evidence of malingering or coaching (failed multiple PVTs, “too bad to be true” patterns) defeats the showing.
- Planned acquisitive crime presumptively excluded.
- Testing must occur early, with standardized conditions; courts should rely heavily on pre‑charge records to avoid “forensic artifact” effects.

Daubert/administrability notes
- Testability and known error rates: stop‑signal and antisaccade have acceptable psychometrics; Stroop is less specific; WCST is not mechanism‑proximate—limit its weight. Hair cortisol is increasingly used but is vulnerable to confounds; require laboratory standards and disclosure of hair treatments. Historic BLLs from pediatric records are reliable.
- General acceptance: neuropsych batteries and childhood BLLs clear that bar; fMRI does not for individual attribution.
- Neutral experts: appoint court‑retained neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health experts to review raw data, validity testing, and exposure records. Require standardized proffers (geocoded residence, school, CPS, medical labs) before any jury hears this.
- Jury instructions: frame the standard as Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment if the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply because of an acute, involuntary failure of inhibitory control akin to automatism, not mere anger or character.

Scientific pitfalls courts should be alert to
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication effects depress performance and flatten cortisol. Prefer repeated testing, actigraphy where available, and pre‑offense documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: use multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; seek cross‑setting consistency (school, work, medical).
- Acute intoxication: separate developmental “toxin” history (lead, FASD) from alcohol/drug intoxication at t. The latter should usually bar the excuse.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense stress can mimic chronic stress markers; weight pre‑charge records heavily.
- Base‑rate problem: many with similar exposures do not offend. Hence the insistence on event‑level signature plus pre‑offense dyscontrol and mechanism‑proximate deficits.

Scope and disposition
- Limit to reactive violent offenses (and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts). This preserves public legitimacy and prevents drift into broad socioeconomic absolution.
- If the excuse is found, use ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions with court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous and meet statutory criteria.

Bottom line
The Stage 2 suite can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference when it converges across event, history, mechanism, and exclusion of alternatives. Courts should make the offense signature and pre‑offense records do most of the work; treat neuropsychology as corroboration with validity safeguards; require at least one objective developmental insult for guilt‑phase excusal in all but exceptional cases; and keep fMRI and expressive theories at the door. This is how we honor Hart’s fairness limit without opening the floodgates.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as givens, what would an administrable courtroom architecture look like to keep this narrow and legitimate? Specifically: (1) what Daubert-style findings should a trial judge make at a pretrial hearing (e.g., required datasets, validity testing, exclusion of intoxication) before the jury ever hears RSB dyscontrol evidence; and (2) what single, concise jury instruction would you give on the ultimate question (fair opportunity to comply) to avoid overreach or confusion? Please include your view on burden (clear and convincing?) and whether you would limit the defense to reactive violent offenses via a special verdict form.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Short answer from the bench: none of these instruments or biomarkers can time‑stamp loss of control; they are, at best, supportive of a mechanistic story. Used singly, they risk Daubert problems and Rule 403 prejudice. Used in a tightly specified bundle, anchored to event‑level facts and pre‑offense records, they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow class of reactive cases.

On the tools themselves
- Neurocognitive batteries (Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) sensibly target inhibition/affect regulation. WCST is least probative of the mechanism at issue and should be down‑weighted. All such testing is state‑sensitive; repeat or corroborate, and require performance validity testing.
- Stress/exposure markers (hair/diurnal cortisol, historic childhood BLLs, documented malnutrition/iron deficiency) are not temporally specific to the offense but raise plausibility when they predate the crime and align with deficits.
- I would treat fMRI/advanced imaging as, at most, background science; in most criminal courts it should be excluded under Daubert/403 as unduly prejudicial for minimal probative increment.

What I would require to reach “clear and convincing”
Make two elements mandatory and then require two of three additional pillars—each supported by documentary or objective evidence, not just post‑charge narrative:

Mandatory cores
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/bodycam/witnesses) of “seeing red/blanking out,” autonomic arousal, confusion. If planning/cover‑up is present, the excuse should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile/ED notes of dissociation/IED; sleep disturbance records) to satisfy temporality and guard against reverse causation.

Plus at least two of the following three
3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairments on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal RT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with intact embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests and stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence. Include a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy/antisocial trait scores to support an impulsive (not predatory) profile.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to verified exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and response. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or any ≥10), documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia, or well‑documented FASD risk—predating the offense—and plausibly linked to current executive deficits.

Disqualifiers and necessary exclusions
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Primary psychosis/mania not traceable to the asserted RSB mechanism, acute TBI at the time of offense, strong instrumental motives, or malingering (failed PVTs, “too bad to be true” profiles) should defeat the claim.
- Testing conducted only after charge and under high custodial stress must be corroborated by pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact” findings.

Scientific/pedagogic pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: sleep loss, meds, acute stress can depress performance and cortisol. Standardize, repeat where feasible, and lean on pre‑charge documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity indices, collateral informants, and internal consistency across tasks.
- Reverse causation: custody itself can flatten cortisol and impair testing; hair cortisol can help with a pre‑offense window, but the best antidote is old records (schools, pediatric labs, CPS, housing/EPA).
- Base‑rate and ecological fallacies: neighborhood‑level adversity explains risk; it does not establish case‑level causation without the other pillars.
- Over‑weighting “brain made me do it”: juries tend to ascribe outsized causal force to neuroscience. Use limiting instructions; keep the science in a supporting role.

Administrability guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health). If the proffer does not meet the threshold, the evidence is reserved for sentencing mitigation, not guilt.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and the rare truly impulsive nonviolent act); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Resource parity orders for indigent defendants; standardized templates for documentary proof; protective orders for sensitive records.
- Model jury instruction and special verdict interrogatories focusing jurors on the two elements that matter: (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time of offense and (ii) that this degradation, stemming from cumulative deprivation, was a substantial contributing cause.

Bottom line: I largely agree with Prof. Santiago and Dr. Chen on substance. The neurocognitive and biomarker suite is not specific or temporally sharp standing alone; as part of a convergent, pre‑specified package—dominated by event‑level facts and pre‑offense history—it can carry a narrow excuse without opening floodgates. Cases that satisfy the science but stumble on planning or intoxication belong in MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (for homicide) or at sentencing, not in a full excuse. This respects Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit while keeping error costs and public legitimacy in view.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution bundle as the working architecture, translate this into the courtroom: what would your model jury instruction for a dyscontrol excuse look like? Please be concrete on (i) the definition of “substantial impairment of inhibitory control,” (ii) the causation standard (e.g., substantial contributing factor), (iii) explicit exclusions (e.g., voluntary intoxication, planned/instrumental conduct), and (iv) how jurors should weigh converging scientific/non‑scientific evidence without overvaluing any single test. Also, would you require unanimity on each pillar or only on the ultimate excuse verdict? Keep it focused on administrability and error‑costs.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery:

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is broadly on the right track for courtroom use if we treat the science as corroborative, not dispositive, and insist on convergence. None of these tools can timestamp loss of control; the law’s role is to ask whether there was a fair opportunity to comply (Hart) and whether what happened looks like “I couldn’t help myself” rather than “I chose this.” That means tight admissibility and a high evidentiary floor.

Admissibility and weight under Daubert-type screening
- Neurocognitive tasks
  - Generally admissible as supportive evidence with known error rates and peer review. Prioritize tasks that bear directly on inhibition/reactivity (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go with valid SSRT; antisaccade; affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop). Downweight WCST and classic Stroop—they’re less specific to the mechanism at issue.
  - Require multiple performance-validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and, ideally, re‑testing to address state noise (sleep, meds, immediate legal stress).
- Stress/exposure markers
  - Historic blood lead levels (BLLs) from childhood and EPA/HUD orders are reliable, objective anchors of developmental exposure; they increase causal plausibility when paired with executive deficits.
  - Hair/diurnal cortisol and HRV are supportive of chronic stress but not specific; admit with caution and never as stand‑alone proof of dyscontrol at time of offense.
  - fMRI/EEG: admit only, if at all, as background science with limiting instructions; they do not prove momentary volitional failure and risk undue weight.
- Psychiatric diagnosis
  - Structured-diagnostic PTSD (including dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder can be probative if anchored to pre‑offense records and mapped to the index event; guard against litigation‑driven diagnoses.

Minimum converging bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard
I would require all of the following, with no single element sufficient:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; no luring/staging/cover‑up; disorganized execution. Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam audio, contemporaneous witness descriptions of “went blank/seeing red,” autonomic arousal).

2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile MH notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits, sleep problems tied to environment).

3) Neurocognitive evidence of impaired inhibition with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/affective Stroop), intact PVTs, and cross‑test or repeat‑session stability. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available. Low/moderate psychopathic trait profile to support reactive (not predatory) aggression.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that plausibly maps to the event
- Structured diagnosis (PTSD/IED) with symptom content and timing that explain the trigger–response sequence; supportive chronic‑stress biomarker (hair cortisol) helpful but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of at least one biological insult (elevated childhood BLLs—ideally repeated or any ≥10 µg/dL; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) temporally preceding observed control deficits.

And all of these disqualifiers/controls:
- Exclude where substantial voluntary intoxication is the proximate driver; the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute substance effects.
- Exclude malingering via multiple validity checks, inconsistency flags, and collateral corroboration.
- Exclude primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures, acute TBI at offense, or clear instrumental motive/planning.
- Timing safeguards: testing as early as practicable, plus reliance on pre‑charge records to blunt reverse‑causation (incarceration stress) claims.

Key scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: sleep loss, medication changes, acute legal stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions, use actigraphy/collateral sleep documentation where feasible, and prefer repeat or convergent findings.
- Malingering/secondary gain: “too bad to be true” patterns, selective failures on easy tasks; insist on multiple PVTs and cross‑source consistency.
- Acute intoxication: a frequent spoiler; separate developmental toxins (lead) from acute substances (alcohol/stimulants).
- Base‑rate/ecological fallacy: high neighborhood adversity does not equal individual dyscontrol; Stage 2 must be individual‑focused.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: especially fMRI; keep them in a strictly supportive lane with limiting instructions.

Institutional guardrails (administrability and equality)
- Pretrial notice and a structured Daubert proffer keyed to the elements above; use court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to avoid partisan shopping.
- Limit offense domain to reactive violent episodes (and a narrow class of truly impulsive nonviolent acts). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that degradation substantially contributed to the act.
- Bifurcated proceedings and specialized jury instructions (this is an excuse about impaired capacity, not a justification; it does not apply if the defendant had a fair opportunity to comply or acted with planning).
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

Disposition
- If the excuse is found: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused therapy, safe housing relocation, sleep/nutrition interventions, job pathways), with risk assessment and, where statutory criteria are met, civil commitment for those who remain dangerous. If the excuse fails, the same record should inform structured mitigation at sentencing.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 list captures what courts should require, with two refinements: (i) tighten the cognitive battery to tasks squarely about inhibition/affect under validity controls, and (ii) elevate event‑level proof and pre‑offense documentation as the anchor. With those adjustments and the guardrails above, you can honor Hart’s fairness limit without opening the floodgates or slighting victims.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, Dr. Chen sketches a five‑pillar convergence (event signature, pre‑offense records, validated neurocognitive deficits, DSM‑anchored linkage, and an objective exposure biomarker) plus disqualifiers (intoxication, malingering). From an administrability and evidence-law perspective: (1) Would you formalize these as the elements of a pretrial RSB‑dyscontrol hearing with a clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense? (2) Which components should pass Daubert/Kumho and reach the jury versus be screened and found by the judge only (e.g., hair cortisol, SSRT, PCL‑R, historic BLLs)? (3) How would you instruct the jury to decide “substantial impairment of volitional control at the time” without turning the guilt phase into a mini‑trial on social science? Please be concrete about procedures (structured proffers, neutral court experts, limiting instructions), any special interrogatories or verdict forms, and whether you would narrow the doctrine to reactive violence and exclude cases with evidence of planning.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

Bottom line. None of the Stage‑2 tools (stop‑signal, Stroop, WCST, cortisol, historic BLLs) can, standing alone, time‑stamp a loss of control. Used together, tied to pre‑offense documentation and an event signature of reactive violence, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a narrow band of cases. The court’s job is fit and triangulation, not talismanic reliance on any single assay.

Specificity and temporal sensitivity

- Neurocognitive tasks
  - Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go (SSRT) and antisaccade are the most mechanism‑proximal for inhibition; useful if deficits are robust and reproducible with validity checks.
  - Affective variants (emotional Go‑No‑Go/affective Stroop) add relevance for anger‑triggered assaults.
  - Classic Stroop contributes, but is less specific.
  - WCST (set‑shifting) is least specific to inhibitory dyscontrol; I would downweight or omit it.
  - All testing must include multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and, ideally, a second session to address state noise.

- Stress/exposure markers
  - Hair cortisol (3‑cm segment) is a better window on chronic stress than single‑day salivary profiles; still nonspecific and influenced by hair treatments and ethnicity—supportive only.
  - Childhood blood lead (BLL) records are probative of developmental injury to prefrontal systems if elevations occurred during sensitive periods; they do not speak to the moment, but they bolster biological plausibility when paired with current executive deficits.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition/FASD documentation is likewise supportive, not dispositive.

Minimum bundle to meet clear and convincing

I would require all of the following; no single element suffices:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation (seconds to a minute or two) after a salient provocation; disorganized, non‑instrumental execution; contemporaneous descriptions of “seeing red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal; corroborated where possible by video/911/bodycam. Evidence of luring, weapon staging, ambush, or concealment/planning is a strong disqualifier.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, pediatric/ED notes, juvenile mental health, CPS documentation) evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control or affective lability. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity and convergence
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indices and either repeat confirmation or cross‑test convergence; include a choice‑impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive, not predatory aggression (use caution with PCL‑R; low‑to‑moderate range and collateral history are more probative than a bare score).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., CAPS‑5 for PTSD, or Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and dissociation described in the offense. Physiological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of at least one biologically plausible insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 μg/dL—ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; documented IDA/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) that predate and plausibly contribute to current executive deficits.

And all of the following exclusions/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse; trace co‑use does not, but the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, consistency across sessions and sources, collateral informant reports.
- Alternative causes ruled out: primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time of offense, clear instrumental motives.
- Testing timeliness: conducted as early as feasible (ideally within 30–60 days) and interpreted in light of pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Scientific and forensic pitfalls to police

- State–trait confounds: Sleep loss, acute legal stress, medication changes can depress test performance and cortisol. Standardize testing (sleep/caffeine/meds), consider actigraphy, and, where feasible, repeat.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use batteries with multiple validity indicators; beware selective, “too bad to be true” deficits.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition. Distinguish developmental toxin history (lead, FASD) from acute substance effects.
- Reverse causation: Post‑arrest stress can flatten cortisol and alter performance; lean heavily on pre‑offense documentation.
- Glamour evidence: fMRI/EEG can mislead; if admitted at all, they should be strictly supportive with clear limiting instructions.
- Measurement equity: Ensure tests use appropriate demographic norms; account for literacy/language/motor speed; avoid pathologizing poverty‑related educational gaps.
- PCL‑R misuse: Treat as one datapoint; avoid over‑weighting scores; focus on collateral history of predation vs impulsivity.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)

- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a structured proffer satisfying the five‑pillar bundle; appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Standardized discovery templates for objective records (medical labs, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD, unemployment insurance), with privacy protections; resource parity for indigent defendants.
- Offense constraint: limit to reactive violent offenses (and, in rare instances, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Clear jury instruction: biomarkers and tests cannot determine mental state at an instant; they may be considered only insofar as they, together with all the evidence, make it highly probable the defendant’s inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation substantially caused the act.

This package keeps us within Hart’s “fair opportunity” limit, answers deterrence and legitimacy concerns by narrowing the class, and gives trial courts workable gatekeeping criteria.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions as givens, could you sketch a model jury instruction that defines “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse? Please specify: (i) the burden and standard (you prefer), (ii) what jurors may consider (event‑level signs, neurocognitive findings with validity checks, documented developmental exposures) and must not consider as exculpatory (e.g., voluntary intoxication, mere poverty absent impairment), and (iii) a clear causation formulation (e.g., “substantial contributing cause” vs. “but‑for”). If you favor a special verdict form or bifurcation to minimize confusion, note that briefly. Aim for a concise, charge‑ready paragraph or two.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s architecture and Dr. Chen’s cautions. From a court’s gatekeeping vantage, nothing in Stage 2 by itself time‑stamps loss of control; you get to clear‑and‑convincing only when multiple, independent strands line up and obvious alternative drivers are excluded. I would formalize Stage 2 into a narrowly cabined, administrable test, with bright‑line exclusions, a defined offense domain, and a standardized pretrial proffer.

1) Offense domain and bright‑line exclusions
- Eligible offenses: reactive, affective violence (e.g., sudden assaults/homicides) occurring within minutes of a salient provocation. I would not extend this doctrine to planned acquisitive crimes, robberies with pre‑arming, luring, or concealment behavior.
- Per se disqualifiers:
  - Substantial voluntary intoxication temporally proximate to the act (alcohol/stimulants/sedatives at levels likely to drive inhibition failure).
  - Evidence of instrumental planning (weapon staging, luring, ambush, coordinated getaway) or post‑event concealment indicative of intact executive control.
  - High psychopathic trait profile suggesting predatory aggression.
  - Forensic artifact concerns that cannot be cured (e.g., testing conducted long after offense with no pre‑offense corroboration).

2) Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with neutral experts
- Require a structured proffer tied to the elements below.
- Appoint neutral experts in (i) forensic neuropsychology, (ii) psychiatry/traumatology, and (iii) environmental health/toxicology (FRE 706 analog), with funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Exclude under reliability/prudence: novelty‑driven imaging (most fMRI/QEEG), single‑day salivary cortisol. Admit as supportive only where methodologically sound: hair cortisol (3‑cm segment), historical blood‑lead records, standardized neurocognitive tasks with performance‑validity testing.

3) Minimum bundle for clear‑and‑convincing attribution (all five pillars required)
A. Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a concrete trigger; disorganized execution; no concealment; contemporaneous observations of dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”), autonomic arousal. Bodycam/video/911 audio is highly probative. Any evidence of deliberation defeats this pillar.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control: school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes (dissociation/IED), ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption. This addresses temporality and the reverse‑causation worry.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity checks
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with valid SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), plus a convergent impulsive‑choice measure (delay discounting), all with multiple performance‑validity tests. Replication across sessions or cross‑test convergence strengthens weight.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive—not predatory—aggression; use PCL‑R cautiously and avoid over‑reliance.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response in the instant event.
- Supportive chronic‑stress physiology (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol over prior 3 months) may be admitted as corroboration, not as a stand‑alone.

E. Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult during sensitive periods: childhood blood‑lead history (≥5 µg/dL on repeated measures, or a prior ≥10), documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk, with corroboration that these exposures predated and plausibly contribute to present inhibitory deficits.

And all of the following controls must be satisfied:
- Toxicology: demonstrate that any substances present did not primarily drive the loss of control; substantial voluntary intoxication bars the excuse.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded/stand‑alone performance‑validity tests; cross‑source consistency; beware “too bad to be true” selective failures.
- Alternative diagnoses excluded: primary psychosis/mania as proximate cause; acute TBI at the time of offense; clear instrumental motives.

4) Scientific pitfalls for courts to watch
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, or carceral stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing, and privilege pre‑offense records over post‑charge findings.
- Ecological/base‑rate errors: do not infer case‑level causation from group correlations; Stage 1 shows plausibility, Stage 2 must show proximal impairment.
- Test bias and norms: ensure appropriate normative data for race/ethnicity/education; require examiners to address measurement error and practice effects.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: BLLs and hair cortisol index risk and chronic load, not momentary control; use only to bolster a mechanism already supported by history and testing.

5) Jury instruction (if the court finds the proffer sufficient to go to the jury)
- Bifurcate. In the responsibility phase, instruct:
  - “The question is whether, at the time of the act, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate aggressive response was substantially impaired such that he lacked a fair opportunity to comply with the law. You must find both that (i) such impairment existed and (ii) it was a substantial contributing cause of the act.”
  - “Evidence of poverty or hardship alone is not a defense. Evidence created for litigation should be weighed against records made before the offense. Voluntary intoxication cannot serve as the basis for this excuse.”
  - Offer a partial‑mitigation instruction (e.g., MPC extreme emotional disturbance in homicide) if the full excuse standard is not met but the record supports reduced culpability.

6) Disposition
- Where the full excuse is found and the person remains dangerous: prefer ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision tailored to the demonstrated mechanism (trauma‑focused therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, housing relocation out of criminogenic environments, job supports), with civil commitment available under existing standards if mental illness renders the person dangerous.
- Where the evidence falls short of excuse: treat as mitigation at sentencing within structured guidelines keyed to verified deprivation indicators and biological insults.

Why this gate will not flood the docket
- Convergence across (1) a qualifying event signature; (2) pre‑offense dyscontrol records; (3) validated neurocognitive deficits; (4) a diagnosis that maps to the event; and (5) an objective developmental insult—plus exclusion of intoxication and planning—will limit viable claims to a small subset of reactive‑violence cases. In my experience, even in large jurisdictions, only a single‑digit percentage would clear a Daubert hearing, and fewer would persuade a jury.

This approach keeps faith with Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply—while preserving administrability and public legitimacy through tight elements, neutral expertise, bifurcation, and careful instructions. It also answers victim‑protection and equality concerns by confining the doctrine to momentary dyscontrol, resourcing both sides, and channeling most RSB evidence to structured mitigation when the full excuse is not warranted.

---

### Speaker: Host

From the bench, how would you structure the pretrial gatekeeping and the jury charge to make Santiago/Chen’s dyscontrol excuse administrable while preserving fairness? Please be concrete: (i) burden/standard and the precise elements the defense must proffer at a Daubert‑style hearing; (ii) whether to appoint neutral neuropsych/psychiatry/environmental experts and how to cabin junk science; (iii) offense‑domain limits (e.g., reactive violence only); and (iv) a short model jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and the causation link required. If you’d tweak or trim any of the proposed indicators/tests (e.g., WCST, cortisol, hair assays), say so and explain why.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s headline: none of these tools timestamps loss of control; they acquire probative force only as a convergent bundle tied to the event. From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, I would cabin any dyscontrol excuse to reactive violence and require a tight, judge‑screened showing under a clear‑and‑convincing standard. My view:

1) What the tests can and cannot do
- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the most relevant inhibition assays; Stroop/WCST are ancillary. All are state‑sensitive and coachable; they must be paired with multiple performance‑validity tests and, ideally, re‑administration or cross‑task convergence.
- Historic BLLs (childhood) and documented FASD/malnutrition raise mechanistic plausibility; they do not speak to the moment. Hair cortisol affords a rough 2–3 month window; single‑day salivary cortisol is too noisy. None of these biomarkers is specific to legal “dyscontrol.”
- fMRI should almost never reach a jury; at most, it is supplemental in a Daubert hearing. Its prejudicial aura exceeds its incremental probative value for momentary volition.

2) Minimum converging bundle I would require
All six elements below; failure on any one defeats the excuse and moves the evidence, at most, to mitigation or EED in homicide.

A. Event signature
- Acute provocation followed by near‑immediate, disorganized aggression; no staging, luring, retrieval of weapons from another location, or concealment. Prefer contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam; neutral eyewitness).

B. Pre‑offense history (non‑forensic)
- School, medical, juvenile, or employment records predating the offense that document stimulus‑bound rage/dissociation/impulse‑control failures (e.g., IEPs, ED visits, PTSD notes). This guards against reverse causation.

C. Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indices and either stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression (low–moderate PCL‑R used cautiously).

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index act
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the event. Physiologic corroboration (hair cortisol flattening, low HF‑HRV) is supportive, not required.

E. Objective developmental insult
- Independent documentation of at least one biologically plausible exposure (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or any ≥10; clear FASD risk; documented early malnutrition/IDA) occurring in sensitive periods, plus a plausible link to the observed deficits.

F. Exclusions/controls
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver; if substances are present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI, and strong instrumental motives.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, collateral informants, internal consistency.

3) Judicial gatekeeping and procedures
- Notice and structured proffer tied to the elements above; pretrial Daubert hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Standardized testing protocol (sleep/medication stabilization; timing within ~60 days where feasible; opportunity for prosecution retest; disclosure of raw data).
- Limiting the excuse to reactive violent offenses; where the bundle is incomplete, channel to MPC‑style EED (homicide) or sentencing mitigation.

4) Scientific and legal pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, jail stress, medication effects; mitigate with standardized conditions, repetition, and pre‑offense records.
- Coaching/secondary gain: rely on multiple PVTs; beware “too bad to be true” patterns or selective impairment on easy‑to‑feign tasks.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: hair cortisol and BLLs increase plausibility but do not prove momentary dyscontrol; fMRI should almost always be excluded.
- Cultural/measurement bias: use appropriate norms and guard against conflating socioeconomic disadvantage with impairment.
- Voluntary intoxication: should presumptively defeat the excuse.
- Planning indicators: any meaningful preparation or goal‑directed concealment should be a bright‑line exclusion.

5) Jury management and disposition
- Bifurcation and a tailored instruction: the question is not whether adversity explains behavior in general, but whether, at the moment, inhibitory control was substantially degraded so that the defendant could not reasonably have refrained.
- If excused: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision; civil commitment only where lawful and necessary for ongoing dangerousness. Otherwise, use the same evidence for calibrated mitigation at sentencing.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 elements point in the right direction, but courts should insist on a compact, pre‑specified bundle and bright‑line disqualifiers. That keeps the doctrine morally coherent, scientifically honest, and institutionally governable—and confines a full excuse to the rare, automatism‑like case, with the rest addressed by EED and structured mitigation.

### Speaker: Host

Building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions, please draft a concise model jury instruction for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse. It should: (1) state the defense’s clear‑and‑convincing burden; (2) enumerate required elements in plain language—objective proof of cumulative deprivation, at least one developmental biological insult, reliable neurocognitive evidence of impaired inhibition with validity checks, event‑level features consistent with reactive (not planned) aggression, and exclusion of voluntary intoxication as a proximate cause; (3) guide jurors on how to weigh expert testimony and conflicting evidence; and (4) direct that if the defense fails on any element, jurors may still consider the same evidence for mitigation (e.g., extreme emotional disturbance or sentencing). Keep it tight—something a trial judge could actually give.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen’s scientific cautions and with Prof. Santiago’s two‑gate structure. For a court worried about error costs and public legitimacy, the Stage‑2 attribution has to be tighter and more rule‑governed than what we typically see in “diminished capacity” litigation. My touchstones are: (1) a reactive, automaticity‑like event signature; (2) pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol; (3) converging but limited use of neurocognitive and exposure markers; and (4) rigorous exclusion of alternative drivers (planning, intoxication, malingering). Biomarkers are corroborative; they do not carry the day.

1) What the tests and markers can and cannot do
- Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go and antisaccade tasks, with valid SSRT, are the most relevant to inhibitory control; Stroop/WCST have limited specificity and should be down‑weighted or replaced by affective inhibition tasks (emotional Go‑No‑Go/affective Stroop).
- Hair cortisol (3‑month window) is more useful than a single diurnal salivary curve, but both are nonspecific and state‑sensitive; they corroborate chronic load at best.
- Historic childhood BLLs (ideally multiple measures, or any ≥10 µg/dL) and documented early malnutrition/IDA are probative of developmental insult but are not time‑stamps.
- Functional neuroimaging (fMRI/EEG) is high on prejudice and low on case‑specific probativity; absent exceptional circumstances, I would exclude under 403 or admit only with a limiting instruction and a neutral expert.

2) Minimum converging bundle to clear a clear‑and‑convincing threshold (both for admissibility and for submission to a jury)
A. Event‑level signature (required)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions of “blanking out/seeing red,” autonomic arousal. Prefer objective corroboration (video/911/body‑cam). If there was planning or cover‑up, stop.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (required)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense of stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school IEPs/discipline for explosive behavior; juvenile/ED notes of dissociation/IED; sleep disruption tied to neighborhood conditions). This addresses temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity (required)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT and antisaccade or affective Go‑No‑Go), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and, where feasible, replication across sessions. Include a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available. Down‑weight WCST; use Stroop only as part of a broader battery.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage (required)
- Structured‑interview DSM‑5 diagnosis consistent with mechanism (PTSD—dissociative subtype or Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to pre‑offense exposures; symptom content plausibly maps to the index event. Physiologic corroboration (hair cortisol flattening, low resting HF‑HRV) is supportive but not mandatory.

E. Objective developmental insult (required)
- Independent records of at least one biological insult consistent with prefrontal/affect‑regulation vulnerability (childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated or any ≥10; documented IDA/malnutrition; prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk). This is a plausibility anchor, not a moment‑level measure.

F. Disqualifiers/controls (must be negative or satisfactorily addressed)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication proximate to the act (defeats the excuse absent strong evidence of baseline dyscontrol driving the event).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at offense; strong instrumental motive; malingering (failures on PVTs or “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles).
- Testing conducted promptly (ideally within 30–60 days) and interpreted against pre‑offense records to minimize forensic artifact.

3) Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing with a structured proffer tied to the items above; appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized templates for documentary proof (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA/HUD, UI records; geocoded histories).
- Limit offense domain to reactive violent offenses (and the rare truly impulsive nonviolent act); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Defense burden: clear and convincing that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Bifurcation/special interrogatory to keep the jury’s focus: instruct separately on this excuse (distinct from insanity) with a definition keyed to Hart’s fairness limit (“no fair opportunity to comply”).

4) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing (sleep, meds, caffeine), prefer repeated/triangulated assessments; use pre‑offense records to anchor trait.
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; cross‑source consistency.
- Intoxication: draw a bright line; voluntary intoxication generally defeats the excuse.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance; hair cortisol and historical records help, but the court should treat post‑charge‑only evidence skeptically.
- Over‑interpretation: bar “brain‑scan theatrics”; treat all biomarkers as corroboration, never dispositive.

5) Doctrinal placement and disposition
- To protect administrability and equality, I would cabin a freestanding RSB excuse to an automatism‑adjacent “involuntary‑rage” doctrine meeting the bundle above. For homicides that don’t meet automatism‑adjacent loss of control, use MPC‑style EED mitigation. In all other cases, channel RSB to sentencing, using validated deprivation indicators.
- If the excuse is found, prefer ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under close court supervision (trauma care, stable housing, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines); reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. Ensure victims’ voice at disposition.

Bottom line: Stage‑2 can support a legally sufficient inference only when mechanism, history, and moment line up with neutral, objective corroboration and obvious alternatives are excluded. Anything looser belongs at sentencing, not at guilt.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as given, how would you translate this into a workable doctrine at trial? Specifically: (1) would you cabin it as an affirmative excuse with a clear‑and‑convincing burden, or treat it as failure‑of‑proof on mens rea/voluntariness, and would you require a special verdict on “reactive dyscontrol at time T”? (2) What Daubert gatekeeping language and neutral‑expert appointment practices would you codify to manage SSRT/Stroop, cortisol, and historic BLL evidence without turning the guilt phase into a mini‑bench trial? (3) What jury instruction text would you use to anchor “no fair opportunity to conform” without inviting nullification? And (4) if you think this remains institutionally perilous at guilt, make the case for relegating it to sentencing: what administrability or equality‑of‑arms problems push you there, and how would you structure mitigation guidelines to preserve public legitimacy and victims’ interests?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Building on Dr. Chen’s scientific assessment, here is the judicial lens: the Stage 2 attribution has to do two things simultaneously—survive evidentiary scrutiny (reliability/fit under Daubert or its state analog) and give a jury a principled way to conclude, clearly and convincingly, that volitional control was substantially degraded at the moment of offense. No single instrument will do that job. The only administrable path is a convergent bundle with pre‑specified pillars, plus disqualifiers, presented in a focused pretrial hearing and channeled to a narrow class of reactive violent offenses.

What is specific enough, and what is not
- The neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop/flanker) have moderate construct validity for inhibitory control; WCST is least probative of the mechanism at issue. These tests are not time‑stamped to the offense and are state‑sensitive; they are supportive, not dispositive.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic BLLs are mechanism‑consistent but nonspecific; they strengthen plausibility when paired with developmental timing (e.g., elevated BLLs in early childhood) and current inhibition deficits.
- fMRI/EEG should be treated as ancillary at best; reverse‑inference risks and weak temporal linkage mean they rarely add more than color.

Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard
Require all five pillars below, each supported by objective or validated evidence, and the absence of listed disqualifiers. The defense bears the burden.

1) Event‑level reactive signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; no luring, staging, or concealment; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions (from witnesses, 911, body‑cam) of “seeing red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal. If there is planning or instrumental post‑event behavior, the excuse should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes, prior ED visits for rage episodes, documented sleep disruption). This anchors temporality and guards against reverse causation from the charges/incarceration.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and either repeat testing or cross‑test convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive aggression (e.g., low‑to‑moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, tied to the Stage‑1 exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and response in the instant offense.
- Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not mandatory.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented exposure: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or a prior ≥10), iron‑deficiency/malnutrition markers, or credible FASD risk—with timing consistent with prefrontal development. These do not excuse by themselves; they bolster the causal chain when paired with current deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at the time of offense; strong instrumental motive; or malingering (failed PVTs) defeats the excuse.
- Testing must occur as early as practicable and be standardized (sleep, meds, caffeine) with collateral verification; heavy reliance on post‑charge, one‑off testing without pre‑offense records should be insufficient.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and litigation stress depress performance and cortisol. Standardize, consider actigraphy/collaterals, and favor repeated or corroborated testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; beware selective or “too bad to be true” deficits.
- Acute intoxication: separate historic toxin exposure (lead, FASD) from alcohol/drug effects contemporaneous with the act.
- Reverse causation: incarceration and trauma from the offense can flatten cortisol and impair testing; give greatest weight to pre‑offense records.
- Neuro‑overreach: fMRI/EEG and single‑day salivary cortisol are easily over‑interpreted; keep them in a supporting, not determinative, role.

Procedural guardrails to keep the gate tight and fair
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to the five pillars and disqualifiers, with court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and standardized proffers: geocoded exposure histories; medical/CPS/school/housing/EPA‑HUD/UI records; testing protocols with validity indices.
- Offense limitation: confine to genuinely reactive violent offenses and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts; exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden/standard: clear and convincing evidence that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act; not the sole cause, but more than a mere background risk.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

Jury instruction (model)
“If you find by clear and convincing evidence that at the time of the offense the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate, affect‑driven impulse was substantially degraded, and that this degradation, stemming from documented developmental exposures, was a substantial contributing cause of the act, you must return a verdict of not guilty by reason of excused dyscontrol. If you do not so find, you must apply the ordinary rules. Evidence of difficult background alone is not a defense.”

Disposition
If excused, channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma treatment, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports), with civil commitment available where the person remains dangerous. If the bundle falls short, the same evidence should be available for structured mitigation at sentencing.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 elements are directionally sound if the court insists on convergence across event signature, pre‑offense history, valid neurocognitive deficits, diagnosis mapping to the event, and an objective developmental insult, while excluding intoxication, malingering, and instrumental crime. That bundle, plus neutral‑expert gatekeeping and narrow offense scope, gives us a doctrine that honors Hart’s fairness limit without inviting floodgates or sacrificing public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Building on Prof. Santiago’s gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions, please draft a model jury instruction for a narrowly tailored RSB–dyscontrol excuse. It should specify the elements the jury must find (substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time of offense; causal linkage to cumulative deprivation with at least one documented biological insult; exclusion of voluntary intoxication and instrumental planning) and the defendant’s burden (clear and convincing). Include any limiting language you’d add to reduce prejudice or confusion (e.g., how to treat expert testimony, what the defense is not), and keep it succinct enough to be workable at trial.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Ellery (Ret.):

I share Dr. Chen’s bottom line: none of these tools, standing alone, can time‑stamp loss of control. They can, however, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference when they converge with a reactive event signature and pre‑offense documentation. The law’s task is to translate that scientific caution into administrable gates.

1) How probative are the proposed measures?

- Neurocognitive tasks
  - Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with well‑estimated SSRT) and antisaccade are the most mechanism‑proximal. They index inhibitory control and, if abnormal by ≥1.5 SD with intact performance‑validity, add weight.
  - Affective variants (emotional Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop) are more on point for “hot” provocation than classic Stroop or WCST. WCST is weakly specific; I would not treat it as core.
  - All are state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation) and vulnerable to effort effects; multiple validity measures and, ideally, retest or cross‑task convergence are essential.

- Stress/toxin markers
  - Historic childhood BLLs are probative of developmental insult if elevated during sensitive windows (and only in conjunction with current executive deficits). They speak to mechanism, not the moment.
  - Hair/diurnal cortisol, HRV, etc. are nonspecific indices of chronic load; one‑off salivary profiles are noisy. Treat them as supportive only.
  - Early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency and FASD risk are similar: mechanism‑supportive when documented contemporaneously, not dispositive.

2) Minimum bundle for clear‑and‑convincing proof of substantial volitional impairment (guilt stage)

I would require all of the following, with no single element sufficient:

A. Reactive event signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; minimal planning; disorganized execution; absence of concealment; contemporaneous corroboration (witness, 911/body‑cam/audio/video) of dissociation/“seeing red”/marked autonomic arousal. If luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental behavior appears, the excuse should presumptively fail.

B. Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- Records predating the offense (school IEPs/discipline, pediatric/ED notes, juvenile files) showing stimulus‑bound rage episodes, dissociation, or impulse‑control failures. This addresses temporality and the “forensic artifact” problem.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- Abnormal performance (≥1.5 SD below norms) on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed; preferably stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence.
- Low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits (e.g., PCL‑R not in the high range), consistent with reactive rather than predatory aggression.

D. Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured, clinician‑established diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored in documented exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and phenomenology of the offense.

E. Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented developmental insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 μg/dL, preferably repeated or a prior ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) that predates and plausibly contributes to the executive deficits now measured.

And all of these exclusions:

- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. If alcohol/drugs were present, the defense must demonstrate baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, or clear instrumental motive defeat the excuse.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral informant checks.

3) Pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, meds can depress test scores and flatten cortisol. Standardize conditions; prefer pre‑charge or pre‑offense records; consider retesting.
- Over‑interpretation of imaging/physiology: fMRI/EEG are not ready for individual adjudication; admit only, if at all, as tertiary support with strict Daubert controls.
- Base‑rate and adversarial bias: broad dispositions (e.g., “diffuse frontal dysfunction”) with weak task specificity; experts over‑relying on self‑report PTSD checklists without collateral corroboration.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense stress can itself alter biomarkers and performance; anchor the causal story in pre‑offense documentation.

4) Legal scaffolding to keep the gate tight

- Rule 702/Daubert hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the bundle above; require defense notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS/school records, housing/EPA, geocoded residence histories).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Consider blinding them, where feasible, to offense outcomes during testing interpretation.
- Offense domain limits: confine to affective/reactive violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime. Impose a temporal proximity guide (e.g., minutes, not hours, from trigger to act).
- Burden/standard: defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) the degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Jury instruction (plain‑language): distinguish intense emotion from impaired capacity; require finding that, because of RSB‑linked conditions, the defendant was unable to refrain in a way that a person with a fair opportunity could.

5) Disposition if excuse established

- Noncarceral ESB conditions (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep interventions, job supports) under court supervision; civil commitment only if the person remains demonstrably dangerous. This protects victims and public safety without the expressive endorsement that worries retributivists.

Bottom line

Santiago’s Stage‑2 elements are directionally sound but must be narrowed: prioritize event‑level reactivity, pre‑offense records, and two mechanism‑proximal tasks with validity; demote WCST and generic Stroop; treat cortisol and imaging as supportive at best; require an objective developmental insult; and police intoxication and instrumentality as disqualifiers. With those guardrails, courts can honor Hart’s fairness limit while avoiding a floodgates problem and preserving jury clarity and public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑1/Stage‑2 framework and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle/pitfalls as given, please translate this into courtroom architecture: (1) what specific pretrial gate (Daubert/Kumho–style) and elements would you require the defense to proffer to earn a jury instruction; (2) the exact jury instruction you’d give on a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse, including burden (clear and convincing?), offense limitations (reactive violence), and categorical disqualifiers (e.g., voluntary intoxication, evident planning); and (3) whether you would bifurcate the dyscontrol question from other issues to avoid prejudice, and how you would handle disposition (ESB vs. commitment) without tainting the guilt phase. Please be concrete—draft language or bullet elements welcome—and flag any parts of the Santiago/Chen criteria you would tighten or drop on administrability/legitimacy grounds.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Two framing points before specifics.

- First, no laboratory or imaging measure can time‑stamp “loss of control” to the moment of the offense. The law will have to infer momentary impairment from converging strands of evidence that show (a) a long‑run susceptibility to reactive dyscontrol and (b) an event signature consistent with that susceptibility being triggered then.
- Second, if we do this at guilt, the gate must be tight, front‑loaded, and rule‑governed, or we will lose administrability and public confidence.

Are the proposed tools up to the task?

- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop/Go–No‑Go) are the best behavioral proxies for inhibitory control. They are not specific to legal insanity, but, with validity checks and stability across sessions, they can show trait‑level deficits plausibly tied to developmental insults.
- WCST is a weak probe of the mechanism at issue and should be de‑emphasized.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic blood‑lead levels (BLLs) are not temporally precise, but they do supply biological plausibility if the timing matches sensitive developmental windows and there is a dose–response relation to present deficits.
- fMRI/EEG: high risk of reverse inference and undue prejudice; at most, supportive. Courts should be skeptical and use Rule 403 to exclude “brain pictures” that add heat but little light.

Minimum bundle for clear and convincing proof

I would require all five of the following, each supported by objective documentation or neutral expert opinion. No single element suffices.

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation after a salient trigger; seconds to minutes, not hours.
- Disorganized execution and lack of instrumental features (no luring, staging, concealment, pursuit of a fleeing victim).
- Contemporaneous observations of dissociation or “seeing red” (911 audio, body‑cam, bystander accounts), with post‑event confusion serving as corroboration but not proof.

2) Pre‑offense history of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense that show explosive reactivity or dissociation (school IEP/discipline, pediatric or ED notes, juvenile probation, prior trauma treatment). This addresses temporality and helps avoid reverse causation from the charge itself.

3) Valid neurocognitive profile consistent with impaired inhibition/affect regulation
- Deficits of at least 1.5 SD below norms on two or more inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), administered by a qualified examiner within 60–90 days of the event, with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and either replication on re‑test or cross‑test convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive rather than predatory aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R, used cautiously).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured diagnostic workup (PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, or closely related) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented exposures and with symptom triggers that plausibly explain the index event. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) are helpful but not mandatory.

5) Objective exposure/insult consistent with mechanism
- At least one developmental insult independently documented before litigation: repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (or a prior peak ≥10), iron‑deficiency/malnutrition markers, FASD risk; or verified chronic sleep deprivation from environmental conditions. Show timing and dose–response with current deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls must be satisfied
- Voluntary intoxication: if acute alcohol/drug effects are the proximate driver, the excuse fails. A history of toxin exposure is different from acute voluntary intoxication.
- Alternative cause exclusion: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, or clear instrumental motives.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures, internal test consistency, and collateral informants. Be alert to “too bad to be true” patterns.
- State–trait control: standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine), consider actigraphy or collateral sleep documentation, and give greater weight to pre‑charge records.

Scientific pitfalls for courts

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, legal stress, or medication changes can depress performance and flatten cortisol; repeat testing or triangulate with pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation: incarceration and litigation can alter biology; hair cortisol can look back several months, but the safest course is contemporaneous or pre‑offense documentation.
- Over‑interpretation of neuroimaging: fMRI/EEG often invite reverse inference from group‑level effects; absent exceptionally rigorous protocols, exclude under Rule 403/702.
- Publication bias/base‑rate error: experts should anchor opinions in meta‑analytic effect sizes and acknowledge heterogeneity; courts should prefer court‑appointed neutrals.

Procedural guardrails

- Notice and proffer: require a structured pretrial proffer tied to the five elements above, with documentary exhibits (medical labs, CPS/school/housing/EPA/UI records) and geocoded exposure history.
- Daubert/Rule 702 hearing with neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health. Courts should appoint and resource neutral experts; otherwise this will be a rich defendant’s defense.
- Offense limitation: confine to truly reactive interpersonal violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive offenses.
- Burden and nexus: defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Jury management and doctrinal channeling

- Where the bundle is met, a narrow excuse instruction should track “substantial incapacity to conform conduct” at the time, not a general character defense. Use special verdict forms to capture findings on each element.
- Where the bundle falls short, channel the same evidence to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance in homicide or to sentencing mitigation. This preserves proportionality without eroding the guilt phase.
- Consider bifurcation: guilt first; if guilty, a responsibility phase for dyscontrol evidence to reduce juror confusion and prejudice.

Disposition

- If excused, impose ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pathways), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain dangerous under existing standards. Incorporate victims’ safety conditions and voice.

In sum: Prof. Santiago’s stage‑two criteria, as tightened by Dr. Chen’s cautions, can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a small subset of reactive cases. But the court must insist on convergence across event signature, pre‑offense records, valid cognitive testing, diagnostic linkage, and objective exposure, and must police the pitfalls—especially intoxication, malingering, and over‑sold neuroscience.

---

### Speaker: Host

You were addressing intoxication when the connection cut. Can you finish that thread with a clear rule of decision? Specifically: when alcohol or drugs are present alongside strong RSB-related exposures, should voluntary intoxication categorically defeat a dyscontrol excuse, or do you favor a mixed‑causation approach? Please propose a principled test (e.g., proximate‑cause allocation, biomarkers/behavioral indicators required to show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication), and specify what burden and types of evidence would be needed to keep the gate tight while not excluding genuinely mixed cases.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

Continuing

- Over-interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI/EEG findings are group‑level and vulnerable to reverse inference; motion, head coil differences, preprocessing choices, and small samples can flip results. They are not time‑of‑offense indices and should be treated as low‑weight, supportive evidence at best.

Additional pitfalls to flag

- Base‑rate and reference‑class errors: Many people with elevated ACEs, prior lead exposure, or executive weaknesses never offend; courts should avoid inferring inevitability from risk factors and anchor conclusions in the index event’s phenomenology.
- Ecological validity of cognitive tasks: Lab tasks capture narrow constructs; poor generalization to complex social provocations is a known limitation. Use them only as one strand in a larger rope of evidence.
- Measurement reliability and norms: Ensure tests use age/sex/education‑appropriate norms validated in the defendant’s linguistic and cultural group; repeat key tasks to check test–retest stability. Hair cortisol varies with hair type/treatments; document and adjust.
- PCL‑R misuse: Treat as a coarse screen, not a dispositive trait label; it can be racially biased and inflated in adversarial settings.
- Multiple comparisons and p‑hacking: Require pre‑specified analysis plans from experts; courts should be wary of post hoc cherry‑picking across many measures.
- Collateral contamination: Post‑offense narratives can converge through suggestion; prioritize contemporaneous records (school, medical, 911/body‑cam) over retrospective testimony.

What “clear and convincing” should look like

I would expect strong alignment on at least four of the five pillars, with the fifth at least neutral/supportive, and no disqualifiers present:

1) Event signature: Objective corroboration (video/911/body‑cam/witness) of rapid, provoked escalation, disorganization, and contemporaneous signs of autonomic arousal or dissociation; no planning/cover‑up.

2) Pre‑offense documentation: Nonforensic records predating the incident that reflect stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school/juvenile mental health/ED visits), and, where possible, longstanding sleep disruption.

3) Neurocognitive profile: ≥1.5 SD deficits on two or more inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), intact performance‑validity indices, and convergence across sessions or measures; low–moderate psychopathic traits consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression.

4) Psychiatric linkage: A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD with dissociative features or Intermittent Explosive Disorder) plausibly mapping triggers/symptoms to the index offense; physiological stress evidence (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective exposure biomarker: Independently documented developmental insult (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; documented FASD risk) temporally preceding and mechanistically linked to current executive deficits.

Mandatory exclusions: substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate cause; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; malingering signals on multiple validity tests; compelling evidence of instrumental planning.

Process safeguards I’d urge courts to apply

- Early, structured Daubert hearing tied to the specified pillars; require defense and prosecution experts to submit pre‑registered analysis plans and disclose raw data for independent review.
- Neutral, court‑appointed experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health to reduce adversarial bias.
- Standardized documentation templates (school/CPS/medical/EPA‑HUD/UI records; geocoded residential histories) and notice requirements.
- Testing conditions control (sleep, meds, caffeine), with repeat key measures where feasible.

Bottom line

These tools cannot “time‑stamp” loss of control. But when the index event unmistakably bears the signature of reactive dyscontrol, and that moment aligns with pre‑existing, independently documented executive‑control vulnerabilities traceable to cumulative adversity and biological insults—and when alternative explanations are credibly excluded—the convergence can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a narrow slice of cases. The court’s job is to insist on that convergence and to treat any single test or biomarker as insufficient on its own.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, from an evidence-and-error-cost perspective, can a trial court realistically implement Santiago/Chen’s dyscontrol gate (the five pillars plus disqualifiers) without devolving into mini‑trials on a defendant’s life history? Please lay out the gatekeeping architecture you would adopt: (i) the scope of a pretrial Daubert hearing (what tests and biomarkers are admissible/inadmissible, and what foundational showings are required); (ii) whether and how to appoint neutral experts; (iii) the burden and standard of proof; and (iv) a short model jury instruction that channels the inquiry to reactive, unplanned violence and requires pre‑offense corroboration. If you would trim or tighten any of the proposed pillars, identify which and why.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen’s cautions: no single laboratory or psychometric finding can “time‑stamp” loss of control. If we are to offer jurors a principled path to excuse, the law should demand a narrow, convergent bundle that ties mechanism, history, and the moment together, and we should cabin the doctrine to truly reactive violence. Here is how I would translate that into a judicially manageable threshold.

1) Offense domain and disqualifiers
- Offense type: limit to affective/reactive violent acts (seconds–minutes after acute provocation). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes and predatory violence.
- Per se disqualifiers:
  - Substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver (absent involuntary ingestion).
  - Evidence of planning/ambush, weapon staging, or concealment.
  - Clear instrumental motive (e.g., retaliation after luring).
  - Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures.
  - Malingering or invalid performance on testing.

2) Minimum convergence (clear and convincing) — five pillars, all required
A. Event signature (moment of offense)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; contemporaneous signs of autonomic arousal/dissociation (“saw red,” “went blank”) corroborated where possible (911/bodycam/CCTV). Post‑event confusion or amnesia may support but is not sufficient.

B. Pre‑offense history (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol: school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, prior ED/clinic notes of dissociation/IED, documented chronic sleep disruption. This anchors traits to pre‑charge life and resists reverse‑causation artifacts.

C. Neurocognitive profile (with validity)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with reliable SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with:
  - Multiple performance‑validity checks (embedded and stand‑alone) passed.
  - Stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence.
- Trait measures consistent with impulsive, not predatory aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in moderate/high range), used cautiously.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage
- Structured clinical diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) plausibly mapping triggers/symptoms to the index event, established by a qualified clinician using validated instruments.
- Supportive, not dispositive: evidence of chronic stress biology (e.g., hair cortisol flattening; low resting HF‑HRV) where feasible and reliable.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independently documented exposure predating adolescence: childhood blood‑lead levels ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or any ≥10), iron‑deficiency/malnutrition with labs, or prenatal alcohol exposure (FASD risk) in medical/CPS records; plus geocoded evidence of hazardous housing or environmental orders where applicable.
- These are not momentary gauges, but when paired with C and D they strengthen causal plausibility.

3) Gatekeeping and procedure
- Notice and proffer: defense files a structured proffer (60–90 days pretrial) tying evidence to each pillar (medical/CPS/school/EPA/HUD/UI records; geocoded histories; testing reports with validity metrics).
- Daubert‑style hearing: court appoints neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Admit fMRI/EEG only as supportive if methodologically sound; never determinative.
- Standardization: require testing conditions control for state confounds (sleep, caffeine, recent meds); consider repeat testing or collateral records where acute jail stress may depress performance.
- Equality safeguards: fund parity for indigent defendants; use normative data appropriate to age/education/language to avoid spurious “deficits.”

4) Scientific pitfalls courts should be alert to
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, legal stress, or medication changes can transiently degrade performance and flatten cortisol. Prefer hair cortisol (3‑month window) over single‑day saliva; corroborate with pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: rely on multiple PVTs; beware selective “Swiss‑cheese” impairment or “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Intoxication: alcohol/stimulants impair inhibition; voluntary use should defeat the excuse even if background vulnerabilities exist (background may still mitigate at sentencing).
- Reverse causation: post‑offense incarceration effects can mimic chronic stress signatures; weight pre‑charge documentation heavily.
- Over‑interpretation: WCST is nonspecific to inhibition; PCL‑R has limits; fMRI is not a lie detector. Downweight glamor; privilege robust, replicated measures (SSRT, antisaccade) with validity checks.
- Biomarker equity: hair cortisol varies with hair characteristics/treatments; interpret cautiously across ethnic groups.

5) Jury instruction (sketch)
- “To find the dyscontrol excuse, you must be clearly convinced that, at the time of the act, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate, affect‑driven impulse was substantially degraded, such that he could not have reasonably complied with the law, and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act. You must not find the excuse if the conduct was planned, instrumental, or primarily caused by voluntary intoxication.”

6) Channeling other cases
- Homicide: if the bundle falls short of excuse, consider MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance as mitigation (imperfect defense).
- All offenses: RSB factors documented in Stage 1 belong at sentencing as structured mitigation tied to verified deprivation indicators (e.g., chronic unemployment, environmental toxins), with problem‑solving/ESB conditions where public safety permits.

7) Disposition after excuse
- Automatism‑like acquittal should remain rare. Where ongoing dangerousness exists, use noncarceral ESB dispositions under court supervision (trauma therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports). Civil commitment is available only if statutory criteria (mental illness plus dangerousness) are met; otherwise, consider legislative authority for supervised ESB in lieu of punitive sanctions.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s framework, refined along Dr. Chen’s lines and bounded by the offense domain and disqualifiers above, can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold without opening floodgates. The law’s fairness limit (Hart) must be applied through tight gates, neutral expertise, and disciplined instructions, with most hard cases channeled to EED or sentencing mitigation rather than full excuse.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume we adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage dyscontrol framework as refined by Dr. Chen. As a gatekeeping judge, please outline a concrete, administrable pretrial protocol: (1) the Rule 702/Daubert checklist you would apply to screen the neurocognitive and biomarker evidence (e.g., SSRT/Go‑No‑Go, affective Stroop, antisaccade, hair cortisol, historic BLLs), including how you’d assess reliability, known error rates, and limits of inference; and (2) a short model jury instruction that defines “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and directs jurors on weighing converging evidence and disqualifiers (planning/cover‑up, voluntary intoxication, malingering). If you would confine the instruction to specified offense categories (e.g., reactive violent crimes), say so and explain why. Keep it specific and operational so a trial court could implement it tomorrow.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

Bottom line. None of the proposed instruments can, standing alone, time‑stamp a loss of control at the moment of the offense. Used together, and only in a narrow class of reactive violence cases, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference that the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply (Hart) because inhibitory control was substantially degraded by long‑run exposures and acutely overwhelmed by a salient trigger. To keep error costs tolerable and the gate governable, I would require a predefined bundle, disqualifiers, and procedural safeguards.

1) Are the tools specific and temporally sensitive enough?
- Neurocognitive tasks. Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with valid SSRT) and antisaccade are the most on‑point for inhibition; affective variants (emotional Go–No‑Go/Stroop) add ecological relevance. Classic Stroop and WCST are too nonspecific to carry much weight. All are state‑sensitive and must be paired with performance‑validity tests and, ideally, replication.
- Stress/exposure markers. Childhood blood‑lead data and other documented developmental insults (IDA, FASD risk) strengthen mechanistic plausibility but do not speak to the precise moment. Diurnal/hair cortisol indicates chronic allostatic load; it is supportive but noisy. None of these is dispositive.
- Event‑level evidence. The most temporally probative evidence remains the offense phenotype: sudden escalation after a salient trigger, disorganized execution, contemporaneous reports of dissociation/“seeing red,” lack of planning or concealment.

Conclusion: As Dr. Chen noted, specificity and temporal precision come from alignment across history, mechanism, and moment, not from any single metric.

2) Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
Require all five pillars; failure on any one defeats the excuse:

A. Event signature (proximate dyscontrol)
- Near‑immediate reaction to a salient provocation; disorganized, short‑horizon conduct; no luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental behavior. Prefer contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/bodycam; witness descriptions of autonomic arousal, “blanking out,” confusion).

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile or ED notes of dissociation/IED, sleep disruption linked to neighborhood violence). This anchors trait‑level vulnerability before litigation.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two validated inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks most tied to the mechanism (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal, antisaccade error rate, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), with intact multiple performance‑validity indicators and cross‑task convergence or replication.
- Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy scores (or equivalent trait measures) to support a reactive, not predatory, profile; use cautiously.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage mapping to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptom content plausibly explaining the index trigger/response and anchored to Stage‑1 exposures. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one biological insult during sensitive periods (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated—or documented IDA/malnutrition or FASD risk), plus a dose‑response story linking that history to current executive deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication proximate to the offense defeats the excuse absent persuasive proof the same dyscontrol occurs sober; in general, treat intoxication as a bar.
- Exclude cases with clear instrumental planning or strong pecuniary motive.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania/TBI as the immediate driver unless the doctrine invoked is a different one (insanity).
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; cross‑source consistency; beware “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Timing: conduct testing as early as feasible and triangulate with pre‑offense records to avoid forensic‑artifact and reverse‑causation problems.

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss, medication changes, withdrawal, or incarceration stress can depress test performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize conditions; obtain actigraphy/sleep collateral; prefer replication and pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain. Use a battery of validity measures; require convergence across tasks hard to feign.
- Acute intoxication. Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; do not let “RSB” smuggle voluntary intoxication back in.
- Reverse causation. Post‑charge stress can mimic chronic stress signatures; hair cortisol can provide a pre‑offense window; historic pediatric/lab/education records are the best antidote.
- Overclaiming from imaging or single biomarkers. fMRI/EEG should be treated, at most, as supportive under Daubert, with known error rates and limited probative value on individual causation.
- Base‑rate neglect and cultural essentialism. Avoid inferring dyscontrol merely from residence in a deprived area; require the full bundle and individualized proof.
- PCL‑R misuse. Do not overread trait instruments; use to help type aggression (reactive vs predatory), not to prove or disprove moral blameworthiness.

4) Doctrinal and procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Narrow offense domain. Confine this excuse to reactive interpersonal violence; channel property/drug offenses to sentencing mitigation.
- Presumptive disqualifiers. Planning/ambush, weapon acquisition, efforts to conceal, and substantial voluntary intoxication defeat the excuse.
- Burden/standard. Defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden on both substantial impairment of inhibitory control and substantial causation in the instant act.
- Pretrial Daubert hearing. Require a structured proffer keyed to the elements above; appoint neutral court experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Limit partisan expert numbers; ensure indigent parity.
- Bifurcation and instruction. Try guilt, then the narrow excuse with a specialized instruction: background alone never excuses; the question is whether, because of documented dyscontrol, the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform at the time of the act. If not proven, RSB may be considered only in mitigation.

5) Disposition (if excuse established)
- ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports) with risk monitoring; reserve civil commitment for those who remain dangerous under existing standards. This respects victims and public safety while avoiding expressive endorsement of violence.

This framework keeps faith with Hart’s fairness limit and Fletcher’s concern for administrability: it makes the doctrine available in the exceptional case where mechanism and moment truly align, and it avoids transforming broad social correlation into case‑level exculpation.

---

### Speaker: Host

Building on Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, could you translate this into a courtroom gate and instruction? Specifically: (i) what would your Daubert/Kumho pretrial admissibility order require (minimum converging showings, neutral experts, exclusion of intoxication-based claims, and standardization of tests); and (ii) what short, rule-governed jury instruction would you give to confine the excuse to reactive violence and require clear-and-convincing proof that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and was a substantial contributing cause of the act? Please be concrete—propose model language and note any limiting principles you’d add to keep this administrable and equal-access.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

Short answer: none of the proposed measures can time‑stamp loss of control; they are probative only in convergence. Used within a narrow, reactive‑violence domain and vetted under Rule 702/Daubert, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment in a small class of cases.

What these tools can and cannot do
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go; antisaccade; affective Stroop/flanker) index inhibitory control and affective interference. They are sensitive at the group level; they are not specific to “legal dyscontrol” and are state‑susceptible (sleep, anxiety, meds, motivation). WCST is least germane (set‑shifting) and should be down‑weighted.
- Stress/toxin markers (historic childhood BLLs; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; hair/diurnal cortisol) establish mechanistic plausibility and chronic load, not moment‑of‑offense impairment. fMRI should not be used to prove individual causation; at most, it is weakly corroborative.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing), plus exclusions
Admissibility should be conditioned on all of A–D and at least one item in E, with disqualifiers in F. No single element suffices.

A) Event‑level signature (core)
- Affective/reactive episode: near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; no luring/staging/cover‑up. Corroboration via witnesses/video/911/body‑cam; contemporaneous descriptions (“went blank,” “saw red”), autonomic signs.

B) Pre‑offense documentation (core)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, prior ED/mental‑health notes, juvenile records). Establish temporality.

C) Neurocognitive evidence with validity (core)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below demographically corrected norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal, antisaccade error rate, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), replicated or cross‑test convergent.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) intact; low–moderate trait psychopathy (to distinguish reactive from predatory profiles). Consider delay‑discounting as supportive.

D) Structured clinical linkage (core)
- Diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician using structured instruments; symptom content and triggers plausibly map onto the index event; longitudinal consistency with B.

E) Objective exposure/physiological corroboration (at least one)
- Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or any ≥10) during sensitive windows; or documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency; or well‑documented FASD risk; or chronic sleep disruption tied to environmental stressors (with collateral/actigraphy); or hair cortisol pattern consistent with chronic load. These are plausibility anchors, not time stamps, but I would strongly prefer at least one “hard” indicator independent of litigation.

F) Disqualifiers/alternative‑cause controls (all required)
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (positive tox generally defeats the excuse absent compelling baseline evidence and minimal levels).
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, and instrumental motives (planning, gain).
- Guard against malingering: consistency across sessions, collateral informants, and PVTs; beware “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, detention stress, medication changes depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; test early (30–60 days) and corroborate with pre‑offense records; prefer hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) over single‑day salivary profiles.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity indices; repeat or cross‑validate when feasible.
- Acute intoxication: separate developmental toxin history (lead, FASD) from proximate alcohol/drug effects.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: incarceration and litigation themselves alter physiology and test performance—hence the premium on pre‑charge documentation.
- Over‑interpretation/cherry‑picking: avoid overreliance on WCST, seductive fMRI images, or single abnormal scores; watch base rates and multiple‑comparison error; use demographically corrected norms to reduce cultural/education bias.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and equity)
- Pretrial Daubert hearing tied to a structured proffer addressing A–F; appoint neutral court experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Standardized proof templates (geocoded residence/exposure maps; verified medical/CPS/school/UI/EPA/HUD records) with chain‑of‑custody.
- Offense domain: confine to reactive violent offenses (and only the rare truly impulsive nonviolent act); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden: clear and convincing on substantial degradation of inhibitory control and its substantial contribution to the act.
- Bifurcation and instructions: separate guilt from excuse; give a tightly drafted instruction defining “loss of self‑control” as acts not the product of the actor’s conscious effort or determination, not self‑induced by voluntary intoxication, and temporally tied to an acute provocation.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 elements are directionally sound if used as a convergence framework and paired with strict exclusions. Courts should demand the four cores (event signature, pre‑offense history, valid inhibitory deficits, structured diagnosis) plus at least one objective exposure marker, and should be unforgiving about intoxication, planning, and malingering. That keeps error costs tolerable and preserves public legitimacy while leaving most RSB work to sentencing and ESB‑oriented dispositions.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming we adopt a narrowly tailored RSB dyscontrol excuse along the Santiago–Chen convergence model, please draft a model jury instruction you would actually give. Specify: (1) the defendant’s burden (e.g., clear and convincing); (2) the elements the jury must find (reactive, unplanned event; substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time; causal contribution from documented RSB exposures); (3) explicit exclusions (voluntary intoxication as proximate driver, instrumental/planned conduct, malingering); and (4) guidance on how to weigh expert testing versus pre‑offense records and eyewitness/event‑level evidence. Keep it tight and administrable.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally right, but courts must translate it into a tight, administrable gate under Rule 702/Daubert. None of the listed instruments can, standing alone, time‑stamp loss of control; the law must demand convergence plus a fit to a legally recognized excusing framework (involuntary act/automatism or, in homicide, MPC‑style EED), not a free‑floating “dyscontrol” umbrella.

What is probative
- Event‑level signature (highest weight):
  - Rapid, affective escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; absence of luring/precaution; contemporaneous lay observations of “blanking out,” autonomic arousal; preferably video/911/body‑cam corroboration.
- Pre‑offense, nonforensic record of stimulus‑bound loss of control:
  - School/juvenile mental‑health records, ED visits, IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity or dissociation; sleep disturbance documentation predating the offense.
- Neurocognitive testing (with validity checks) targeting inhibition/affect regulation:
  - Require ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go [SSRT], antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), with intact embedded/stand‑alone PVTs and stability across sessions.
  - Downweight WCST (set‑shifting, nonspecific); use Stroop only as part of a battery.
  - Trait psychopathy measures (e.g., PCL‑R) should be used cautiously and never as a gate.
- Diagnosed, task‑relevant disorder:
  - Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptoms plausibly map onto the index event; anchored to pre‑offense records rather than post‑charge report alone.
- Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism:
  - Childhood lead history (ideally repeated BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, with any ≥10 µg/dL persuasive), FASD risk, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition or similar developmental insults documented independent of litigation. These are not momentary indicators; they bolster causal plausibility when paired with current inhibitory deficits.

Stress measures
- Cortisol: single‑day salivary profiles are noisy; hair cortisol (3‑cm) offers a 3‑month window and is modestly supportive of chronic stress. Treat as corroborative only.
- HRV/startle may support affect‑regulation impairment but should not drive the finding.
- fMRI/EEG: generally more prejudicial than probative in this niche; admit, if at all, only as tertiary support with a limiting instruction.

Minimum bundle for clear and convincing (all required)
1) Event signature consistent with reactive, not instrumental, aggression.
2) Pre‑offense documentation of episodic dyscontrol (nonforensic).
3) Neurocognitive evidence: ≥2 convergent inhibition deficits with valid effort and cross‑session/cross‑test stability.
4) Clinically established, mechanism‑consistent diagnosis mapping to the event.
5) At least one documented developmental biological insult consistent with executive control vulnerability.

And all disqualifiers must be absent
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate cause (defense fails).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures (different doctrine).
- Strong planning/goal‑directed features (luring, weapon staging, concealment).
- Malingering/secondary gain (failed PVTs, implausible profiles).

Key scientific/legal pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Prefer pre‑offense records; standardize test conditions; replicate where feasible.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: overreliance on post‑charge testing; insist on pre‑charge documentation and independent exposure records (CPS, schools, HUD/EPA, pediatrics).
- Malingering: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; look for consistency across tasks/sessions and with collateral reports.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: population links (lead, ACEs) do not prove individual causation without the event‑level and neurocognitive pieces.
- Test selection/misuse: WCST/PCL‑R overreach; cultural/educational bias in testing; ensure qualified neuropsychologists with forensic experience administer and interpret.
- Intoxication spillover: alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; the doctrine should not excuse that proximate driver.

Procedural safeguards to preserve administrability and legitimacy
- Pretrial Daubert/Kumho hearing with a structured proffer tied to the five‑pillar bundle; appoint neutral experts (Rule 706) in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (geocoded exposure histories; certified school/CPS/medical/HUD/EPA/UI records); hearsay exceptions for business/public records to avoid mini‑trials on authenticity.
- Offense‑domain limit: channel to reactive violent offenses; planned acquisitive crime presumptively excluded. In homicide, consider channeling to MPC §210.3 EED where dyscontrol is substantial but short of automatism.
- Bifurcation and interrogatories: use special verdict questions (e.g., “Did the defendant prove by clear and convincing evidence that the act was involuntary/unconscious?”) to cabin jury nullification and preserve review.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; without it, the doctrine becomes class‑skewed and illegitimate.

Bottom line
The proposed batteries and markers are not temporally precise; taken together—aligned with the event and grounded in pre‑offense records—they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow band of cases. Courts should treat this as a rule‑governed, automatism‑like excuse (and EED in homicide), not a generalized “RSB made me do it” defense. That keeps error costs and floodgates in check while honoring Hart’s fairness limit: no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, could you draft concrete model jury instruction language for a narrowly tailored dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse at the guilt phase? Please specify: (i) the elements the jury must find (including the “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and causation to the instant act); (ii) the defendant’s burden (e.g., clear and convincing); and (iii) categorical disqualifiers (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, significant planning/cover‑up, primary psychosis unrelated to RSB). Also indicate whether you would require bifurcation and a special verdict form, and how you would phrase limiting language to prevent the jury from treating deprivation as a justification rather than an excuse.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

1) Are the proposed tools specific and time‑sensitive enough?
- Bottom line: No single measure can time‑stamp loss of control. Several are probative in combination.
- Neurocognitive tasks
  - Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with valid SSRT estimates): the most mechanism‑proximal for inhibition; still state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation).
  - Affective variants (emotional Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop) are more relevant to “hot” reactive aggression than classic Stroop or WCST. WCST is least specific to inhibition; I would downweight it.
  - All testing must include multiple performance‑validity tests and, ideally, replication or cross‑test convergence.
- Stress/toxin markers
  - Historic childhood blood lead levels (BLLs): strong developmental mechanism evidence; not moment‑specific but valuable if elevations occurred in sensitive windows.
  - Hair cortisol (3 cm) is superior to single‑day salivary profiles for chronic load; still non‑specific and affected by hair treatments/ethnicity.
  - Early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition/FASD risk are supportive background insults; not moment‑level.
- Imaging: Functional MRI lacks forensic reliability for individual attribution; I would admit only, if at all, as background education, not proof.

2) Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold
Require convergence across independent domains, with no single pillar sufficient. I would require all of (A)–(C) and at least one of (D) or (E), plus the absence of disqualifiers:

A. Index‑event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized act; no luring/staging/cover‑up; contemporaneous evidence (video/bodycam/911/witnesses) of “blanking out,” “seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal. If planning or instrumental post‑event behavior is present, the excuse should presumptively fail.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (non‑forensic)
- School/juvenile/clinical records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound explosions, dissociation, or similar; sleep disruption tied to neighborhood stressors; not merely post‑charge reports.

C. Neuropsychological evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below demographically‑corrected norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), intact effort indices, and either replication or cross‑test convergence. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy scores to support an impulsive, not predatory, profile (used cautiously).

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index event.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or any ≥10), or documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia/FASD risk; these strengthen causality when paired with current inhibition deficits.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one may defeat the excuse)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver.
- Strong evidence of planning/instrumental motive.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures.
- Malingering/invalid testing (failed PVTs, inconsistency).
- High psychopathic trait profile suggesting predatory aggression.

3) Scientific pitfalls and how courts should handle them
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, acute stress, medication changes can depress performance and cortisol. Prefer early testing (within 30–60 days), standardized conditions, and replication; lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; watch for selective “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; the doctrine should not excuse voluntary intoxication. The defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute substance effects.
- Reverse causation: Post‑offense incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and affect testing. Hair cortisol segments that pre‑date the offense and historic pediatric/school records mitigate this.
- Demographic/education effects: Use demographically corrected norms and interpret low global ability carefully; look for the pattern (hot‑inhibition deficits) rather than across‑the‑board low scores.
- PCL‑R misuse: Treat as one data point; avoid over‑reliance or cultural overreach.
- Base‑rate neglect: Jurors may over‑weight “brain” evidence; clear limiting instructions are essential (supportive, not determinative).

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tied to a structured checklist reflecting the bundle above.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS/school/housing/EPA, geocoded histories).
- Limit domain to reactive interpersonal violence (and rare truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) capacity to conform conduct was substantially degraded and (ii) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants, or the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

5) Jury instruction and disposition
- Instruction should emphasize “substantial impairment of capacity to conform” at the time, not mere difficulty, bad temper, or general poverty.
- If excused, channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions under court supervision; reserve civil commitment for those remaining demonstrably dangerous.

Set this gate high. The error costs of false positives are significant for victims and public legitimacy. With the convergence and exclusions above, the class of successful cases should remain small and tightly linked to the top tail of cumulative adversity where mechanism and moment genuinely line up.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, focusing on administrability: given Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage eligibility/attribution framework and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence, please sketch the concrete procedural architecture you would adopt. Specifically: (1) What should a Daubert‑style pretrial hearing test for admissibility decide as a matter of law versus reserve for the jury as fact? (2) Who bears which burdens at which stage (e.g., preponderance at admissibility; clear‑and‑convincing at guilt), and would you require court‑appointed neutral experts? (3) Would you bifurcate with a special verdict on a “reactive dyscontrol excuse,” and limit the doctrine categorically to reactive violence? (4) Draft the core of a model jury instruction that captures Hart’s “no fair opportunity to comply” limit without inviting nullification, and indicates how jurors should weigh event‑signature evidence versus neurocognitive findings. (5) Identify bright‑line legal disqualifiers (e.g., evidence of planning, voluntary intoxication above a threshold) that should bar the defense as a matter of law. (6) Finally, what resource/funding and records‑access orders would you mandate to prevent wealth‑based inequities in mounting or contesting this excuse?

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally sound if the doctrine is confined to a narrow, involuntary‑rage/automatism lane. As a matter of evidence law and administrability, none of the proposed measures can, standing alone, prove loss of control “at the moment.” Under Rule 702/Daubert, they can “fit” as supportive science if the court insists on convergence plus a strong event‑level signature and excludes obvious alternative drivers. I would adopt a mandatory bundle with categorical disqualifiers, and channel most other RSB work to sentencing or, in homicide, to MPC‑style EED.

Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard (guilt‑phase excuse)

Require all three mandatory pillars and at least one corroborator:

Mandatory pillars
1) Event signature of reactive automatism
- Acute provocation; seconds‑to‑minutes latency; brief, disorganized episode; no luring or staging; no concealment or post‑event instrumental steps.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam/witness) of dissociation (“went blank/seeing red”), autonomic arousal, confusion. If planning/cover‑up is present, the excuse fails.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive outbursts, pediatric/ED notes, juvenile probation/mental health notes) evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control or dissociation. This answers temporality and guards against reverse‑causation.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity safeguards
- At least two inhibitory/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD impaired (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with reliable SSRT; antisaccade; an affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop variant), plus intact performance‑validity testing (embedded and stand‑alone). Prefer replication or cross‑test convergence; down‑weight WCST. Low–moderate psychopathic trait profile (to support reactive, not predatory, aggression).

Corroborators (at least one)
- Objective exposure biomarker consistent with developmental insult (historical childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a peak ≥10; or iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; or well‑documented FASD risk), independent of litigation.
- Physiological stress marker consistent with chronic load (hair cortisol pattern; low resting HF‑HRV), used as supportive only.
- Structured clinical diagnosis mapping to the event (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), established by a qualified clinician with structured instruments, anchored to documented exposures and triggers relevant to the index act.

Categorical disqualifiers and controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse; the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute substance effects.
- Evidence of planning, instrumental motive, or post‑event concealment defeats the excuse.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the incident; or malingering (failed PVTs or “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles) defeats the excuse.
- Testing should occur promptly (ideally within 45–90 days) and be interpreted alongside pre‑offense records to minimize forensic artifact.

Daubert/Frye guardrails
- Admit inhibitory control tasks as supportive; they have known error characteristics and general acceptance for indexing inhibition, not for “time‑stamping” volition. They cannot carry the burden alone.
- Treat hair/diurnal cortisol and historic BLLs as plausibility/causality anchors (temporality, dose‑response), not moment‑of‑offense proof.
- fMRI/advanced imaging should be presumptively excluded at guilt (risk of neuro‑hype/poor forensic specificity); if admitted in rare cases, it must be strictly limited and corroborative.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized proffer templates; notice requirements.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: sleep deprivation, acute stress, medication effects can depress test performance and cortisol. Standardize conditions; prefer repeated or corroborated testing; rely on pre‑offense documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple PVTs; look for internal consistency and cross‑source corroboration; beware selective impairment confined to easy‑to‑feign tasks.
- Acute intoxication: common and highly confounding; keep the intoxication bar bright.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑arrest stress flattens cortisol and degrades performance; hair cortisol offers a pre‑offense window; pre‑charge school/medical records are the antidote.
- Base‑rate neglect/neuro‑realism: many disadvantaged individuals show similar test patterns without losing control; juries need limiting instructions that these findings are not determinative.

Narrowing the offense domain and process
- Limit the excuse to truly reactive violent offenses (and a very small class of impulsive, nonviolent acts with the same signature). Planned acquisitive crimes should be presumptively out.
- Bifurcate: decide the excuse in a focused phase with tailored instructions, to preserve jury focus and legitimacy.
- Burden: defendant must prove substantial degradation of inhibitory control that substantially caused the act by clear and convincing evidence.

Dispositions
- If excused, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision (trauma‑focused care; housing relocation from criminogenic contexts; nutrition/sleep interventions; employment support). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

Bottom line
Used this way—as a tightly rule‑governed automatism/dyscontrol doctrine—Stage 2 evidence can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold only when mechanism, history, and moment line up and disqualifiers are absent. Anything broader risks turning juries into epidemiologists, invites unequal application, and burdens the very communities we aim to protect. Keeping the gate narrow, the instructions crisp, and the proof convergent answers the moral concern—Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit—without opening the floodgates.

### Speaker: Host

You were outlining pitfalls when the science moves from correlation to case-level attribution. Can you finish by addressing two in particular—reverse causation (forensic testing and post-charge stress depressing performance) and gene–environment interplay—and then give the court a realistic sense of error rates if we adopt Prof. Santiago’s five‑pillar bundle (i.e., where the false‑positive and false‑negative risks are likely to sit)?

---

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

…over-interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI, EEG, and structural MRI are group‑level research tools with poor individual‑diagnostic specificity; they are highly sensitive to analytic choices and motion artifacts and should be treated, at most, as supportive context. Do not let colorful images substitute for functional evidence of impaired control.

Additional cautions and recommendations
- Base‑rate and circularity problems: Executive deficits are common among justice‑involved populations. Courts should avoid “deficit = excuse” shortcuts and require the full causal chain (exposure → trait‑like impairment → event‑level dyscontrol).
- Ecological validity: Lab tasks capture narrow constructs; insist on corroboration from real‑world behavior (school/employment/clinical histories).
- Cross‑cultural psychometrics: Use appropriate norms and language accommodations; low education or ESL status can depress scores independent of dyscontrol.
- Adversarial allegiance: Prefer court‑appointed, independent experts; consider blind review of raw data and pre‑specified analytic plans to limit cherry‑picking.
- Genetics: Polygenic scores or single‑gene claims are not forensically ready and risk essentialism; I would exclude them.
- Timing protocols: Standardize testing conditions (sleep, caffeine, meds), document them, and, where practicable, repeat key tasks to assess stability.

A workable evidentiary bundle (clear and convincing)
I would require all of the following, with no disqualifiers:
1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol (rapid provocation‑to‑act, disorganization, no planning/cover‑up), preferably corroborated by contemporaneous audio/video or multiple neutral witnesses.
2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol episodes in nonforensic records (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, prior ED/clinic notes).
3) Neurocognitive evidence of inhibition/affect‑regulation deficits (≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition‑relevant tasks) with intact performance validity and either replication across sessions or cross‑task convergence; low psychopathic trait profile to fit a reactive (not predatory) pattern.
4) A clinically established, exposure‑anchored diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype or IED) whose symptom triggers plausibly map onto the index event; biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol) are supportive but optional.
5) At least one objectively documented developmental biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, well‑documented FASD risk) that temporally precedes and plausibly contributes to the measured deficits.

And none of these disqualifiers:
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures.
- Strong evidence of instrumental planning or motive.
- Unresolved malingering concerns (failed multiple PVTs).
- Testing performed so late or under such abnormal state conditions that results are uninterpretable, without corroborating pre‑offense records.

Causality scaffolding the court can weigh
- Dose–response: higher early BLLs or ACEs correlating with worse inhibition in the same person.
- Temporality: exposures and dyscontrol documented before the offense.
- Negative controls: sibling or cohort comparisons where records allow (recognizing shared‑environment limits).
- Natural experiments in the record: e.g., documented lead abatement timelines, school desegregation/finance reforms overlapping the defendant’s development.

Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tied to a standardized checklist; require raw data disclosure.
- Neutral expert pool (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); allow the court to appoint a primary examiner.
- Notice and documentary proof templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA, unemployment records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; without it, the doctrine will be inequitable.
- If the bundle falls short of clear and convincing, courts should still admit the same evidence at sentencing for structured mitigation.

Bottom line
These measures are not clocks that time‑stamp loss of control, but, when aligned—history, mechanism, and moment—they can support a high‑confidence inference of substantial volitional impairment in a narrow class of reactive offenses. Courts should demand that alignment, stay vigilant for state–trait confounds, malingering, intoxication, and reverse causation, and channel close cases to mitigation rather than excuse. Dispositions should prioritize ESB interventions under supervision, with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

---

### Speaker: Host

Your assessment was cut off after noting acute intoxication. Please complete it by focusing on two things: (1) reverse causation and gene–environment correlation—how much do these undermine case-level inference, and what specific evidence patterns would alleviate those concerns? (2) two or three concrete courtroom guardrails to neutralize the main scientific pitfalls you identified (e.g., standardized testing protocols and timing, replication, neutral-expert roles), so judges have a practical checklist for Daubert and jury presentation.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

Thank you. Let me finish and sharpen the edges around specificity, timing, and error risks.

Further scientific pitfalls courts should police

- Over-interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI/EEG/structural MRI show group-level associations; single‑case diagnosticity is weak. Scanner/protocol heterogeneity, circular ROI selection, and analytic flexibility can yield false positives. Treat imaging as, at most, supportive context—not a determinant.
- Base-rate and specificity problems: Many people with executive deficits or flattened cortisol never commit violent acts; deficits are neither necessary nor sufficient for reactive assault. Event‑level features must carry the weight.
- Cultural/test‑norm bias: Executive tasks and symptom instruments can under- or over‑pathologize depending on education, language, and cultural background. Use demographically appropriate norms and qualified bilingual assessors where relevant.
- State–trait and comorbidity confounds: ADHD, past TBI, sleep deprivation, acute stress, and medication status can depress inhibitory task performance; document and, where possible, model their contributions.
- Memory/phenomenology reliability: Post‑hoc reports of “seeing red” or amnesia are susceptible to suggestion and self‑serving bias. Weight contemporaneous evidence (911 calls, bodycam, immediately recorded witness accounts) over retrospective narratives.
- Publication/confirmation bias: Experts can “connect the dots” given a broad canvas of adversity. Pre‑specify criteria, require independent corroboration, and scrutinize adversarial allegiance effects.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition acutely; voluntary intoxication is typically non‑exculpatory. Distinguish developmental neurotoxins (e.g., childhood lead) from momentary substance effects at the index event.

What minimum convergence should clear “clear and convincing”?

I would insist on all five pillars below, plus the disqualifiers/controls, before a jury instruction on a dyscontrol excuse:

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized, unplanned behavior; contemporaneous autonomic signs or third‑party descriptions of dissociation; ideally video/911/body‑cam corroboration.
- Absence of planning (weapon staging, luring) and post‑event concealment.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School, pediatric, juvenile justice, or clinical records predating the offense documenting stimulus‑bound rage episodes, dissociation, or explosive outbursts; sleep disruption patterns consistent with chronic arousal.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity and cross‑task convergence
- ≥1.5 SD impairments on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/SSRT and antisaccade or affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), intact performance‑validity indices, and either replication across sessions or corroboration with historical records.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (not predatory) aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R; interpret cautiously).

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the incident
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented exposures; symptom triggers plausibly match the index event. Chronic stress marker (e.g., hair cortisol) supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or one ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk) that temporally precedes and plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Toxicology and timing: exclude cases where substantial voluntary intoxication is the proximate driver; standardize testing conditions; prefer hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) over single‑day salivary profiles.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral informants.
- Alternative cause exclusion: primary psychosis/mania (unless independently tied to RSB exposures under a different doctrine), acute TBI at offense, clear instrumental motives.

Are the proposed measures specific and time‑sensitive enough?

- Specificity: Individually, no. As a convergent bundle aligned with the event’s phenomenology and pre‑offense records, they can raise the probability of substantial volitional impairment into the “highly likely” range for a narrow subset of cases.
- Temporal sensitivity: None of these tools “time‑stamp” impairment to the moment; that inference must rest on the event signature plus pre‑offense trajectory. Courts should be wary when all impairment evidence is generated post‑charge with no historical corroboration.

Process safeguards to reduce error costs

- Pretrial Daubert hearing with pre‑specified criteria; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Standardized evidentiary templates (geocoded exposure histories; school/CPS/medical/EPA/UI records).
- Require early testing (ideally ≤60–90 days) and, where feasible, retest to assess stability; use demographically appropriate norms.
- Clear jury instruction: the defense must prove (i) substantially degraded inhibitory control and (ii) that such degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act, independent of voluntary intoxication.

How to handle close calls

- If pillars 1–2 are solid but 3–5 are mixed or equivocal, channel the evidence to mitigation rather than a full excuse.
- Reserve the excuse for cases where mechanism, history, and moment line up; otherwise, use structured sentencing mitigation tied to verified deprivation/toxin exposure with ESB‑oriented conditions.

Bottom line

The science can credibly support a tightly circumscribed dyscontrol excuse when multiple independent lines—event‑level features, pre‑offense dyscontrol history, convergent inhibitory deficits with validity checks, a fitting psychiatric formulation, and at least one developmental biological insult—align, and obvious alternative drivers are excluded. Anything less belongs at sentencing. This preserves Hart’s fairness limit, respects victims, and keeps the gate narrow enough to avoid floodgates while directing successful cases to ESB‑focused, noncarceral dispositions that reduce recurrence.

---

### Speaker: Host

Given Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, please draft a model jury instruction for a narrowly tailored dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse. Keep it focused and rule‑like: (i) the elements the defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence; (ii) the permissible evidentiary anchors (event signature, pre‑offense records, neurocognitive deficits with validity checks, documented biological insult); and (iii) explicit disqualifiers (planned/instrumental crime, substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate cause, malingering). Aim for an instruction that minimizes moralizing, steers jurors away from punishing poverty simpliciter, and cabins the excuse to reactive violence. Provide the text you’d put in a standard criminal jury charge.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Big picture. Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally right: no single instrument can “time‑stamp” loss of control, but a convergent bundle tied to the event can justify an excuse in a very small class of reactive cases. The court’s job is to (i) keep the science in its lane (trait risk vs momentary loss), (ii) insist on pre‑offense corroboration, and (iii) confine applicability to affective, unplanned violence. Administerability and error costs should drive the design.

Are the proposed tools specific/temporal enough?
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go; antisaccade; affective Go‑No‑Go) index inhibitory control with moderate validity. They are trait‑leaning and state‑sensitive; they cannot by themselves prove momentary dyscontrol.
- Stroop and WCST are less specific to inhibition; I would downweight or drop WCST.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic blood lead levels are supportive of mechanism and temporality (developmental insult/chronic stress) but nonspecific to the moment.
- Conclusion: admissible as part of a convergent package; never dispositive.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing (all must be satisfied)
1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Acute provocation with short latency (seconds to a few minutes).
- Disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment.
- Contemporaneous corroboration of dissociation/“seeing red” (911/body‑cam/witness), not just post hoc self‑report.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity; prior ED/clinic notes; juvenile records). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity safeguards
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD impaired (e.g., Stop‑Signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go), with:
  - Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone), and
  - Cross‑session or cross‑test stability to blunt state noise (sleep, meds).
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive—not predatory—aggression (use PCL‑R cautiously; avoid overreliance).

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptoms and triggers plausibly explaining the index act and anchored to pre‑offense exposures. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol) is supportive, not required.

5) Objective developmental/biological insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑offense documentation of at least one: repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (or single ≥10), early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or documented FASD risk. The point is to show a plausible pathway by which control systems were degraded.

And disqualifiers/controls that defeat the excuse
- Voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (alcohol/stimulants) defeats the defense absent persuasive proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Strong evidence of planning or instrumental motive.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures (that is a different doctrine).
- Malingering flags (failed validity testing; “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles).
- Testing conducted only post‑charge with no pre‑offense corroboration.

Scientific pitfalls and how courts should manage them
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress depress performance and cortisol. Mitigate with standardized testing conditions, repetition, and heavy weight on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Require multiple performance‑validity indices; compel disclosure of raw data; appoint neutral examiners.
- Acute intoxication: Distinguish chronic toxin history (lead) from voluntary substance use at the event; the latter generally bars excuse.
- Reverse causation: Post‑offense stress can flatten cortisol and affect tests; hair cortisol (pre‑offense segment) and historical labs/school records help.
- “Neuro‑dazzle”: fMRI/EEG should be admitted, if at all, only as supportive and subject to Daubert scrutiny (known error rates, standards, general acceptance). Do not let colorful images substitute for event‑level proof.
- PCL‑R misuse: It is not a violence litmus test and has known biases; use sparingly to exclude predatory profiles, not to prove the defense.

Procedural and doctrinal guardrails (administrability/public legitimacy)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; failure on any prong defeats the excuse (but evidence remains available for sentencing mitigation).
- Narrow offense domain: reactive interpersonal violence with short latency; presumptive exclusion of planned acquisitive crimes.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions: define “substantial impairment” as a marked degradation of the capacity to inhibit an otherwise intended act at the time of offense, not due primarily to voluntary intoxication, such that the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform (Hart’s limit). Instruct jurors not to treat socioeconomic adversity alone as exculpatory.
- Indigency parity: fund testing and record collection for indigent defendants or the doctrine will be both under‑inclusive and unequal.

In sum: use the tests/markers as corroboration, not anchors; insist on contemporaneous event features and pre‑offense documentation; and keep the channel narrow. That preserves what is morally attractive here—the fairness limit—without sacrificing administrability or respect for victims.

---

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and evidentiary law perspective, would you make a documented developmental biological insult (e.g., elevated childhood BLLs, FASD, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition) a necessary element of any dyscontrol‑RSB excuse, or allow cases to proceed on social deprivation + neurocognitive/phenomenological evidence alone? Please sketch the precise gatekeeping order you’d issue at a Daubert‑style hearing: the minimum required showings (and disqualifiers) you would impose before the jury ever hears it, and one or two key pattern‑instruction sentences you’d give to frame “substantial impairment” without sliding into a de facto justification. 

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly in accord with Dr. Chen: none of these instruments can “time‑stamp” loss of control; the law will only get to clear and convincing if it insists on convergence across mechanism, history, and the moment. From an evidence-and-administrability standpoint, here is what I would treat as both necessary and sufficient—and what I would exclude.

1) Minimum converging bundle (all five required)
- Event signature (indispensable): Credible, preferably contemporaneous evidence that the offense was reactive and disorganized (rapid escalation after a salient trigger; no luring or staging; immediate autonomic arousal; body‑cam/911/witness descriptions of “seeing red,” blanking, or dissociation). Any meaningful planning or cover‑up should presumptively defeat the excuse.
- Pre‑offense history (indispensable): Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile clinical notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits, documented chronic sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and avoids post‑charge artifact.
- Neurocognitive impairment with validity (core): At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below age‑normed means (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), administered with multiple performance‑validity tests and standardized conditions; cross‑test convergence or repeatability preferred. WCST I would downweight; classic Stroop is supportive only. Trait measures should not contradict an impulsive/reactive profile (avoid moderate‑high psychopathy).
- Clinical linkage (core): A structured DSM‑5 diagnosis that maps to the index event (PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), established by a qualified clinician with standardized instruments and anchored to documented exposures; biological corroborants (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) are supportive but not required.
- Objective exposure biomarker or equivalent record (core, developmental): Independent documentation of at least one biologically plausible insult during sensitive periods (childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated—or ≥10 once; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk), or verified chronic environmental stressors (lead hazard orders, HUD/EPA records, repeated evictions, prolonged homelessness) that plausibly contribute to present executive deficits.

2) Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause screens (any one defeats)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause of the act.
- Primary psychosis/mania not traceable to the documented RSB exposures.
- Malingering or invalid testing (failed PVTs; inconsistent profiles).
- Clear instrumental motive or planning inconsistent with reactive dyscontrol.

3) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, acute incarceration stress, meds. Prefer early testing (within 30–60 days), standardized conditions, and corroboration with pre‑offense records; consider actigraphy or collateral sleep documentation where feasible.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance; hair cortisol (3‑month window) and historical pediatric/education records help anchor timing.
- Overclaiming from weak or nonspecific markers: WCST, classic Stroop, single‑day salivary cortisol are low‑specificity; treat as ancillary. fMRI should be excluded or heavily cabined under Rules 403/702—high risk of prejudice, low incremental probative value for the legal question.
- Performance validity: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; repeat or cross‑validate when feasible.

4) Daubert/702 gatekeeping and process
- Pretrial Rule 104(a) hearing keyed to a structured proffer; insist on the five‑pillar showing above and on standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD, unemployment records; geocoded exposure history).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health to blunt partisanship and “culture shopping.”
- Timeliness: absent good cause, late testing should be discounted; pre‑offense documentation is the fulcrum of reliability.

5) Offense domain and burden
- Limit the excuse to reactive violent offenses (and the rare truly impulsive nonviolent act). Planned acquisitive crime is presumptively out.
- Place on the defense a clear‑and‑convincing burden to prove (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

6) Jury management
- Special verdict interrogatories tracking the elements (reactive event; pre‑offense history; neurocognitive impairment with validity; clinical linkage; exposure biomarker; exclusion of alternatives).
- Limit experts from opining on the ultimate legal conclusion (“no fair opportunity”); they should describe impairments, not declare legal irresponsibility.

Disposition
If the excuse carries, channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions with judicial supervision (trauma‑focused treatment, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous under ordinary standards. If the gate is not met, RSB belongs at sentencing as structured mitigation.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 menu is directionally sound if we (a) pare back nonspecific tests, (b) elevate pre‑offense documentation and event‑level proof, (c) require validity safeguards, and (d) keep the offense domain narrow. Done that way, the doctrine remains rare, principled, and governable—honoring Hart’s fairness limit without inviting floodgates.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assume the jurisdiction adopts a narrow dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse along the lines Prof. Santiago outlined and Dr. Chen refined. From an administrability standpoint, what precise gatekeeping order would you have trial judges issue at a pretrial hearing, and what concise jury instruction would you give if the case proceeds? Please specify: (i) the defendant’s burden and elements; (ii) the permissible evidentiary categories; (iii) clear disqualifiers (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, planning/instrumentality); and (iv) the exact causation language (“substantial degradation of inhibitory control” etc.). Aim for language tight enough to guide busy courts and avoid floodgates.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally sound but, as Dr. Chen notes, no single assay can “time‑stamp” loss of control. Courts should demand tight convergence and exclude cases where the story looks instrumental. If we are to let a dyscontrol excuse reach a jury at all, I would cabin it to the involuntary‑rage/automatism corner and require a pretrial showing, by clear and convincing evidence, of all five of the following, plus specified disqualifiers.

Minimum convergence bundle (all required)

1) Event signature (moment-of-offense)
- Rapid, affective escalation after a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/bodycam/witnesses) of “blanking,” “seeing red,” autonomic arousal, confusion.
- Temporal proximity: seconds to a few minutes. Anything longer begins to look like choice, not reflex.

2) Pre‑offense pattern (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school discipline/IEPs, juvenile or ED notes for explosive episodes/dissociation, documented chronic sleep disruption). This addresses reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact” concerns.

3) Neurocognitive evidence (mechanism) with validity
- At least two independent inhibitory-control/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal Reaction Time, Go/No‑Go with commission errors, antisaccade; consider affective variants). WCST is ancillary; don’t rest the opinion on it.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) showing adequate effort; consistency across sessions or tests to blunt state noise.
- Low–moderate psychopathy trait profile (e.g., PCL‑R not in high range), consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression.

4) Psychiatric linkage (phenomenology)
- Structured‑interview diagnosis that maps to the index phenomenology (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to pre‑existing exposures; collateral corroboration. Biological stress indices (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) are supportive but not dispositive.

5) Independent developmental insult (causal plausibility)
- Objective, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one biologically plausible insult: childhood blood lead history ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or any ≥10); documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition during sensitive periods; well‑supported FASD risk. These don’t prove momentary dyscontrol, but in combination with #3 raise causal plausibility.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one defeats the excuse)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver.
- Evidence of planning/goal‑directed instrumental motive (luring, weapon staging, concealment, post‑event exploitation).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to the deprivation profile advanced (that is a different doctrine).
- Strong malingering indicators (failed PVTs; “too bad to be true” scatter) or marked inconsistency across sessions.

Gatekeeping/administrability
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing tied to a structured proffer across the five prongs; require defense notice and documentary exhibits (medical labs, CPS/school, housing/EPA, UI records; geocoded residence history).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to reduce partisanship; funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Limit the domain: reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts). Planned acquisitive crime is presumptively out. Many hard cases can be addressed instead via MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or sentencing mitigation.
- Bifurcation and instructions: keep Stage‑1 background out of the actus/mens rea phase; in the excuse phase instruct narrowly on “substantial impairment of inhibitory control such that the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform,” and forbid “poverty = excuse.”
- Special verdict interrogatories on each prong to preserve appellate review and public legitimacy.

Scientific cautions for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, acute legal stress degrade performance and flatten cortisol. Prefer repeated testing/standardized conditions and, crucially, pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can mimic chronic stress markers; hair cortisol gives a pre‑offense window; historic BLLs must predate the deficits.
- Task specificity: favor SSRT/antisaccade/affective inhibition over broad executive tests; treat WCST as peripheral.
- Biomarker overreach: neither cortisol nor fMRI “proves” loss of control at T‑0; they are at most supportive.
- Malingering/secondary gain: use multiple PVTs and collateral informants; be wary of selective, litigation‑patterned deficits.
- Intoxication confounding: separate developmental toxin history (lead, FASD) from acute alcohol/drug effects; the latter should defeat the excuse in almost all cases.

Bottom line
Used this way—as a narrow, rule‑governed automatism/dyscontrol avenue—the bundle can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a very small class of cases, consistent with Hart’s fairness limit. Cases that fall short should be channeled to MPC §210.3 EED (in homicide) or to structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators. This preserves administrability, cabins error costs, and maintains the expressive function of the criminal law while recognizing the rare defendant who truly had no fair opportunity to comply.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as givens, how would you design an administrable courtroom architecture for an RSB‑dyscontrol excuse? Please be concrete: (i) the pretrial framework (Daubert‑style proffer, neutral court experts, evidentiary standard); (ii) offense domain limits (reactive violence only? exclusions?); and (iii) whether this should be a complete excuse or an imperfect mitigation (e.g., reduces murder to manslaughter). Could you also sketch a short model jury instruction that (a) defines “substantial degradation of inhibitory control,” (b) identifies the converging findings jurors must see, and (c) lists disqualifiers (planning, voluntary intoxication, malingering). Finally, how do you analyze the error costs here—what’s the bigger institutional risk: false acquittals or false convictions under this doctrine, and how do you mitigate it?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m largely with Dr. Chen: none of these instruments can “time‑stamp” loss of control; they gain probative force only as a convergent bundle anchored to the event’s phenomenology and pre‑offense documentation. From a gatekeeping and administrability perspective, here is what I would deem both reliable enough and trial‑manageable.

1) What the tests/markers can and cannot do
- Best neurocognitive probes: stop‑signal (SSRT) and Go/No‑Go (with performance‑validity tests), plus an antisaccade task. Add an affect‑laden inhibitory task (affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop) because many assaults are trigger‑bound. WCST is weakly specific to inhibition; downweight it. Conventional Stroop is modestly helpful as part of a battery only.
- Biomarkers: historic childhood blood‑lead (BLLs) and documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency are probative of developmental hits to control systems; they are not momentary indicators. Hair cortisol gives a coarse, pre‑offense window on chronic stress but is nonspecific and subject to confounds; admissible as supportive, not core proof. I would exclude fMRI for decisional purposes in this setting—high face appeal, low incremental validity and serious Daubert risks.
- Psychiatric linkage: a structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype or Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented exposures, with symptom content mapping the index trigger, adds necessary clinical coherence.

2) Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
Require all of the following; no single item suffices:

A. Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous witnesses or recordings describing “blanking out,” “seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal. If planning/cover‑up is shown, the defense should presumptively fail.

B. Pre‑offense history
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental health notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits), and sleep disruption patterns. This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective inhibition) with intact effort indices (embedded PVTs and a stand‑alone measure), plus either replication across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Include a choice‑impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits (e.g., PCL‑R below the moderate range) consistent with impulsive rather than predatory aggression.

D. Clinical diagnosis mapping to the event
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis (PTSD/IED) by a qualified clinician, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index act. Biomarkers of chronic stress (hair/salivary cortisol profile) are supportive but not required.

E. Objective exposure/biological insult
- At least one documented developmental insult independent of litigation (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; documented FASD risk), plus longitudinal deprivation records (housing/school/violence exposure) to make the mechanism plausible. Show dose–response where feasible (e.g., higher BLLs track poorer inhibition).

F. Exclusions/controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse (RSB remains relevant at sentencing). Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time, malingering (multiple PVTs, informant corroboration), and clear instrumental motives. Adjust for state confounds (acute sleep loss, medication changes) by standardizing testing and, where possible, repeating.

3) Scientific and forensic pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep deprivation, incarceration stress, meds can depress performance and flatten cortisol; use standardized conditions, early testing, and pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity tests; beware “too bad to be true” patterns or isolated deficits on easily feigned tasks.
- Acute intoxication: alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; do not let toxin‑history evidence (lead, FASD) be a backdoor for intoxication excuses.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑offense stress can mimic chronic stress profiles; hair cortisol (pre‑offense segment) and historic pediatric/educational records mitigate this.
- Base‑rate and “brain‑porn” errors: do not over‑interpret group‑level associations or sexy imaging. Keep experts off the ultimate issue; focus them on capacity and mechanisms.
- Norming/inequity: ensure appropriate demographic norms for tests; appoint neutral experts and fund indigent defendants to avoid an affluent‑defendant advantage.

4) Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Limit the doctrine to genuinely reactive violence (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; special verdict interrogatories to capture each prong met.
- Curated exposure proof (geocoded ADI/violent‑crime residence, school finance, CPS, medical labs, EPA/HUD orders) by stipulation where possible to streamline trial.
- Tailored jury instruction on “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and its distinction from anger, intoxication, and mere impulse.

With those guardrails, a small subset of cases can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold. Most others should channel RSB to structured mitigation at sentencing (and ESB‑oriented conditions), which, in my view, preserves both fairness and public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as givens, are these Daubert-manageable in your view? Please specify the two or three administrability guardrails you think are essential (e.g., narrowing to reactive violence, clear‑and‑convincing burden, court‑appointed neutral experts), and offer a skeletal jury instruction for a “reactive dyscontrol” excuse that channels juror discretion without turning every hard case into an acquittal.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s architecture and Dr. Chen’s cautions. For courts, the touchstones are specificity to inhibitory control, temporal anchoring to the index event, and administrability. No single instrument or biomarker can time‑stamp loss of control; the only safe course is a convergent, pre‑specified bundle plus robust exclusion of alternatives.

What I would require (clear and convincing) before a dyscontrol instruction goes to the jury

Pretrial gatekeeping (Daubert/Frye):
- Notice and structured proffer tied to the elements below; defense bears C&C burden.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Production of raw test data, software logs, and validity indices; recorded test sessions where feasible.

Pillars of proof (all five, plus disqualifiers):
1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; disorganization; lack of planning or concealment; contemporaneous corroboration (witness/body‑cam/911) of “blanking out,” autonomic arousal. Any luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental conduct presumptively defeats the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile/ED notes of dissociation or IED; sleep disturbance tied to environmental stressors). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation.

3) Neurocognitive deficits in inhibition/affect regulation with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition‑relevant tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), corroborated across sessions or tasks; intact performance‑validity tests (stand‑alone and embedded). WCST is low‑specificity and should be down‑weighted. Include a delay‑discounting measure where available. Trait psychopathy measures used cautiously and only to support a reactive (not predatory) profile.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented exposures; symptom triggers plausibly explain the instant act. Physiological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening over the pre‑offense quarter) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation records of at least one biologically plausible insult (e.g., childhood blood lead history ≥5 µg/dL, ideally repeated or a ≥10 µg/dL spike; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), and evidence that exposure severity correlates with the observed executive deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; the doctrine should not launder self‑induced disinhibition.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania (use insanity route if appropriate), acute TBI at the time of offense, malingering (multiple PVTs), and strong instrumental motives.
- Timing: testing as early as practicable (ideally within 30–60 days) with attention to sleep/medication standardization; heavy weight on pre‑offense records to avoid forensic artifact.

On the proposed tools
- Stop‑signal and antisaccade are the most mechanism‑proximal; Stroop (especially affective variants) adds value; WCST is nonspecific.
- Hair cortisol is preferable to single‑day saliva for chronic load but is noisy (hair treatment, ethnicity) and only supportive.
- Historic BLLs are probative for developmental prefrontal insult but are not dispositive absent current inhibitory deficits.
- fMRI/EEG should be treated as research‑adjacent: admissible, if at all, only as supportive and never determinative; require pre‑specified analytic plans and independent review.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize and, where feasible, repeat testing; corroborate with pre‑offense documentation or actigraphy.
- Malingering/secondary gain: use multiple validity checks; beware selective, “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: separate developmental toxins (lead, FASD) from contemporaneous substances.
- Base‑rate/confirmation bias: ecologic deprivation does not equal individual dyscontrol; demand the individual‑level bridge.
- Criterion contamination/HARKing: require pre‑specified test batteries and analysis plans; scrutinize post hoc narratives.
- Misuse of trait instruments (e.g., PCL‑R) to over‑pathologize or to imply inevitability.

Domain limits and procedure
- Limit to genuinely reactive violence (and perhaps truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Use bifurcation and a specialized instruction focused on volitional capacity at the time of offense to protect the guilt phase from undue prejudice.
- If the gate is not met, RSB evidence belongs at sentencing under a validated mitigation framework (deprivation and toxin indicators).

Disposition
- If excused, employ ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision; reserve civil commitment (with ordinary mental‑illness criteria) for those still demonstrably dangerous. This addresses victim‑protection and legitimacy concerns without converting dyscontrol into a broad immunity.

Bottom line
The Santiago/Chen “five‑pillar” approach, tightened as above and coupled with neutral experts and bifurcation, is about as far as courts can go while keeping the doctrine narrow, evidence‑based, and administrable. It will make this a rare excuse, largely confined to the top tail of cumulative adversity where mechanism, history, and moment align.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge, building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage screen and Dr. Chen’s cautions, please get concrete. Draft (i) a model jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause” at the time of offense; and (ii) a pretrial gatekeeping protocol you would implement (Daubert hearing, required proffer items, neutral experts). Specify scope limits (reactive violence only), how voluntary intoxication interacts with the defense, and the role of court‑appointed experts. Finally, say a word on error‑cost calibration: how do you minimize false positives without rendering the doctrine illusory, and what resource guarantees for indigent defendants are necessary to keep this fair and administrable?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s perspective

Short answer: Standing alone, none of the proposed instruments is either specific or time‑resolved enough to prove loss of inhibitory control at the instant of the offense. Taken together, and only when they align with the event’s behavioral signature and pre‑offense documentation, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of reactive dyscontrol. Courts should treat the testing and biomarkers as corroborative, not dispositive.

Minimum bundle I would require (all of the following)

1) Event‑level reactive signature, contemporaneously corroborated
- Rapid escalation after a salient provocation; seconds to minutes, not hours.
- Disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment.
- Immediate witness/record evidence of “seeing red,” blanking, tremor/tachycardia, confusion (e.g., 911/body‑cam/video, neutral bystanders).
- Post‑event conduct inconsistent with instrumentality (e.g., no calculated flight, disposal, intimidation).

2) Pre‑offense history of dyscontrol, documented outside litigation
- School/juvenile/medical/CPS records predating the index offense showing stimulus‑bound rage, dissociation, explosive outbursts, sleep disruption; not merely poor impulse “traits,” but episodic loss of control in comparable contexts.

3) Neurocognitive evidence of impaired inhibition with validity safeguards
- At least two independent tasks directly tapping inhibition/affect regulation (e.g., stop‑signal or Go/No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go/affective Stroop), each ≥1.5 SD below appropriate norms, with intact performance‑validity indices (embedded and stand‑alone) and, ideally, stability across a repeat session.
- Downweight WCST; it is nonspecific. Include a delay‑discounting or similar impulsive choice measure as supportive.
- Personality profile consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R; used cautiously).

4) Clinical linkage that maps mechanism to the moment
- Structured diagnostic assessment (by a qualified clinician) establishing a relevant disorder (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom triggers plausibly align with the index provocation; anchored in pre‑offense records.
- Physiological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) can support the story but is not required; single‑day salivary cortisol is too noisy to carry weight.

5) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with developmental mechanism
- At least one non‑forensic, historical biological insult (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated, or a documented ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; prenatal alcohol exposure) that plausibly contributes to current executive deficits, with dose‑response logic (higher exposure, poorer inhibition).

And all of the following exclusions/controls

- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects at the time of offense defeat the excuse absent compelling evidence that baseline dyscontrol, independent of intoxication, was the substantial cause. The default should be that voluntary intoxication negates this excuse.
- Alternative primary causes ruled out: psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures, acute TBI at the scene, strong instrumental motives.
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple performance‑validity tests; cross‑task consistency; symptom validity checks; collateral informant reports.
- Timing safeguards: testing as early as practicable (ideally within 30–60 days) and triangulated with pre‑offense documentation to avoid “forensic artifact.”

On specificity and temporal sensitivity

- The behavioral signature and contemporaneous corroboration do the temporal work; laboratory tasks and biomarkers cannot time‑stamp a lapse of control to the second.
- Lead history, iron deficiency, and chronic stress indices increase mechanistic plausibility; they are not specific to criminal dyscontrol. Treat them as one leg of a tripod with (i) event phenomenology and (ii) neurocognitive/clinical findings.
- fMRI and similar advanced imaging should generally be excluded or, at most, received as weakly supportive after Daubert scrutiny; risk of “brain overclaim syndrome” is high.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medications, withdrawal, pain, and the stress of incarceration can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer hair cortisol over single‑day saliva; replicate when feasible; lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/coaching: use a battery of embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; be wary of selective, “too bad to be true” deficits confined to legally salient tasks.
- Acute intoxication: disentangle chronic toxin history (lead, FASD) from voluntary substance use at the offense; the latter should presumptively defeat the excuse.
- Reverse causation and forensic artifact: post‑charge stress can produce the very profiles offered as proof. Pre‑charge documentation is the antidote.
- Base‑rate and ecological validity problems: many offenders show executive weaknesses; avoid the prosecutor’s and defense fallacies. Ask whether this defendant’s combined profile, aligned with this event, makes substantial impairment highly likely.
- Cultural/measurement bias: ensure appropriate norms for neurotests; be cautious with instruments (e.g., PCL‑R) that carry bias concerns.

Gatekeeping and administrability

- Require a pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing keyed to a structured checklist mirroring the bundle above; written proffer with dated, non‑forensic records; chain‑of‑custody for environmental/medical data.
- Appoint neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); fund parity for indigent defendants so the doctrine is not illusory.
- Limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and only the rare, truly impulsive nonviolent act); exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Jury instruction (sketch)

- Make plain that heightened anger or ordinary impulse is not enough; the question is whether, because of proven developmental insults and trauma, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an otherwise avoidable act was substantially degraded at the time.
- Emphasize that voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse; and that the laboratory and biomarker evidence are supportive only insofar as they align with pre‑offense history and the event’s reactive signature.

Bottom line

Used this way—event signature at the core, pre‑offense documentation, neurocognitive deficits with validity checks, a plausible clinical diagnosis, and at least one objective exposure biomarker, with clear exclusions—the Stage 2 criteria can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow class of cases. That alignment, plus rigorous gatekeeping, is what keeps the doctrine morally credible and institutionally governable.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, from an administrability and error‑cost perspective, do Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution bundle satisfy what you’d want to see at Daubert and to keep juries from being overwhelmed? If not, what specific trims or additions would you impose—e.g., narrow to reactive violent offenses only, require pre‑offense records as a hard precondition, set time windows for testing, mandate neutral experts? Could you sketch the core of a model jury instruction that defines “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause,” and say whether you’d try guilt/RSB in a bifurcated phase with a special verdict? Finally, where would you place the burden (clear and convincing vs. preponderance), and how would you ensure resource parity so the doctrine doesn’t become class‑skewed?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s architecture: Stage 2 must do the “moment-to-mechanism” work, and no single test can time‑stamp loss of control. The bundle has to converge on a reactive, unplanned episode in a person with pre‑existing inhibitory deficits traceable to documented adversity/toxin exposure, with credible exclusion of alternative drivers. That is the only way a court can fairly reach clear and convincing on substantial volitional impairment at the time of offense.

On the proposed tools

- Neurocognitive batteries
  - Strong probative value: stop‑signal (SSRT), Go/No‑Go (including affective variants), antisaccade, flanker interference; add a delay‑discounting measure. Require multiple performance‑validity tests and, ideally, re‑testing or cross‑task convergence.
  - Supportive/limited: classic Stroop (interference resolution more than motor inhibition); WCST (set‑shifting)—I would down‑weight WCST.
  - Temper trait measures (e.g., PCL‑R) and use only to help distinguish reactive from predatory styles; they are not dispositive.

- Stress/exposure markers
  - Historic blood lead levels (BLLs) in childhood—probative of developmental injury to prefrontal systems if elevated in sensitive windows and documented pre‑offense.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition records—supportive, not specific.
  - Cortisol: single‑day salivary profiles are too noisy; hair cortisol (last 3 months) is better for chronic load but still non‑specific and confounded. These should be corroborative only.
  - Consider HRV (vagal tone) or threat‑potentiated startle as supportive physiology of poor affect regulation, not as stand‑alone proof.

Minimum bundle to meet clear and convincing

I would require all of the following six pillars, with no disqualifier present:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Seconds‑to‑minutes escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; lack of weapon staging/luring/cover‑up. Prefer contemporaneous corroboration (video, 911, body‑cam, neutral witnesses describing “went blank,” marked autonomic arousal).

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED/clinic visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption) to anchor temporality and reduce reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), intact performance‑validity indices, and either replication on a second sitting or cross‑task convergence. Include one impulsive‑choice metric if feasible.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the episode and anchored to exposures documented in Stage 1. Biology (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) is corroborative only.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or one ≥10; documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency; credible FASD risk) that pre‑dates and plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

6) Exclusion of alternative proximate causes
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the primary driver; no primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; no clear instrumental motive; no malingering (multiple PVTs, cross‑source consistency).

Disqualifiers (any one defeats the excuse)
- Evidence of planning or instrumental concealment; toxicology consistent with intoxication‑driven dyscontrol; “forensic artifact” testing (gross deficits emerging only after charge without pre‑offense echoes); failure of validity testing.

Scientific pitfalls for courts

- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress depress executive performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions, consider actigraphy/collateral sleep data, and privilege pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use embedded and stand‑alone validity indices; be wary of selective, “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles or improvement when incentives change.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition. As a rule, voluntary intoxication should vitiate this excuse unless baseline dyscontrol is independently established and the substances were de minimis.
- Reverse causation and timing: Post‑offense stress can flatten cortisol and affect testing. Hair cortisol helps for pre‑offense windows; the best antidote is contemporaneous documentation created before litigation.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: Neither cortisol nor neuroimaging is specific or time‑precise; admit only as supportive. Historic BLLs are helpful only if tied to the developmental window and current deficits.
- Task specificity and cultural bias: Prefer tasks with clearer links to inhibition; ensure appropriate norms and language accommodations to avoid spurious deficits.
- Expert drift and cherry‑picking: Require full disclosure of raw data and all test results; consider court‑appointed neutral experts and Daubert‑style pretrial hearings.

Administrability guardrails

- Limit the excuse to reactive violent offenses (and truly impulsive nonviolent acts in rare cases); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Use a bifurcated procedure with specialized instructions to keep juror focus and public legitimacy.
- Ensure resource parity for indigent defendants (neutral experts, records retrieval), or the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

Bottom line

The Stage‑2 toolkit is directionally sound if tightened: weight event‑level proof and pre‑offense documentation most heavily; treat neurocognitive and biological findings as corroborative mechanism evidence, not time‑stamps. Only when all pillars align, and disqualifiers are absent, should a court find substantial volitional impairment by clear and convincing evidence. Cases that fall short should be routed to structured sentencing mitigation.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume a defendant proffers what Prof. Santiago called the five‑pillar bundle and Dr. Chen’s safeguards (reactive event signature; pre‑offense dyscontrol records; valid inhibition deficits; trauma/IED diagnosis with plausible mapping; a documented developmental toxin/nutrition marker; plus exclusion of intoxication and malingering). From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, how would you structure the gatekeeping and the jury phase? Please be concrete: (i) what should a pretrial Daubert‑style hearing decide (and on what record) versus what goes to the jury; (ii) would you require bifurcation and a standardized limiting instruction, and how would you phrase the instruction to avoid pseudo‑medical overreach; and (iii) are there one or two pieces of this bundle you would drop or substitute to simplify without sacrificing reliability? Press on equality concerns: how do we ensure indigent defendants can meet these thresholds without turning every violent case into a resource‑intensive mini‑trial?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen has it right on first principles: no single test can time‑stamp loss of control; the law should demand converging lines that tie mechanism, history, and the moment. From an evidentiary/administrability standpoint, I would adopt a narrow Stage‑2 bundle, require a clear‑and‑convincing showing at a Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing, and cabin use to reactive violence.

1) What the tools can and cannot do
- Neurocognitive batteries: Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go (with valid SSRT) and antisaccade are the most probative of inhibitory control; Stroop/affective variants add context; WCST is weakly specific and should be down‑weighted. Multiple performance‑validity tests are essential. Results are trait‑leaning and state‑sensitive; they support but do not decide momentary dyscontrol.
- Stress/exposure markers: Historic BLLs during sensitive periods and well‑documented early malnutrition are probative of developmental insult; hair cortisol (3‑month window) can corroborate chronic allostatic load but is nonspecific. None is a moment‑of‑offense gauge; all are supportive only.
- fMRI: high Rule 403 risk and limited forensic reliability; if admitted at all, only for background and never as a linchpin.

2) Minimal bundle I would require (all five; no single element suffices)
A. Event signature (most weight)
- Rapid, affective escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of planning/cover‑up; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam, witness accounts of “went blank,” autonomic arousal). If there was luring, weapon staging, or instrumental concealment, the defense should presumptively fail.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity; prior ED or clinic notes of dissociation/IED; documented chronic sleep disruption). This guards against reverse‑causation/forensic artifact.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), stable across sessions or with cross‑test convergence, plus intact performance‑validity indices. Low–moderate psychopathic traits to fit an impulsive (not predatory) pattern.

D. Psychiatric mapping to the event
- Structured diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to pre‑existing exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the index trigger/response; established with validated instruments (e.g., CAPS‑5, PCL‑5). Physiologic corroboration (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one biological insult consistent with impaired prefrontal control (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), strengthening mechanistic plausibility.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; mixed cases require proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; consistency across time; collateral informants.
- Alternative causes: rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless separately addressed), acute TBI at the event, and clear instrumental motives.
- Timing: early testing (within 60–90 days) and reliance on pre‑offense records to mitigate state effects of incarceration/legal stress.

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds (sleep loss, meds, acute stress) depressing task performance and cortisol; standardize testing conditions; consider repeat testing/actigraphy.
- Base‑rate neglect: many disadvantaged defendants will meet Stage‑1 exposure; Stage‑2 must do the heavy lifting to avoid over‑attribution.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge stress altering biomarkers; lean on pre‑charge documentation and hair cortisol.
- PCL‑R misuse: limited reliability across examiners; treat as context, not a gate.
- Over‑weighting glossy neuroscience: high prejudice/low incremental probativity (Rule 403) for jurors.

4) Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert hearing keyed to a standardized checklist; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.
- Limit offense domain to reactive violence (and, rarely, truly impulsive nonviolent bursts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions: the jury is not to condemn or excuse poverty per se; the question is fair opportunity to conform at the moment.

Bottom line: Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar approach is the right template. With those elements, tested under Rule 702/Daubert and hemmed in by offense type and disqualifiers, a court can defensibly find substantial volitional impairment in a small subset of cases without opening the floodgates or inviting junk science.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence as givens, how would you make this administrable on the bench? Please propose precise jury‑instruction language for a dyscontrol excuse (defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and proximate causation), note any offense‑eligibility limits you’d impose (e.g., reactive violence only), and identify the key error risks (false positives/negatives) with concrete safeguards you’d require at Daubert and trial to keep the doctrine tight.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I read Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 as directionally right but, from the bench’s perspective, it only works if we convert it into a disciplined admissibility-and-proof framework. None of the listed instruments can time‑stamp loss of control; they are probative only in convergence with pre‑offense records and an event profile that looks like reactive, not instrumental, violence. My bottom line:

1) Sufficiency of the proposed tools
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go; antisaccade; affective interference) are the best we have for inhibitory control. They are not specific, and they are state‑sensitive, but with performance‑validity checks and consistency across sessions, they can carry weight.
- WCST has low specificity to inhibition; I would down‑weight or omit it.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic BLLs are supportive of mechanism and temporality; they cannot, standing alone, prove momentary dyscontrol. fMRI should be treated as demonstrative only, not dispositive.

2) What I would require to meet clear and convincing (both admissibility and merits)
Require all of A–D, plus E unless impossible for reasons stated on the record:

A. Event signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; minimal planning; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions of dissociation (“saw red,” “blanked out”), autonomic arousal; any luring, weapon staging, or concealment presumptively defeats the excuse.

B. Pre‑offense corroboration
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school IEP/discipline for explosive outbursts; juvenile mental‑health notes; ED visits); this answers temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal, antisaccade errors, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests passed and either replication across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive rather than predatory aggression (use PCL‑R cautiously; low‑to‑moderate range supports, high psychopathic traits undercut).

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index act
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored in pre‑offense exposures; symptom triggers plausibly explain the incident. Biological stress corroboration is helpful but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult
- Independent record of at least one biological insult consistent with prefrontal control vulnerability (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or one ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk). Where such records are genuinely unavailable despite due diligence, require stronger showings under B–D.

Exclusions/controls (all must be satisfied):
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate cause (ordinary doctrine should apply).
- No primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; if present, this is a different doctrine.
- Negative malingering indicators (multiple PVTs; symptom validity; collateral consistency).
- Timing safeguards: testing as early as practicable and reliance on pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact.”
- Offense domain: limit to reactive violent offenses (and the rare truly impulsive nonviolent act); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.

3) Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Rule 104(a)/Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a standardized proffer checklist reflecting the elements above; appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology/psychiatry/environmental health.
- Notice and discovery: geocoded residence histories, school/CPS/medical/EPA/HUD/UI records; toxicology; body‑worn camera/911 audio where available.
- Burden: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Jury instruction: a tightly drafted instruction focusing the ultimate question on substantial loss of inhibitory control at the time, not mere heightened susceptibility; expressly direct jurors to discount voluntary intoxication and to consider planning/cover‑up as contra‑indicators.

4) Scientific/legal pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication, acute legal stress will depress performance and flatten cortisol; require standardized testing conditions or replication.
- Malingering/secondary gain: insist on multiple validity measures and look for “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense incarceration stress can mimic chronic profiles; lean on pre‑offense documentation and hair cortisol when feasible.
- Instrument overreach: fMRI/EEG can mislead; limit to illustrative context with strict Daubert scrutiny.
- Norms/equity: ensure tests use appropriate demographic norms; beware cross‑cultural or language artifacts.

Disposition note
If the excuse is found, I would not default to hospital commitment absent mental illness. Use a court‑supervised ESB disposition (trauma‑focused care, housing/sleep/nutrition interventions, removal from criminogenic settings, employment pipelines), with risk‑management conditions; reserve civil commitment for those who meet the statutory mental‑illness/danger criteria.

With these constraints—event‑level fit, pre‑offense corroboration, valid neurocognitive deficits, a clinical bridge, and an objective developmental insult, alongside strong exclusions—the doctrine will apply rarely and predictably, honoring Hart’s fairness limit without opening the floodgates.

### Speaker: Host

Taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as givens, can you specify the court’s gatekeeping protocol and a model jury instruction to keep this administrable and narrow? In particular: (i) what should a pretrial Daubert/Rule 104(a) hearing require (neutral experts, notice, documentary thresholds, exclusion of voluntary intoxication, etc.); and (ii) draft concise instruction language defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and the “reactive event signature,” while warning jurors not to treat deprivation alone as exculpatory. Please be concrete so trial courts have usable text and steps.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

Bottom line. The Stage‑2 package Prof. Santiago sketches can, if tightly cabined, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment in a narrow class of reactive violence cases. None of the proposed measures is temporally precise enough alone. Courts should demand convergence across event‑level phenomenology, pre‑offense documentation, and objective testing, and should police common forensic pitfalls under Rule 702/Daubert and Rule 403.

On the specific tools

- Neurocognitive batteries
  - Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with valid SSRT) are the most probative of inhibitory control; still state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation) and must be paired with performance‑validity tests and, ideally, a re‑test.
  - Stroop (especially an affective variant) adds value; classic WCST (set‑shifting) has low specificity to “dyscontrol” and should carry little weight.
  - Add an oculomotor antisaccade or flanker task and a delay‑discounting measure to triangulate impulsivity; ensure culturally appropriate norms and document effort validity (TOMM/embedded PVTs).

- Stress/exposure markers
  - Historic childhood blood‑lead levels (BLLs) are probative of developmental insult if elevations occurred during sensitive windows and the current executive profile tracks a dose‑response. They do not speak to the moment of offense.
  - Diurnal salivary cortisol is noisy; hair cortisol (3‑cm segment) is the better chronic‑load index but remains nonspecific and confounded by hair treatment/ethnicity. Treat as supportive, not determinative.
  - HRV/threat‑startle can support an affect‑regulation mechanism; again, supportive only.
  - fMRI/EEG should generally be excluded or strictly limited; incremental probative value is low relative to prejudice and interpretive disagreement.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; short latency (seconds/minutes), disorganized execution; absence of planning or cover‑up. Corroborate with body‑cam/911/witness accounts showing “seeing red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal. Any luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental conduct is a strong counter‑indicator.

2) Pre‑offense, non‑forensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School IEP/discipline, juvenile or ED notes, prior treatment records evidencing stimulus‑bound rage/dissociation or impulse‑control failures, dated well before the offense. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive convergence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), plus a convergent impulsive‑choice metric, with intact effort indices and, ideally, stability across sessions. Low/moderate psychopathic traits to support a reactive rather than predatory profile.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps onto the event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom triggers that plausibly explain the index event. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation records of at least one biological exposure (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a spike ≥10; documented FASD risk; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition) plus a plausible dose–response link to current deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls

- Voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse (absent a recognized involuntary intoxication doctrine). If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; look for consistency across sessions and collateral reports; be wary of “too bad to be true” patterns or selective impairment.
- Alternative causes: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time of offense, and clear instrumental motives.
- Timing: complete testing as early as practicable and rely heavily on pre‑charge records; recognize that incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress cognitive performance (reverse‑causation risk).

Gatekeeping and administrability

- Pretrial Daubert hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health. Exclude speculative or purely correlation‑talk masquerading as causation.
- Standardize the admissibility checklist (event signature; pre‑offense documentation; test convergence with validity; diagnosis mapping; objective exposure; disqualifiers addressed). If the proffer fails any prong, exclude.
- Limit the doctrine to short‑latency reactive violence (and perhaps a narrow band of truly impulsive non‑violent offenses); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Place the clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense and give a tailored instruction that the evidence, if credited, goes only to excuse (loss of fair opportunity to comply), not to justification or general character.
- Ensure indigent defendants have resources to meet the showing; otherwise the doctrine will skew toward the resourced and undermine legitimacy.

Common pitfalls for courts to watch

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, caffeine, pain, or legal stress can depress performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions and, where feasible, re‑test or corroborate.
- Cultural/test‑norm bias and examiner allegiance effects: insist on appropriate norms and independent review.
- Base‑rate/reference‑class error: many deprived persons will meet Stage‑1; Stage‑2 must do the narrowing work. Do not infer “cause” from group correlation without the required individual‑level alignment.
- Over‑weighting shiny biomarkers (especially fMRI) and under‑weighting contemporaneous event evidence.

In sum: the proposed batteries and markers are, at best, trait‑level indicators that, when aligned with a compelling event signature and pre‑offense history, can support the Hart fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply. Use them as part of a convergent bundle, keep the offense domain narrow, and build procedural guardrails (neutral experts, standardized checklists, limiting instructions). That preserves administrability and public confidence while allowing relief in the rare case where mechanism and moment truly line up.

---

### Speaker: Host

To finish your assessment, could you unpack the reverse‑causation problem—i.e., how post‑offense stress, detention, or litigation can themselves alter cortisol profiles and depress executive‑function scores—and specify concrete guardrails to minimize it? What testing timelines, reliance on pre‑offense records, and replication/verification protocols would you require before a court treats Stage‑2 findings as reflecting preexisting dyscontrol rather than forensic artifacts?

---

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

…Over-interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI, EEG, and similar signals are group-level research tools with poor individual-level specificity and test–retest reliability. They should not be treated as dispositive “brain scans of guilt/no guilt.” If admitted at all, they should be tightly cabined to mechanism support and accompanied by clear limiting instructions.

Additional pitfalls and how to handle them
- Base-rate and circularity problems
  - Even moderately abnormal tests have low positive predictive value in high‑risk forensic samples; courts should avoid treating any single abnormality as proof of dyscontrol.
  - “Exposure equals impairment” is a circular fallacy; adversity increases risk but does not compel impairment. Require actual impairment evidence (pre‑offense records and valid testing).

- Norms and measurement error
  - Use demographically corrected norms on neuropsych tasks (age, sex, education, race/ethnicity where appropriate) and multiple tasks per construct to mitigate measurement noise.
  - Repeat or cross‑validate key findings when feasible to reduce state noise and examiner effects.

- Adversarial allegiance and coaching
  - Prefer court‑appointed neutral experts; require transparency in testing protocols, raw data access, and performance‑validity results.
  - Be alert to selective impairment patterns that track secondary gain rather than neurocognitive architecture.

- Psychiatric diagnosis inflation
  - Insist on structured instruments (e.g., CAPS‑5 for PTSD; SCID‑5 for other disorders) administered by qualified clinicians, with symptom mapping to the index event and corroboration beyond self‑report.

- Physiological confounds
  - Cortisol/HRV are affected by sleep, substances, cardio‑metabolic disease, and medications. Standardize sampling, document confounds, and interpret as supportive only.

- Acute intoxication and mixed causes
  - Voluntary intoxication commonly degrades inhibition; absent exceptional circumstances, it should defeat the excuse. If substances were present, require credible evidence of baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.

- TBI and psychosis
  - Traumatic brain injury can mimic dyscontrol. If claimed, seek corroboration (medical records, imaging when available) and ensure temporality precedes the offense. Primary psychosis/mania belongs under different doctrines unless directly tied to documented RSB exposures.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)
Make Pillars 1 and 2 mandatory, plus at least two of Pillars 3–5, and no disqualifiers.

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol (mandatory)
- Rapid, affect‑laden escalation after salient provocation; disorganized execution; no evidence of instrumental planning/cover‑up; contemporaneous observations of dissociation/physiological arousal.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (mandatory)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school/juvenile/medical records).

3) Valid neurocognitive evidence of impaired inhibition/affect regulation
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two relevant tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indices and cross‑task convergence.

4) Clinically established linkage
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD with dissociation, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) that plausibly maps to the index event; biological stress markers may support but are not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of at least one exposure (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure), predating and plausibly contributing to current deficits.

Plus all of:
- Toxicology excluding substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver.
- Multiple performance‑validity checks negative for malingering.
- Exclusion of clear alternative primary causes (acute psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, strong instrumental motive).

Operational recommendations to courts
- Hold a pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts; require standardized proffers tying each piece of evidence to the specified pillars.
- Emphasize in jury instructions that:
  - No single test proves dyscontrol; the question is whether converging evidence shows substantial degradation of inhibitory control that substantially contributed to the act.
  - Population risk is not enough; case‑specific impairment and event‑level fit are required.
- Limit applicability to reactive violence (and truly impulsive nonviolent acts in rare cases); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.

Bottom line
The Stage 2 framework is directionally sound if courts demand alignment across mechanism (documented exposures and impairments), history (pre‑offense records), and moment (event signature), while rigorously screening out state effects, intoxication, and malingering. Used this way, the science can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment in a small subset of cases without inviting floodgates.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume we adopt Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle and a clear‑and‑convincing standard for a dyscontrol excuse. What concrete gatekeeping and instruction architecture would you implement to keep the doctrine tight and comprehensible? Please specify: (i) the pretrial Daubert protocol (what gets admitted vs. excluded—e.g., fMRI, hair cortisol, WCST); (ii) whether to require court‑appointed neutral experts and standardized test batteries/validity checks; and (iii) a model jury instruction/verdict form that focuses jurors on reactive, non‑instrumental conduct and addresses voluntary intoxication. Aim to minimize error costs and battle‑of‑experts dynamics while preserving defendants’ ability to prove genuine loss of control.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Two points at the outset. First, none of these tools time‑stamps loss of control. If we are to let a dyscontrol excuse go to a jury, the heavy lift must be done by the event itself—what happened, how quickly, with what indicia of dissociation—and by pre‑offense documentation showing the same kind of reactivity long before there was a forensic incentive. Second, to keep this administrable, courts should demand convergence across a small set of pre‑specified indicia and treat the lab science as corroboration, not as the engine.

Are the proposed measures specific/temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive tasks. Stop‑Signal (SSRT), Go/No‑Go, and antisaccade are the best of the lot for inhibitory control; Stroop adds modestly; WCST is too nonspecific to carry much weight. All are state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation) and vulnerable to coaching, so they establish trait‑level vulnerability, not momentary incapacity. Require performance‑validity tests and, where feasible, re‑testing or cross‑task convergence.
- Stress/toxin markers. Historic childhood blood lead levels (BLLs), documented malnutrition/iron deficiency, or credible FASD risk are probative of developmental insult to prefrontal systems if they predate the offense. Diurnal or hair cortisol captures chronic load, not the instant. I would admit these as plausibility enhancers only.
- Bottom line. None is specific or timely enough alone. Used together, aligned with event‑level phenomenology, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a narrow class of reactive cases.

Minimum bundle I would require (all five; clear and convincing; defense burden)
1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Acute provocation to action window measured in seconds or a very few minutes; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous evidence of dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”), autonomic arousal, or post‑event confusion. Prefer contemporaneous video/911/body‑cam or multiple independent witnesses.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic history of similar dyscontrol
- School, pediatric, CPS, or mental‑health records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound outbursts, dissociation, Intermittent Explosive Disorder–like episodes, chronic sleep disruption. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and antisaccade, or SSRT and affective Go/No‑Go/affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indices and either stability on repeat or cross‑task convergence. Include a delay‑discounting or similar impulsive choice measure if available. Downweight WCST.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index offense
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response pattern in the instant event. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, or a single ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition markers during sensitive periods; credible FASD risk) that predates and plausibly contributes to current inhibitory deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/disqualifiers
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (e.g., BAC ≥0.08 with no baseline dyscontrol): defeats the excuse.
- Evidence of planning or instrumental motive: luring, weapon staging, threats to “come back,” concealment, or calm post‑event flight/cleanup.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at offense; malingering (multiple failed performance‑validity tests).
- High psychopathic trait profile suggesting predatory rather than reactive aggression (used cautiously).

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss, medication changes, or custodial stress depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; look for pre‑offense records; prefer replication/cross‑task convergence.
- Malingering/secondary gain. Use embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; be wary of “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” or highly selective deficits.
- Acute intoxication. Distinguish developmental “toxins” (lead, FASD) from contemporaneous substances; the latter generally defeats an excuse.
- Reverse causation. Post‑charge stress can alter biomarkers; hair cortisol can give a pre‑offense window but has confounds (hair treatments, ethnicity). Do not over‑read single‑day salivary profiles.
- Over‑interpretation/“neuro‑exuberance.” fMRI/EEG should not be determinative. Treat them, if admitted, as low‑weight support.
- Test bias and base rates. Ensure demographically appropriate norms; avoid base‑rate neglect (most people from deprived settings will not qualify).

Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tethered to a structured proffer; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Standardized documentary templates (school/CPS/medical labs/housing/EPA‑HUD/UI records) and geocoded exposure histories.
- Limit the offense domain to genuinely reactive violence (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcate and give specialized instructions keyed to Hart’s fairness limit: the question is whether, at the moment, defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform due to an involuntary dyscontrol state.

Disposition (if excuse is found)
- Conditional, noncarceral ESB‑oriented supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, sleep/nutrition supports, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, job pipelines), with civil commitment available only upon the usual mental‑illness/dangerousness showing.

This keeps faith with the moral core—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity—without inviting a flood. In my judgment, requiring (1) a tight, corroborated reactive event; (2) pre‑charge dyscontrol history; (3) valid inhibition deficits; (4) a diagnosis that maps to the event; and (5) at least one documented developmental insult, together with the disqualifiers above, will make this an uncommon but principled pathway—akin to involuntary‑rage automatism in tightly defined circumstances.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, from an administrability and error-cost perspective, are Prof. Santiago’s and Dr. Chen’s Stage 2 bundles workable in court? Specifically: (1) What Daubert screening would you require for SSRT/antisaccade and affective inhibition tasks, hair cortisol, and historic blood‑lead levels (admissible as supportive vs. determinative)? (2) Would you adopt a clear‑and‑convincing burden and court‑appointed neutral experts? (3) Should the excuse be categorically limited to reactive violence? And (4) how would you draft a jury instruction on “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” that distinguishes ordinary impulsivity from exculpatory dyscontrol while minimizing moral‑luck and disparate‑application risks? Please be concrete about instruction language and the Type I/Type II error tradeoffs you’re willing to accept.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally right: none of these instruments can time‑stamp volitional failure, but a tightly specified bundle can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference that inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the moment of a reactive offense. The law’s task is to demand alignment across mechanism, history, and the event, and to keep the gate narrow enough to preserve legitimacy.

On the proposed tools
- Neurocognitive tasks. Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with valid SSRT estimation) and antisaccade are the most probative of motor inhibition; an affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop helps tie deficits to negative affect triggers. WCST is least specific; downweight it. All testing must include multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and, ideally, a retest for stability.
- Stress/exposure markers. Historic blood lead levels (in early childhood) and documented early malnutrition are probative of developmental insult, not momentary state; they strengthen plausibility when paired with executive deficits. Cortisol metrics (prefer hair cortisol over single‑day salivary curves) are at best supportive of chronic stress; they are not specific. I would not admit fMRI (or similar) as anything more than background education—its individual-level probative value is low and the prejudice risk high.

Minimum converging bundle to meet clear and convincing
Make two items mandatory and require at least three additional pillars, with no single pillar sufficient:

Mandatory
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol:
- Seconds–minutes between salient provocation and act; no luring/preparation; disorganized execution; contemporaneous observations (video/911/body‑cam/witness) of “seeing red,” dissociation, autonomic arousal. Any evidence of planning, weapon staging or post‑event instrumental behavior presumptively defeats the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (non‑forensic, predating the charge):
- School/juvenile/clinical records showing stimulus‑bound explosions, dissociation, or IED‑like episodes; sleep disruption tied to environmental stressors; notations of rage episodes. This addresses temporality and reduces “forensic artifact” risks.

Plus at least three of the following four
3) Neurocognitive profile with validity:
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indices and cross‑task convergence; include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available. Trait profile consistent with impulsive—not predatory—aggression (e.g., low‑to‑moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event:
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and response, anchored to documented exposures.

5) Objective developmental insult:
- Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or any ≥10), or documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition/FASD risk in sensitive windows, independent of litigation.

6) Supportive physiological stress evidence (optional but weight‑bearing if present):
- Hair cortisol indicating chronic dysregulation; low resting high‑frequency HRV. Treat as corroboration, not core proof.

Disqualifiers and exclusions (all must be addressed)
- Voluntary intoxication proximate to the act defeats the excuse absent persuasive proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of the substance (as a rule, do not allow the defense where intoxication is a substantial concurrent cause).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures, acute TBI at offense, or strong instrumental motive defeats the excuse; such cases belong under other doctrines, if any.
- Malingering: require multiple PVTs, consistency across sessions, and collateral informants; “too bad to be true” selective deficits warrant rejection.

Scientific and forensic pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medications, pain, and legal stress can depress executive performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions, prefer early testing (30–60 days), and lean on pre‑offense records. Retest where feasible.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and degrade testing. Hair cortisol (pre‑offense segment) and historic pediatric/educational records mitigate this.
- Adversarial allegiance/over‑interpretation: fMRI/EEG are not decision tools; keep them out or strictly cabined. Avoid cherry‑picking scattered deficits to build a narrative.
- Base‑rate neglect: many deprived defendants will show some impairments; the doctrine must require the event‑level signature and pre‑offense documentation to distinguish the exceptional case from the modal.

Administrability guardrails I would require
- Offense limitation: confine the excuse to affective/reactive violent offenses with immediate provocation. For homicide, channel most cases to MPC‑style EED mitigation; reserve a full excuse for automatism‑like meltdowns.
- Burden and hearing: defense bears clear‑and‑convincing proof at a pretrial Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing; use court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych/psychiatry/environmental health). Require standardized proffers (geocoded exposure history; medical, school, CPS, housing, EPA/HUD, UI records).
- Notice and funding parity: firm notice deadlines; ensure indigent defendants have resources to meet the showing, or the doctrine will skew by wealth.
- Jury instruction: bifurcate and use a tailored charge: the question is whether, because of proven RSB‑related dyscontrol, the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform at the moment of the act. If not satisfied, consider EED (in homicide) or address RSB at sentencing.

Disposition
Where the excuse is found, I would not default to prison alternatives without structure. Order ESB‑oriented conditions (trauma‑focused therapy, stable housing away from criminogenic locales, nutrition/sleep remediation, job supports) under tight court supervision; hold a separate dangerousness hearing if needed for civil commitment under existing standards.

Bottom line
Used this way—as a convergence test with mandatory event‑level proof and pre‑offense documentation—the batteries and markers can help juries answer Hart’s fairness question without inviting floodgates. Most cases will not clear this bar; those that do are the rare ones where full condemnation would be unjust and counterproductive.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your administrability hat: assuming Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle and disqualifiers, is this workable in a trial court? What concrete gatekeeping would you require (e.g., Daubert checklist, neutral experts, notice/templates) and what limiting principles (offense domain, intoxication bar, burden/standard) to keep juries from being swamped? If you think it’s viable only as mitigation, please sketch a pattern instruction that channels this evidence to sentencing without confusing guilt.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen has it right on the science: none of these instruments time-stamps loss of control. The law can still work with a convergent, pre‑specified bundle, but only if we keep the gate tight, insist on pre‑offense documentation, and anchor everything to the event signature. I would adopt a structured “Stage 2” showing along these lines, with a clear-and-convincing burden on the defense and a narrow offense domain (reactive violence).

Minimum bundle I would require (all must be met)

1) Event-level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near-immediate escalation after a salient provocation; seconds to minutes, not hours.
- No luring, staging, or concealment; disorganized execution.
- Corroboration, where available, from video/911/bodycam or neutral witnesses describing dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”), autonomic arousal (tremor, pallor, hyperventilation).
- If there is meaningful planning or post‑event instrumental behavior, the defense presumptively fails.

2) Pre‑offense history of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile or medical notes documenting dissociation/Intermittent Explosive Disorder‑like episodes, ED visits for rage events, chronic sleep disruption tied to environmental stressors. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation risk.

3) Neurocognitive profile specific to inhibition/affect regulation, with validity
- At least two measures ≥1.5 SD below age/education norms on tasks tapping inhibitory control and affective interference (e.g., Stop‑Signal Reaction Time or Go/No‑Go; antisaccade; an affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop).
- Include delay discounting or similar impulsive choice measure.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) showing adequate effort; ideally corroborated across two sittings to dampen state noise.
- Downweight WCST; it is not specific to the mechanism in issue. Do not treat any single test as determinative.
- Trait profile consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression; if PCL‑R is used, treat cautiously and as one data point only.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician of a trauma‑ or impulse‑control disorder (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to exposures documented in Stage 1 and whose symptom triggers plausibly explain the index offense.
- Physiologic corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol over the 3 months including the offense window) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one biological exposure likely to impair prefrontal control (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated, or any ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; credible FASD risk with records). These are not time‑locked but bolster causal plausibility when paired with current deficits.

Necessary disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls

- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; generally, alcohol/drug‑driven impairment is non‑exculpatory.
- Exclude primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time of offense, malingering.
- Testing soon after the offense (ideally within 30–60 days), with standardized conditions (sleep, meds) and repeat or collateral corroboration to mitigate state effects.
- Heavily weight nonforensic, pre‑charge records to avoid “forensic artifact” profiles.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication changes. Use actigraphy or collateral sleep history; repeat testing where feasible.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity indices; be wary of selective, “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” impairment on easy‑to‑fake tasks.
- Acute intoxication: do not conflate historic toxin exposure (lead) with voluntary substance use at the event.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance; prefer hair cortisol for pre‑offense window and pre‑offense records.
- Neuro‑temptation: fMRI/EEG have rhetorical punch but low forensic utility here; admit, if at all, only as supportive.

Gatekeeping and procedure

- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a written checklist reflecting the bundle above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Offense limitation: reactive violent offenses (and only the truly impulsive tail of nonviolent acts). Planned acquisitive crime is out.
- Burden and causation: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act (more than trivial; not necessarily but‑for).

Jury management and instructions (model language)

- “You may consider expert and documentary evidence only insofar as it bears on whether, at the time of the offense, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate, affect‑driven response was substantially impaired. General associations between hardship and crime are not sufficient.”
- “If you find by clear and convincing evidence that due to severe environmental deprivation and its documented effects the defendant’s inhibitory control was substantially impaired, and that such impairment was a substantial factor causing a rapid, provoked act, you must find the defendant excused on a dyscontrol theory.”
- “Voluntary intoxication at the time of the offense defeats this excuse.”

Why this is administrable

- It centers the most probative anchors—event signature and pre‑offense records—while treating labs and tests as corroborants, not magic keys.
- It narrowcasts to cases where mechanism, history, and moment line up; in practice, only a small fraction of violent cases will clear all five pillars without tripping a disqualifier.

Finally, to preserve legitimacy: when the bundle falls short, RSB belongs at sentencing under a validated mitigation framework (documented deprivation, toxins, trauma) with ESB‑oriented conditions. That channels most cases to mitigation and reserves excuse for the rare, mechanistically and temporally compelling instance of involuntary‑rage dyscontrol.

### Speaker: Host

Putting on your evidence‑gatekeeper hat: would you adopt a structured, Daubert‑style admissibility protocol for RSB–dyscontrol evidence, and if so, what exactly goes on the checklist by evidence class? Please specify concrete reliability/fit requirements (and exclusions) for (i) neurocognitive tasks, (ii) stress/toxin biomarkers like hair cortisol and childhood BLLs, and (iii) longitudinal exposure records, and note any categorical disqualifiers (e.g., fMRI, single‑day cortisol) you would impose to keep juries from over‑crediting weak science.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Bottom line up front: I find Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 framework directionally sound but would tighten it in three ways to preserve administrability and legitimacy: (1) narrow the offense domain to truly reactive interpersonal violence; (2) demand pre‑offense documentation and multi‑method convergence on inhibitory control deficits, with strict exclusionary criteria; and (3) formalize a gatekeeping checklist and neutral‑expert review. The science can support “highly likely” impairment, not second‑by‑second time stamps, so the legal test must be a structured, clear‑and‑convincing convergence standard.

What I would require at Stage 2 (clear and convincing)

Mandatory convergence across five pillars; failure on any one is disqualifying:
1) Event signature (reactive, not instrumental)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; no luring, staging, weapon acquisition for the encounter, or concealment behavior.
- Disorganized execution; contemporaneous witness/video/911/body‑cam evidence of dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”), autonomic arousal.
- Cooling‑off longer than minutes, or pursuit, presumptively defeats the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense history (non‑forensic, predating the charge)
- School/juvenile/medical or employment records evidencing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control, sleep disruption, or prior ED visits for explosive reactivity.
- If the only evidence of dyscontrol is generated post‑charge, the showing fails.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- At least two inhibitory/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD impaired (e.g., Stop‑Signal/SSRT or Go/No‑Go; antisaccade; an affective variant such as emotional Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting), all with multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests and acceptable effort.
- Downweight WCST; it is too nonspecific. Stroop only as part of a broader battery.
- Trait profile inconsistent with predation (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured diagnostic workup (PTSD—including dissociative subtype—or Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to Stage‑1 exposures and triggers plausibly explaining the instant offense. Collateral informants where possible.
- Physiological support (e.g., hair‑cortisol flattening; low resting HF‑HRV) is helpful but not required.

5) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented developmental insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or one ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), with timing that can plausibly contribute to current executive deficits.

Per se disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse (even if history includes toxins/trauma). Mixed cases must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Strong evidence of planning/instrumental motive (weapon staging, luring, concealment, retaliation after delay) defeats the excuse.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures belongs in insanity, not here.
- Malingering: require multiple PVTs, test–retest or cross‑task consistency, and collateral behavior consistency; “too bad to be true” profiles or selective failures should sink the claim.

On the proposed tools and their limits
- Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go and antisaccade are the most pertinent; include an affective inhibition task because many incidents are affect‑triggered.
- Cortisol: prefer hair cortisol (3‑month window) over single‑day salivary diurnals; still supportive, not dispositive.
- Historic BLLs matter only if measured during sensitive windows and paired with current inhibitory deficits; they are not time‑of‑offense measures.
- fMRI/EEG: admissible, if at all, only as low‑weight corroboration after Daubert review; courts must avoid “neuro‑flash” overreach.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, pain, meds, and legal stress depress task performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; where feasible, repeat or triangulate; lean on pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can mimic chronic stress signatures; hair cortisol and historic records mitigate this.
- Coaching/secondary gain: enforce rigorous validity batteries; neutral examiners; look for cross‑situational consistency.
- Substance effects: separate chronic adversity from acute intoxication; the latter is non‑exculpatory in this doctrine.

Institutional guardrails (to keep the gate tight)
- Daubert‑style pretrial hearing using a standardized checklist keyed to the five pillars and disqualifiers; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Ensure funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Offense carve‑out: limit to reactive violent offenses (and, only in exceptional cases, truly impulsive low‑level offenses). Exclude robbery/burglary/felony‑murder and other planned acquisitive crimes.
- Timing: testing within 60–90 days when practicable; heavy weight on pre‑charge documentation.

Jury instruction (to preserve focus and legitimacy)
- Bifurcated trial with a tailored instruction: “You may find the defendant not guilty by reason of dyscontrol only if you find by clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the act, his/her capacity to inhibit an immediate, affect‑driven response was substantially degraded, and that this degradation—stemming from cumulative, documented environmental insults—was a substantial contributing cause of the act. Mere exposure to hardship, anger, or voluntary intoxication is insufficient.”
- Emphasize “substantial” impairment and “substantial contributing cause,” not but‑for, to reflect multiple causation.

Disposition
- If excuse is found: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused therapy; housing relocation; nutrition/sleep; job pipelines) with risk assessment; civil commitment only where statutory criteria for dangerousness are met. Ensure victims’ participation and protective conditions.

Anticipated frequency
- With these thresholds and disqualifiers, I would expect successful claims to be rare (a small fraction of reactive violence cases). That rarity is a feature, not a bug: it respects Hart’s fairness limit without inviting a flood or eroding protection for communities most at risk.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as givens, please make this administrable: draft a 75–100 word pattern jury instruction for an RSB–dyscontrol excuse that (a) defines “substantial degradation of inhibitory control,” (b) states the causation standard (“substantial contributing cause”), and (c) sets the burden (clear and convincing) while preserving the voluntary‑act requirement. Then name three bright‑line disqualifiers you would enshrine (e.g., voluntary intoxication, evidence of planning) to keep the doctrine narrow. Would you require a special verdict form? Briefly justify.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Short answer: As stand‑alone items, neither the cognitive tasks nor the stress biomarkers are specific or time‑precise enough to prove loss of inhibitory control “at the moment.” As a convergent bundle tied to a reactive event signature and pre‑offense documentation, they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow slice of cases. The court’s job is to police methodology (Daubert), temporality, and alternative‑cause exclusions, and to cabin the doctrine to reactive violence.

1) Admissibility and weight: what I would allow and how
- Neurocognitive tests
  - Primary: Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (with SSRT), antisaccade, and an affective inhibition task (emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop). These target inhibition/affect regulation more directly than WCST; I would downweight or exclude WCST.
  - Requirements: multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone), standardized administration, and either repeat testing or cross‑test convergence.
  - Limits: no single deficit proves momentary dyscontrol; results are state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, pain, legal stress).

- Biomarkers
  - Childhood blood lead (BLL) records and other developmental insults (IDA/malnutrition, documented FASD risk): probative on mechanism, not time‑stamping.
  - Stress physiology: hair cortisol (3‑month window) is more useful than single‑day salivary profiles; still supportive only.
  - I would not admit fMRI/EEG for individual attribution absent strong reliability/validity showings; if admitted, strictly as background mechanism, not determinative.

- Psychiatric linkage
  - Structured diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established by qualified clinicians using validated instruments, anchored to documented exposures and mapped to the index event’s phenomenology (triggers, dissociation).

- Event‑level proof
  - Core of the case. Video/body‑cam/911 audio or credible witness accounts of rapid escalation post‑provocation, disorganized behavior, “saw red/went blank,” marked autonomic arousal; absence of luring, staging, or concealment.

- Daubert guardrails
  - General acceptance and known error rates for each tool; disclosed testing conditions; chain‑of‑custody for historical records; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health). Rule 403 limits to avoid “seductive allure” of neuroscience.

2) Minimum bundle to reach clear‑and‑convincing
All of the following; no single pillar suffices:
- A. Reactive event signature: near‑immediate, affect‑laden confrontation; no planning/concealment; contemporaneous corroboration of dissociation/physiologic arousal.
- B. Pre‑offense history of dyscontrol: nonforensic, pre‑charge records (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile/ED notes of dissociation or rage episodes, sleep disruption) establishing temporality.
- C. Neurocognitive profile with validity: ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and antisaccade or affective Go–No‑Go), intact performance‑validity indices, and either test–retest stability or cross‑test convergence; low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits (used cautiously).
- D. Psychiatric diagnosis mapping to the event: structured PTSD/IED (or comparable) tied to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the index act; stress physiology (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) supportive but not required.
- E. Objective developmental insult: documented childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or ≥10 once) or comparable biological insult (IDA/malnutrition, FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to current deficits.

And all disqualifiers/controls satisfied:
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (routine tox screens; voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse in my view).
- No strong evidence of instrumental/planned motive (luring, weapon staging, cover‑up).
- Malingering safeguards passed (multiple PVTs; consistency across sources).
- Alternative primary causes ruled out (acute psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense).

3) Scientific and forensic pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Prefer pre‑charge records; standardize testing; consider actigraphy where feasible.
- Reverse causation and forensic artifact: post‑offense testing alone is weak; require pre‑offense documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: robust validity testing; be wary of selective or “too bad to be true” profiles.
- PCL‑R misuse: limit to excluding predatory profiles; avoid over‑reliance, especially given racial bias concerns.
- Biomarker essentialism: lead/malnutrition explain risk, not moment; cortisol is noisy; neuroscience visuals risk undue prejudice (Rule 403).
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: neighborhood deprivation proves exposure, not individual dyscontrol; tie to individual records and deficits.

4) Offense domain and instructions
- Limit to genuinely reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Pattern instruction (guilt phase or special issue): The defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence that at the time of the offense the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an impulsive response was substantially impaired, and that the impairment was a substantial contributing cause of the act; background adversity alone is insufficient.
- Explicit intoxication instruction: voluntary intoxication cannot supply the required impairment.

5) Disposition and public legitimacy
- If excused: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision (trauma‑focused care, nutrition/sleep interventions, housing relocation, employment supports), with structured violence‑risk assessment and, where legally applicable, civil commitment if the person remains dangerous. Victim input and safety planning are essential.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 framework, tightened as above, and Dr. Chen’s cautions can be made administrable. The “minimum bundle” requires alignment across (i) a reactive event, (ii) pre‑offense dyscontrol history, (iii) valid inhibition deficits, (iv) a diagnosis mapping mechanism to moment, and (v) an objective developmental insult—with intoxication/planning excluded. That will keep the gate narrow, focus juries on fair‑opportunity to comply (Hart), and preserve public legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, how would you structure the pretrial gatekeeping and the trial phase to handle Prof. Santiago’s/Dr. Chen’s multi‑factor dyscontrol showing without turning every violent case into a Daubert war? Be concrete: burdens, timing, neutral experts, special verdict questions, and the precise jury instruction you’d give to channel “reactive dyscontrol” (and to exclude voluntary intoxication) while preserving public legitimacy and equal access for indigent defendants.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you. From a trial-judge vantage, I would translate Prof. Santiago’s and Dr. Chen’s science into a narrow, rule-governed gate. Two preliminaries about scope:

- At guilt, I would cabin exculpation to a tightly defined “involuntary‑rage/automatism” or “reactive dissociative state” category. Broader dyscontrol belongs in MPC-style extreme emotional disturbance (EED) in homicide and in structured sentencing mitigation. That keeps error costs and expressive harms in check.

- Any dyscontrol excuse must be limited to reactive violence (seconds–minutes after a salient trigger). Planned or instrumental crimes are out.

Within that frame, the Stage 2 attribution must show, by clear and convincing evidence, that inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of the offense and that the degradation substantially contributed to the act. No single test will do; you need convergence and temporality. Here is the minimum bundle I would require, plus disqualifiers and safeguards.

A. Minimum convergence for clear-and-convincing proof of reactive dyscontrol
1) Event signature (proximal and reactive)
- Acute provocation with near-immediate escalation; disorganized execution; no staging, luring, or concealment.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video/bodycam/911, or neutral witnesses) of “blanking out,” “seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal, or dissociation.

2) Pre-offense documentation (temporality)
- Non-forensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline, pediatric/CPS, ED visits, juvenile mental health) showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control, sleep disruption, or trauma-related dissociation.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two validated inhibition/affect-regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go/antisaccade, plus an affective variant), with intact performance‑validity indices and either retest stability or cross‑task convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured-diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to pre‑offense exposures, with symptom content/timing plausibly explaining the index event.
- Physiological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- At least one independent, pre‑offense biological exposure (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or one ≥10; documented lead hazard order; FASD risk; sustained iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; chronic sleep disruption with collateral records). This is not a timestamp but strengthens causal plausibility when paired with (3) and (4).

B. Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Clear instrumental motive, weapon staging, or calculated post‑offense conduct defeats the excuse.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures belongs in insanity or is outside this doctrine.
- Robust malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs, cross-source consistency, and caution about “too-bad-to-be-true” profiles.

C. Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, pain, legal stress depress test performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer corroboration and retest or pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation: post‑arrest stress can flatten cortisol; hair cortisol can cover a pre‑offense window; pre‑charge documentation is best.
- Task specificity: WCST and classic Stroop are nonspecific; downweight them. Favor inhibition tasks (stop‑signal, antisaccade) and affective versions when available.
- Biomarker overreach: fMRI/EEG are not determinative; admit, if at all, as supportive only.
- Norms and equity: ensure culturally appropriate norms; avoid over‑pathologizing poverty.

D. Procedural safeguards and limits (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); standardized proffer templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA, geocoded history).
- Offense limitation: reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts); presumptive exclusion of planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcation and instructions: guilt first; if automatism fails, instruct on EED (homicide) and proceed to a sentencing phase where RSB mitigation can be fully aired.

E. Model instruction (sketch)
“The defendant asserts that, because of a reactive dissociative state induced by cumulative, verified environmental deprivation, the act was involuntary. To succeed, the defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence that: (1) an acute provocation immediately preceded the act; (2) at that moment the defendant experienced a dissociative or automatic state that substantially impaired his capacity to inhibit the act; and (3) this impairment substantially contributed to the act. Poverty or hardship alone is not a defense. Evidence of planning, voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause, or calculated conduct negates this defense.”

Disposition
- If excused, impose a supervised ESB plan (housing relocation from criminogenic settings, trauma‑focused treatment, nutrition/sleep interventions, job supports) with violence‑risk monitoring; civil commitment remains available where statutory criteria are met.
- If not excused, EED may mitigate homicide; otherwise, use structured sentencing mitigation tied to verified indicators (e.g., longitudinal deprivation, toxin exposure), with victim voice and public‑safety conditions.

Bottom line
I largely agree with Dr. Chen: none of these measures time‑stamps “loss of control,” but a narrow, convergent bundle—event signature, pre‑offense records, valid inhibition deficits, a diagnosis that maps to the moment, and at least one objective developmental insult—can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a small fraction of cases. With tight disqualifiers, neutral experts, and offense limits, we preserve legitimacy, protect victims, and avoid floodgates, while honoring Hart’s fairness limit on blame.

---

### Speaker: Host

From an evidentiary and jury‑management standpoint, would you admit the Santiago/Chen bundle (SSRT/Go‑No‑Go, affective Stroop/antisaccade with validity checks; hair or salivary cortisol; historic childhood BLLs; event‑level dissociation testimony) under Daubert, and if so, on what precise admissibility criteria and per‑se exclusions to avoid mini‑trials and junk science? Please sketch a tight gatekeeping order: which instruments are in, which are out (e.g., WCST, standalone fMRI), the burden (“clear and convincing” for the excuse, but preponderance for admissibility?), and the limiting instruction you’d give to ensure the jury does not treat trait‑level findings as time‑stamped proof of loss of control at the moment of offense.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you, Chair. Two framing points before specifics. First, the law should treat any dyscontrol excuse as an automatism variant: a narrow, transient loss of self‑command at the moment of action. Anything short of that belongs in MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or in sentencing mitigation. Second, because none of the proposed scientific tools can time‑stamp loss of control, the centerpiece must be event‑level behavior, with neurocognitive and exposure evidence used only as corroboration.

On the proposed measures
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (ideally with affective variants) are the most probative of inhibitory control. Stroop is supportive; WCST is too nonspecific for guilt‑stage decisions and should be downweighted. Include antisaccade or flanker. Always pair with multiple performance‑validity tests and, where feasible, a re‑test for stability.
- Stress/toxin markers: Historic BLLs from childhood, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, and documented prenatal alcohol exposure increase plausibility of enduring executive deficits; they do not establish momentary dyscontrol. Hair cortisol can reflect chronic stress over prior months, but it is nonspecific and sensitive to confounds. I would not admit fMRI for case‑level attribution; at most, it is a pedagogical adjunct.
- Psychiatric diagnosis: PTSD (especially dissociative subtype) or IED can “connect the dots,” but the diagnosis must predate the offense or be corroborated by nonforensic records; ex post labels carry little weight without anchors.

Minimum convergence for clear‑and‑convincing proof of automatism‑grade dyscontrol
Require all of the following; no single element suffices:
1) Event signature
- Acute, salient provocation; seconds‑to‑minutes latency; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions of “blanking out,” dissociation, or autonomic arousal. Body‑cam/911/witness/video are best. Any significant planning or post‑event instrumentality should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound explosive reactivity or dissociation (school IEP/discipline, juvenile clinic notes, ED visits, prior incident reports). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indices and either replication or cross‑test convergence. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting). Trait psychopathy should be low to moderate, consistent with reactive (not predatory) aggression.

4) Mechanistic linkage
- A qualified clinician establishes PTSD/IED (or closely related) with symptom content that plausibly maps triggers and phenomenology of the index event, corroborated by longitudinal records. Biological stress markers may support but not replace this showing.

5) Objective developmental insult (at least one)
- Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or any ≥10); or documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive periods; or credible FASD risk—each independently documented prior to litigation. The point is mechanism plausibility, not moment‑of‑offense proof.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication: Substantial alcohol/drug intoxication operating as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. Where substances are present at low levels, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering/state confounds: Multiple stand‑alone and embedded PVTs; standardize testing for sleep/meds; be wary of “too bad to be true” patterns. Repeat or triangulate where feasible.
- Alternative causes: Rule out primary psychosis/mania (absent a separate insanity theory), acute TBI at the scene, and clear instrumental motives.
- Timing: Conduct testing as soon as practicable (30–60 days) and anchor conclusions in pre‑offense records to avoid forensic artifact.

Scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confusion (acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication changes) can depress performance and cortisol; insist on standardized conditions and collateral corroboration.
- Over‑reliance on nonspecific markers (cortisol, WCST) to do causal work they cannot do.
- Misuse of PCL‑R and fMRI in individual adjudication.
- Base‑rate neglect: many deprived defendants will show executive weaknesses; only a small fraction will meet an automatism standard at the moment of offense.

Procedural safeguards and administrability
- Notice and a pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Limit to reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Burden on the defense: clear and convincing evidence that (i) volitional control was substantially degraded at the time and (ii) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; without it, the doctrine will be both under‑ and mis‑applied.
- Bifurcation and a tailored instruction to avoid morphing excuse into justification; jurors should be told the question is fair opportunity to comply, not whether the act was understandable.

Channeling borderline cases
- If the bundle fails on event immediacy or automatism but shows substantial affective impairment, confine it to EED (homicide) with an MPC §210.3 “person in the actor’s situation” instruction.
- Otherwise, reserve the exposure and deficit evidence for structured sentencing mitigation, using verified indicators (e.g., chronic unemployment, lead exposure, childhood malnutrition) to calibrate punishment and impose ESB‑oriented conditions.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 architecture is directionally sound; Dr. Chen’s cautions about specificity and timing are well‑taken. The law can responsibly recognize a dyscontrol excuse only when event‑level behavior, pre‑offense history, valid neurocognitive deficits, a plausible mechanistic diagnosis, and an objective developmental insult all line up, with intoxication and instrumentality ruled out. Anything looser risks false acquittals and public cynicism; anything tighter collapses the fairness limit Hart and Fletcher require.

---

### Speaker: Host

Assuming we adopt Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar framework and disqualifiers, make this administrable: What precise pretrial gatekeeping (Daubert factors, neutral court‑appointed experts, notice/templates) and a model guilt‑phase jury instruction would you implement to minimize Type I (excusing the culpable) and Type II (punishing the substantially blameless) errors? Please specify: (i) the burden and standard (overall vs element‑by‑element clear‑and‑convincing; unanimity expectations); (ii) the elements the jury must find (including disqualifiers like substantial voluntary intoxication or planning); (iii) how to weigh conflicting party experts versus neutral experts; and (iv) whether to confine the defense to reactive violent offenses and use bifurcation. Also, what funding parity mechanisms would you require to avoid an affluent‑defendant advantage without swamping dockets?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery:

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen’s caution and Prof. Santiago’s ambition, but I would trim this to what a trial court can actually administer without inviting error or inequity. Two guideposts: Hart’s “fair opportunity to conform” and tight, rule‑governed gates. If we recognize a dyscontrol excuse, it should be confined to reactive violence with a short fuse and proven through pre‑offense documentation plus limited, well‑validated testing. No single instrument proves moment‑of‑offense loss of control; the law should require convergence and exclude alternative drivers.

What I would require to meet clear and convincing evidence

All five of the following, with no one pillar sufficient:

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Acute provocation followed by action within seconds to a few minutes; disorganized execution; lack of staging, luring, or concealment.
- Corroboration via witnesses, 911/body‑cam/video, contemporaneous statements (“blanked out,” “saw red”), and autonomic signs (tremor, pallor)—not just after‑the‑fact narrative.

2) Pre‑offense history of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records showing episodic explosive reactivity or dissociation: school IEP/discipline, juvenile/ED notes, probation notes, sleep disruption tied to neighborhood violence. This answers temporality and guards against reverse causation.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), administered by neutral expert(s) within ~60 days, with multiple performance‑validity checks and, ideally, replication or cross‑task convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (e.g., PCL‑R not in the high range), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps onto the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented adversities, with trigger content plausibly explaining the offense. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol) may support but should not be required nor carry much weight standing alone.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or ≥10 once; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑substantiated prenatal alcohol exposure) that plausibly contributes to present executive deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers and controls

- Substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate cause defeats the excuse. Trace or incidental use must be shown not to drive the behavior.
- Planning or instrumental features (weapon transport for an ambush, luring, post‑event concealment or profit motive) rebut reactive dyscontrol.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; cross‑source consistency; beware “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, or strong instrumental motive—if present—defeats this doctrine and belongs in other boxes (insanity, intoxication, or standard mens rea).
- Timing: heavy reliance on pre‑offense records; post‑charge testing subject to state–trait confounds (sleep loss, acute stress) and should be corroborative, not the spine of the case.

On the tools

- Accept a small, standardized inhibition battery (SSRT/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, one affective interference task) plus effort measures; downweight WCST and avoid over‑interpreting Stroop alone.
- Treat fMRI/advanced imaging as inadmissible or, at most, marginally supportive under a Daubert screen; these are not case‑level adjudicative tools.
- Hair cortisol or diurnal salivary profiles are noisy; admit as supportive only with proper controls and disclosure of limitations.
- Historic BLLs and geocoded hazard records are far more probative than post hoc opinions; courts should privilege “old‑fashioned” records (medical, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD).

Procedural guardrails

- Offense domain: presumptively limited to reactive violent offenses; exclude planned acquisitive crimes and retaliatory gang shootings with preparation. MPC‑style EED remains the proper mitigation path in homicide when full excuse fails.
- Pretrial Rule 104/Daubert hearing with a structured checklist tied to the five pillars; require defense notice; appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; ensure funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Burden: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time and (ii) the degradation was a substantial contributing cause.
- Jury management: bifurcate where feasible; use special interrogatories (reactive vs. instrumental; presence of substantial intoxication; substantial degradation of control; substantial causal link to documented RSB exposures) and a tailored instruction that emphasizes this is an excuse (not a justification).

Disposition

- If excused, prefer ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused treatment, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep stabilizers, vocational supports) with judicial supervision; reserve civil commitment for the truly dangerous who also meet mental‑illness criteria. This respects victims’ safety without collapsing into carcerality.
- If the excuse fails, RSB should still travel at sentencing through a validated mitigation framework keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators, not amorphous “societal fault” apportionment at guilt.

Why this is governable

- Requiring (1) a tight event signature; (2) pre‑offense documentation; (3) convergent, validity‑checked inhibition deficits; (4) a diagnosis mapping trigger to act; and (5) an objective developmental insult—while screening out intoxication and instrumental motives—will confine the doctrine to a small top‐tail of adversity and a narrower subset of cases where mechanism and moment align. In practice, very few cases will clear a Daubert hearing; fewer still a jury on C&C.

Final note

Prof. Santiago’s structure is directionally right; Dr. Chen accurately marked the scientific limits. Courts should resist boutique science and keep the doctrine moored to Hart’s fairness limit and to evidence we can audit. Beyond that narrow lane, the right place for RSB is MPC‑style EED in homicide and structured sentencing mitigation.

### Speaker: Host

Given Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle, please draft the core jury instruction you’d give if the court recognizes a narrow dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse at guilt. Keep it tight: define “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” in fair‑opportunity terms, specify the defense’s burden (would you use clear‑and‑convincing?), and clearly distinguish it from insanity and MPC extreme emotional disturbance. Include explicit disqualifiers (e.g., voluntary intoxication as proximate cause, evidence of planning/instrumental motive) and make clear that mere exposure to deprivation is insufficient. Aim for language a lay jury can apply without collapsing into sympathy or nullification.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I am largely aligned with Dr. Chen: no single test can time‑stamp a loss of control; the law will live or die on convergence and fit to the moment. If courts are to admit a dyscontrol excuse at guilt, I would cabin it to a narrow, automatism‑adjacent lane and require a structured, pretrial proffer that hits specific pillars with clear‑and‑convincing force.

1) What the tools can and cannot do
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go; antisaccade; affective Stroop) are the right family; WCST adds little to inhibition. They are trait‑leaning and state‑sensitive; use them only within a multi‑test battery with multiple performance‑validity checks and, ideally, a brief retest for stability.
- Stress markers (hair cortisol; pre‑existing BLLs; pediatric iron deficiency) are mechanistic context, not clocks. Historic BLLs in early childhood are probative of frontostriatal risk; cortisol profiles are noisy but supportive of chronic allostatic load. I would not credit fMRI for case‑level attribution; too much inferential stretch.

2) Minimum bundle to reach clear and convincing
Require all of the following, with each element documented independently of litigation wherever possible:

A. Event signature (moment)
- Rapid affective escalation from a salient provocation; minimal planning; disorganized execution; contemporaneous observations of dissociation/“saw red”/marked autonomic arousal; no luring, staging, or post‑event instrumental concealment. Prefer objective corroborants (video, 911/body‑cam audio).

B. Pre‑offense history (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (e.g., school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile mental‑health notes; ED visits; documented chronic sleep disruption). This guards against reverse causation.

C. Neurocognitive profile (mechanism)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal; antisaccade error rate; affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact, multi‑method effort indices and either cross‑test convergence or short‑interval retest stability. Include a choice‑impulsivity measure (delay discounting) as auxiliary.

D. Clinical linkage (phenomenology)
- A structured, DSM‑5 diagnosis plausibly mapping to the index event (e.g., PTSD with dissociative features; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), established by a qualified clinician, tied to pre‑offense exposures; biological corroboration (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not mandatory.

E. Developmental biological insult (dose–response plausibility)
- At least one documented developmental insult likely to degrade inhibitory circuitry: repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (or a prior ≥10); or pediatric iron‑deficiency/malnutrition with labs; or well‑documented FASD risk. Show a plausible dose–response by linking the exposure history to present inhibitory deficits.

And all of the following exclusions:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver (should defeat the excuse).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to the RSB pathway (that is a different doctrine).
- Strong evidence of predatory motive/planning.
- Malingering flags (failed PVTs, “too bad to be true” patterns, intra‑battery inconsistency).

I would avoid reliance on PCL‑R cut‑scores as a gate (risk of bias and overread); if used at all, only to help distinguish reactive from predatory patterns, with caution.

3) Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Notice and Daubert‑style hearing: defense must file a standardized checklist with exhibits (medical/CPS/school/housing/EPA/UI, geocoded residence history) and propose test batteries in advance.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to reduce partisanship and resource skew.
- Timing: testing within 60–90 days of the event where feasible, plus reliance on pre‑offense records to mitigate state–trait confounds.
- Offense class limitation: presumptively available only for reactive violent offenses (homicide, aggravated assault) with immediate provocation; exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Burden: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.
- Jury instruction (bifurcated if needed): “Substantial impairment” means the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform conduct at the time; voluntary intoxication does not qualify. Use a special verdict on impairment to guide disposition.

4) Pitfalls to watch
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, custody stress depress performance and cortisol; require standardized conditions and, where possible, retest or collateral sleep documentation (actigraphy helpful).
- Reverse causation: favor pre‑charge records; hair cortisol offers a pre‑offense window but is confounded by hair practices.
- Coaching/malingering: insist on multiple PVTs, embedded and stand‑alone; look for selective impairment patterns.
- “Culture shopping”: keep the lens on volitional control, not broad sociological narratives, at the guilt phase; reserve most “societal fault” for sentencing.

5) Disposition
Where the excuse is found, dispositions should be ESB‑oriented and supervised (trauma‑focused treatment, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep remediation, employment pipelines), with civil commitment only where ongoing dangerousness and a qualifying mental illness are shown. This respects victims’ protection interests and public legitimacy while reserving full condemnation for those with a fair chance to comply.

This bundle—event‑level fit, pre‑offense documentation, validated inhibitory deficits, a clinical mechanism, and a developmental insult, coupled with strict exclusions—keeps the doctrine within a small, governable set of reactive cases and aligns with Hart’s fairness limit without inviting floodgates.

---

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and legitimacy standpoint, how would you translate Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution into courtroom architecture? Please propose a concrete gatekeeping and instruction framework: (i) the contents of a pretrial Daubert‑style proffer/checklist; (ii) the burden of proof and whether to bifurcate guilt from the dyscontrol excuse; (iii) the narrow offense domain (e.g., reactive violence only); and (iv) model jury‑instruction language to define “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause,” so jurors don’t lapse into free‑floating sympathy or strict causation. Be specific about neutral experts and funding parity to avoid science theater and disparate access.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Big picture. I agree with Dr. Chen: no single test or biomarker can time‑stamp volitional failure. The only administrable path is a tightly cabined, convergent bundle tied to Hart’s “fair opportunity” limit and applied in a narrow offense domain (reactive violence). Courts must police both scientific validity (Daubert/Kumho) and fit (Rule 403) to avoid turning structural disadvantage into a guilt‑phase absolution.

Are the proposed tools specific/temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑signal (SSRT), Go/No‑Go, and antisaccade are the closest we have to inhibitory control; useful only as part of a battery with performance‑validity testing and, ideally, re‑test consistency. Stroop and WCST are less specific to inhibition; I would downweight WCST and use affective variants (emotional Go‑No‑Go/Stroop) given the affect‑laden triggers in these cases.
- Stress/ exposure markers: Historic childhood BLLs (documented before the offense) are probative of developmental insult; hair cortisol can index chronic stress over the prior months but is nonspecific and state‑sensitive. Neither can prove moment‑of‑offense loss of control; they serve plausibility, not timing.
- Neuroimaging: Highly prejudicial; absent exceptional circumstances, exclude for lack of temporal specificity and risk of “brain‑porn” bias.

Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard
Require all of the following, proved with independent records where possible, and with the defense bearing a clear‑and‑convincing burden:

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate, affective response to a salient provocation; no meaningful planning or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous observations of dissociation (“went blank/ saw red”), autonomic arousal; video/911/body‑cam corroboration if available.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, prior ED/clinic notes of dissociation/IED‑like episodes, juvenile records), to address temporality and reduce reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity safeguards
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with intact stand‑alone and embedded performance‑validity measures; either re‑tested stability or cross‑test convergence. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) as supportive. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits (e.g., PCL‑R below moderate range) to fit an impulsive/reactive, not predatory, profile.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented adversities and with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index behavior. Physiological corroboration (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope; low resting HF‑HRV) may support but should not be required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult pre‑dating the offense (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or any ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), with a dose‑response story that lines up with the measured executive deficits.

And all of these disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication at or near the proximate cause defeats the excuse (mitigation is a sentencing question).
- Evidence of planning, luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental behavior defeats the excuse.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the event; or malingering (multiple PVT failures) defeats the excuse.
- Testing protocols: conducted as early as practicable (ideally within 30–60 days), standardized for sleep/meds/caffeine where possible, and accompanied by collateral pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: Sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication changes can depress executive performance and cortisol. Prefer pre‑offense documentation; consider repeat/confirmatory testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple validity indices; beware selective “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” patterns.
- Acute intoxication: Do not let historic toxin exposure be a back‑door intoxication defense; separate chronic developmental insults from acute voluntary substance effects.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑charge stress can mimic chronic stress signatures; hair cortisol helps with a pre‑offense window, but collateral records are key.
- Base‑rate problem: Many defendants will meet adversity criteria; very few will satisfy the full convergence demanded here. Avoid diluting the gate by treating any single marker as dispositive.
- Over‑weighting glamorous science: fMRI/EEG images are rarely probative on the legal question and risk unfair prejudice (Rule 403).

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert/Kumho hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above; defense notice and reciprocal discovery; deadlines to obtain school/medical/CPS/EPA records.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to reduce partisanship and “culture shopping.”
- Limitation to offense class: presumptively available for reactive violent offenses; excluded for planned acquisitive crimes.
- Model instruction: The jury must find that, at the time of the act, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit a strong, affect‑laden impulse was substantially degraded, and that this degradation was a substantial factor in causing the act; structural disadvantage alone is not a defense. Voluntary intoxication does not satisfy this standard.

Bottom line. With these thresholds and safeguards, Stage‑2 attribution can be made administrable and rare. It keeps faith with Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply—while preserving public legitimacy and victim protection by reserving full excuse for the narrow subset where mechanism, history, and moment truly converge.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming a jurisdiction recognizes a narrow dyscontrol excuse, how would you design the procedural guardrails so it’s administrable and reviewable? Please propose (a) a pretrial gatekeeping standard with specific Daubert-style factors for admitting a dyscontrol claim, and (b) model, tightly worded jury instructions (including the burden of proof, a definition of “substantial volitional impairment,” and how to treat voluntary intoxication and correlation evidence). Concrete text you’d be comfortable publishing in an appellate opinion would be most helpful.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions. Stage 2 must not become a free‑ranging “bad background” story; it must establish substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the moment of offense with converging, pre‑specified proof. Here is how I would translate that into a courtroom rule set that is both scientifically honest and administrable.

1) What counts as sufficient convergence (clear and convincing)
Require all of the following; no single element suffices.

- Event signature (proximate, reactive)
  - Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions of “went blank/seeing red,” autonomic arousal; ideally audio/video or 911/body‑cam corroboration. Evidence of instrumental planning or concealment is disqualifying.

- Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (temporality)
  - Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes (PTSD/IED/dissociation), prior ER contacts for rage episodes, documented chronic sleep disruption. This guards against reverse causation from the case itself.

- Neurocognitive profile with validity
  - At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available.
  - Multiple performance‑validity indices (embedded and stand‑alone) intact; preferably replicate across sessions or show cross‑task convergence. Downweight WCST; it is too nonspecific. Use low‑key trait measures of reactive vs proactive aggression; avoid overreliance on PCL‑R given its misuse and bias risk.

- Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
  - Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD with dissociative features, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response pattern in the offense. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair‑cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

- Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
  - At least one independent, pre‑litigation biomarker: childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or a ≥10 µg/dL peak) during sensitive periods; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; documented FASD risk; or verified early‑life sleep deprivation from environmental conditions. These do not time‑stamp the offense, but they strengthen mechanistic plausibility when paired with current inhibitory deficits.

- Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause exclusions
  - No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (if substances are present, baseline dyscontrol must be shown).
  - Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, malingering (multiple PVTs), and clear instrumental motives.

2) Scientific pitfalls to police (and how)
- State–trait confounds: Standardize testing conditions; where possible repeat or corroborate with pre‑offense records. Recognize that incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance.
- Biomarker over‑interpretation: Treat cortisol (particularly single‑day salivary) as supportive only; hair cortisol offers a 2–3 month window but has ethnicity/hair‑treatment confounds. Historic BLLs are developmental, not moment‑to‑moment.
- Task specificity: Favor motor/affective inhibition tasks over set‑shifting; ensure quality SSRT estimation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple validity checks; be wary of selective or “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Acute intoxication: Keep the traditional rule—voluntary intoxication does not excuse.

3) Admissibility and process guardrails
- Mandatory pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing keyed to a structured proffer addressing each element above; exclude global “RSB” evidence at guilt unless the proffer satisfies the elements.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts under Rule 706 (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Parties may add retained experts, but neutrality is essential for legitimacy.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA/HUD, unemployment records; geocoded residence histories).
- Resource parity orders so indigent defendants can meet the showing; otherwise the doctrine will skew by wealth.
- Rule 403 discipline: if the bundle is partial, reserve it for sentencing; avoid mini‑trials on background in the guilt phase.

4) Offense domain limits
- Presumptively available only for reactive violent offenses (and a narrow slice of truly impulsive nonviolent acts).
- Exclude planned acquisitive crime and offenses exhibiting preparation or concealment.
- Preserve MPC‑style EED in homicide as an “imperfect excuse” pathway when full dyscontrol is not met.

5) Jury instruction (pattern)
- Focus the jury on capacity, not sympathy: “You may consider evidence only insofar as it bears on whether, due to the defendant’s documented developmental exposures and established neurocognitive impairments, his inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of the offense and such degradation was a substantial contributing cause of his immediate, reactive conduct. Background hardship alone is not a defense.”

6) Disposition
- If excused, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions tailored to the proven mechanisms (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports), with risk‑based supervision; reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. If the excuse fails, allow seamless carryover of RSB proof to sentencing mitigation.

Bottom line: Dr. Chen is right—no instrument time‑stamps volitional failure. The law can still reach a clear‑and‑convincing inference by demanding alignment across (1) the event, (2) pre‑offense history, (3) validated inhibitory deficits, (4) clinical linkage, and (5) objective developmental insult, while excluding intoxication and planning. Bake those requirements into a pretrial gate with neutral expertise and tight instructions, and you have a narrow, rule‑governed path that honors Hart’s fairness limit without opening the floodgates.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your evidentiary hat: given Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution bundle (longitudinal deprivation + at least one exposure biomarker + validated executive‑control deficits + event signature of reactive dyscontrol + exclusion of intox/intention), can trial courts administer this without swamping dockets or producing wildly inconsistent rulings? Please be concrete: what pretrial procedure would you mandate (e.g., Daubert‑style hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts, standardized proffer templates, timelines), what limiting principles would you write into the doctrine (reactive violence only, intoxication bar, childhood exposure thresholds), and what jury instruction language would you give to keep the culpability question sharp while preserving public legitimacy?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you. From an administrability-and-error-cost lens, I would echo Dr. Chen on the science and then translate it into a court-usable gate.

1) Specificity and temporal sensitivity
- None of the proposed measures (SSRT/Go–No-Go, Stroop, WCST; cortisol; historic blood lead) is, standing alone, specific to “loss of volitional control,” nor can any time‑stamp impairment to the moment. They are, at best, supportive correlates.
- They become probative only when they converge with contemporaneous, case‑level evidence that the index act bore the signature of reactive dyscontrol (sudden, affective, disorganized, non‑instrumental) and when there is pre‑offense documentation of similar dyscontrol.

2) Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard
I would require all of the following, with a Daubert‑style gatekeeping hearing and neutral, court‑appointed experts:

A. Event‑level signature (contemporaneously corroborated)
- Acute provocation followed within seconds/minutes by conduct that is disorganized, non‑concealed, and inconsistent with planning; 911 audio/body‑worn video/witness statements indicating “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal; no luring, staging, or post‑event instrumental steps. If those instrumental features are present, the excuse should ordinarily fail.

B. Pre‑offense history of dyscontrol (nonforensic records)
- School, pediatric/mental‑health, juvenile‑justice, or employment records predating the offense that document stimulus‑bound explosions, dissociation, or impulse‑control failures (IEPs, ED visits, prior diagnoses or discipline for explosive behavior, chronic sleep disruption tied to environment). Absent such records, meeting the burden should be rare.

C. Valid neurocognitive profile tied to inhibition/affect regulation
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with reliable SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity testing and either re‑test stability or cross‑task convergence. WCST can be included but should be down‑weighted as non‑specific. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available. Trait profile should be inconsistent with predatory aggression (e.g., no moderate–high psychopathic traits).

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A qualified clinician’s diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established with structured instruments, anchored to documented adversities, with triggers/symptoms that plausibly explain the index escalation. Biological measures of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) are supportive but not required and should not be treated as dispositive.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent documentation, predating litigation, of at least one relevant biological exposure (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or any ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; documented FASD risk) or comparable environmental toxin/sleep deprivation evidence; and a plausible link between the exposure and present inhibitory deficits.

F. Exclusions/controls (all must be satisfied)
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute effects.
- No primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; no acute TBI at the time of offense.
- Negative malingering indicators (multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral informants).
- Timing safeguards: testing as early as practicable (ideally within 30–60 days) plus reliance on pre‑offense records to minimize “forensic artifact.”

Scope and charge
- Limit the excuse to genuinely reactive interpersonal violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden on the defense: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

3) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and the stress of arrest/incarceration can depress executive performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions, consider brief re‑testing, and give greatest weight to pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple validity checks; be wary of selective or “too bad to be true” impairment patterns.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication generally defeats an excuse. Distinguish historic “toxin” exposures (lead, FASD) from acute substances.
- Reverse causation and post‑charge artifacts: Hair cortisol can cover a pre‑offense window; historical lab/clinic/school data are the safest anchors.
- Over‑reading biomarkers and imaging: fMRI/EEG have low individual‑diagnostic utility in this context and should, at most, be treated as marginally supportive; judges should give limiting instructions that biomarkers cannot prove mental state.
- PCL‑R misuse: Use trait measures cautiously; a high score undermines a reactive‑dyscontrol account but a low score does not prove one.

4) Institutional guardrails
- Pretrial notice and standardized documentary proffers (geocoded residence/exposure histories; CPS/school/medical/UI/EPA records).
- Neutral experts appointed by the court in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health to reduce partisan shopping.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions to keep juror focus: if automatism‑like involuntariness is not proven, jurors may still consider MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (in homicide) or RSB at sentencing.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; without it, the doctrine risks unequal application.

In sum: Santiago’s Stage 2 elements can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference when they line up across history, mechanism, and moment. The law should not pretend we can measure “volition at T‑0,” but it can demand an automatism‑like profile plus robust, pre‑offense corroboration before excusing. Where the showing falls short of involuntariness, the right home is MPC §210.3 in homicide or structured mitigation at sentencing, not acquittal.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your Daubert/Frye gatekeeper hat: given Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence (event signature, pre‑offense records, validated inhibition tasks like SSRT/antisaccade, chronic stress markers such as hair cortisol, and developmental toxin history like historic BLLs), would you admit this bundle to support a dyscontrol excuse? Please be precise: (i) which elements clear reliability/relevance and which you would exclude or cabin; (ii) whether you’d require a pretrial proffer with court‑appointed neutral experts; and (iii) the limiting instruction you’d give to prevent jurors from over‑inferring “the brain made him do it” and to keep the focus on impairment at the time of offense.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen: no single test or biomarker can time‑stamp volitional failure; the law will need converging proof that (i) this defendant’s inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of this reactive offense. To make that administrable and fair, I would require a tight bundle, proved by the defense by clear and convincing evidence at a pretrial Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing with neutral, court‑appointed experts.

Minimum bundle for Stage 2 attribution
All five of the following, or the motion fails:
1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate, affect‑laden escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment.
- Corroboration where available (911 audio, body‑worn camera, neutral witnesses). If there is evidence of planning or goal‑directed conduct, exclude.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline, pediatric/ED notes, juvenile MH records, prior CPS/trauma documentation). This answers temporality and reduces reverse‑causation risk.

3) Valid neurocognitive profile consistent with impaired inhibition
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below age‑normed means on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and, ideally, cross‑session stability.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (not predatory) aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R, used cautiously).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and phenomenology (dissociation, “seeing red”). Physiologic stress indicators (e.g., hair/diurnal cortisol patterns, low HF‑HRV) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological risk (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse (though it can still be argued at mitigation).
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; consistency across tests and with collateral reports.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, or clear instrumental motives.
- Give little weight to post‑charge fMRI/EEG; admit only as demonstrative support if the core criteria are met.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine); favor pre‑offense records and, where possible, repeat testing.
- “Forensic artifact” problem: heavy reliance on contemporaneous, nonlitigation records (schools, clinics, CPS, housing, EPA labs).
- Over‑interpreting nonspecific markers (cortisol, Stroop) or WCST; these are supportive, not determinative.
- Negative controls (e.g., sibling without exposures) are helpful if available but not required.

Procedural and doctrinal guardrails
- Offense domain: limit to genuinely reactive violent offenses (homicide, aggravated assault) and a narrow class of truly impulsive nonviolent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden/standard: defendant bears clear and convincing evidence on both substantial degradation and substantial contribution.
- Gatekeeping: pretrial Daubert hearing keyed to the elements above; use court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized proffer templates for records (geocoded exposure history, pediatric labs, school/CPS files).
- Jury instruction (sketch): “You may excuse the defendant if you find, by clear and convincing evidence, that at the time of the offense his ability to inhibit impulsive action was substantially impaired by conditions outside his control, and that this impairment was a substantial factor causing his immediate, unplanned reaction to the provoking event. Mere anger, poor judgment, voluntary intoxication, or difficult life circumstances do not suffice.”

Disposition
- If excused, no automatic release: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused care, stable housing, nutrition/sleep interventions, relocation from criminogenic settings, employment supports), with risk‑informed conditions and victims’ input; civil commitment only where statutory criteria of mental illness and dangerousness are met.
- If the excuse fails, RSB remains available for structured mitigation at sentencing.

Why this is governable
- Requiring all five pillars plus exclusions will confine the excuse to a small subset where mechanism, history, and moment align, addressing “floodgates” and expressive‑harm concerns. It tracks Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply—without converting RSB into a general license or justification. Finally, data collection and appellate review should accompany any adoption so we can monitor equity and refine the gate over time.

---

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, building on Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle, what would your gatekeeping and instruction architecture look like to make this administrable and legitimate? Please be concrete: (i) a pretrial Daubert‑style checklist (what must be proffered and by whom; clear‑and‑convincing or preponderance at the hearing?); (ii) disqualifiers (e.g., voluntary intoxication, evidence of planning) and any bright‑line exclusions; and (iii) model jury instruction language that ties dyscontrol to Hart’s “no fair opportunity to conform,” while warning that deprivation per se is insufficient. If you’d trim or add to Chen’s pillars (e.g., downweight WCST, require pre‑offense records), say so—and explain how your design manages error costs and avoids wealth‑based disparities.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

From the bench, I would translate Prof. Santiago’s and Dr. Chen’s science into a tight, administrable gate with two questions: (1) is there reliable, independent evidence that this defendant’s inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of the offense; and (2) is that degradation substantially attributable to documented environmental deprivation, as opposed to voluntary intoxication, predation, or post‑charge artifacts? Nothing in Stage 2 suffices alone; the law should demand convergence.

Admissibility and burden
- Pretrial Daubert hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Offense domain: reactive interpersonal violence with minimal planning; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Burden: clear and convincing evidence that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of offense; and (ii) the degradation was a substantial contributing cause and not self‑induced.

Minimum convergence I would require before sending to a jury
All of the following five pillars; failure of any one is ordinarily fatal:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/staging/cover‑up.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam, witness descriptions of “blanking out,” autonomic arousal). If there is planning or instrumental motive, the excuse should fail.

2) Pre‑offense documentary history of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes, ED visits, CPS) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control or dissociation. This anchors temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal/SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and reasonable stability across sessions.
- A measure indicating impulsive choice (e.g., delay discounting) and low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits to support an impulsive—not predatory—profile.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑assessment diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger, phenomenology, and timing of the index event.
- Stress biomarkers (e.g., hair cortisol showing flattened slope) are supportive but not required; admit as corroboration only.

5) Objective developmental exposure marker consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, ideally with repeated measures or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; FASD risk), predating the offense and plausibly linked to current executive deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse (can consider residual mitigation).
- Malingering checks: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; cross‑source consistency; beware “too bad to be true.”
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, strong instrumental motive.
- Timing safeguards: early testing (within 30–60 days) plus reliance on pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic creation.”

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize conditions, repeat testing, and lean on pre‑offense documentation.
- Reverse causation and ecological fallacies: don’t infer momentary loss of control from neighborhood statistics; the linkage must be individualized.
- Over‑interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI/EEG are not time‑locked or specific; admit, if at all, as background science, not as proof of momentary incapacity.
- PCL‑R misuse and ACEs determinism: use cautiously; neither is dispositive of culpability.
- Base‑rate and confirmation bias: require neutral experts and structured proffers; limit expert testimony to validated inferences.

Procedural guardrails to preserve legitimacy
- Standardized proffer templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA, unemployment records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Notice requirement; capped number of experts per side; court‑appointed neutral where resources are asymmetric.
- Specialized, plain‑English jury instruction defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control,” clarifying that poverty alone is not a defense, and distinguishing reactive dyscontrol from anger, intoxication, or calculated violence.
- Bifurcation where appropriate to keep guilt and excuse evidence in proper lanes.

Disposition if excuse is found
- Noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous under ordinary standards.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 suite, as sharpened by Dr. Chen, can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold only when all five pillars align and disqualifiers are absent. That will be rare and should be. Outside that narrow band, MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance in homicide and structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation and toxin exposure remain the proper channels. This keeps faith with Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit while maintaining administrability and public trust.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming we adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution, can you translate that into a workable pretrial and trial framework? Specifically: (i) would you endorse a Daubert‑style pretrial reliability hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts, and if so, what findings must the judge make to permit the defense to reach the jury; and (ii) could you offer a concise model jury instruction that captures the clear‑and‑convincing burden, the requirement that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and was a substantial contributing cause at the time of the offense, and the categorical disqualifiers (e.g., voluntary intoxication, planning/instrumentality)? Please also flag the biggest evidentiary pitfalls (hearsay in records, Bruton‑type issues, Rule 403 concerns) you would police to prevent mini‑trials and undue prejudice.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Two observations from the bench’s vantage point.

1) What it would take to let a dyscontrol excuse go to a jury
Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage structure is on the right track. Dr. Chen is equally right that none of the proposed instruments can timestamp loss of control. If we are to preserve legitimacy and avoid false positives, I would require a pretrial, Daubert‑style gate with clear‑and‑convincing proof of five converging pillars before any “involuntary‑rage/dyscontrol” instruction is given. In my court, the defense would have to proffer:

- A. Event signature consistent with reactive automatism
  - Minutes/seconds between salient provocation and act; no luring or weapon staging; disorganized, affectively charged conduct; contemporaneous dissociation/“saw red” reports; video/911/bodycam if available. Evidence of planning/cover‑up is ordinarily disqualifying.

- B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
  - Nonforensic records predating the offense reflecting stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline, juvenile/ED notes, prior rage episodes, sleep disruption). This answers temporality and guards against post‑charge artifacts.

- C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity safeguards
  - At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD impaired (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective go/no‑go or affective Stroop), with intact embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests and cross‑session or cross‑task convergence. Downweight WCST; add a delay‑discounting or similar impulsive choice measure. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits to fit an impulsive (not predatory) profile.

- D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the event
  - A qualified clinician’s diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established with structured instruments, anchored to exposures documented long before litigation, with symptom content plausibly explaining the index trigger and response. Stress physiology (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

- E. Objective developmental insult or verified deprivation marker
  - Independent records of at least one biological insult during sensitive periods (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL, ideally repeated, or a single ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk) OR, if no biomarker, a high‑severity trauma profile (e.g., ACEs ≥4 with a severe category plus substantiated CPS/witnessed violence) coupled with B–D above. I would not make a biomarker jurisdictionally indispensable, but its presence substantially strengthens causation.

Disqualifiers and controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse (mitigation may remain).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to the RSB exposures belongs in the insanity framework, not here.
- Malingering safeguards are mandatory (multiple PVTs; collateral informants).
- Testing conditions standardized; heavy reliance on pre‑offense records to avoid reverse‑causation (post‑arrest stress, sleep loss).

Burden and scope:
- Affirmative defense; clear‑and‑convincing evidence.
- Offense domain cabined to reactive violent incidents; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Neutral, court‑appointed experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); no “brain‑scan show‑and‑tell”—functional imaging is, at most, corroborative and subject to Rule 403.

2) How to charge the jury and manage disposition
If the gate is cleared, the jury should get a narrowly tailored instruction modeled on automatism, not a free‑floating “RSB” defense. Elements:

- The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt a voluntary act. If you find, by clear and convincing evidence, that at the time of the act the defendant’s inhibitory control was so substantially degraded that the conduct was not the product of his conscious effort or determination, you must find the act involuntary and return a verdict of not guilty on that count.

A separate, imperfect‑mitigation track remains for homicide under MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance—“from the viewpoint of a person in the actor’s situation”—with careful limiting language to avoid a roving “subculture” license.

Disposition:
- On an automatism acquittal, I would convene a post‑verdict dangerousness hearing (with counsel and neutral experts) to determine conditions of ESB‑oriented supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep interventions, job programs). Civil commitment is available only if statutory criteria (mental illness plus dangerousness) are met; otherwise, use a tightly monitored, problem‑solving‑court model with swift‑certain sanctions for noncompliance. This addresses victim‑protection concerns without converting an excuse into punishment.

Sentencing (when the excuse fails but deprivation is proven):
- Use structured mitigation keyed to verified indicators (e.g., documented childhood BLLs, ACEs, chronic unemployment/housing instability, school deprivation), with an ESB disposition rubric. Keep “societal fault” apportionment out of the guilt phase; it is in tension with criminal law’s attribution project and invites unbounded jury nullification.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police (echoing Dr. Chen):
- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, meds) inflating deficits—require standardized conditions and, where feasible, repeat testing.
- Over‑interpretation of non‑specific biomarkers (cortisol, generic “abnormal” imaging).
- Reverse causation—lean on pre‑charge records.
- Intoxication creep—separate developmental toxins from acute voluntary substance use.

Bottom line
A dyscontrol excuse can be made morally coherent and institutionally governable if it is (i) confined to an automatism‑like niche, (ii) triggered only by a stringent, multi‑pillar showing with neutral expertise, (iii) paired with MPC EED for partial mitigation in homicide, and (iv) otherwise channeled to structured mitigation and ESB at sentencing. That architecture honors Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment absent a fair opportunity to comply—without sacrificing public safety or public confidence.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as the scientific floor, how would you translate it into a concrete gatekeeping and instruction framework? Please specify: (i) what a pretrial Daubert-style proffer must contain (documents, expert types, and disqualifiers like intoxication) to reach the jury; and (ii) a tight, plain‑English jury instruction that confines the excuse to reactive violence with no meaningful planning, requires clear‑and‑convincing proof of substantial loss of inhibitory control at the time, and directs jurors on how to weigh conflicting evidence (e.g., partial planning, mixed motives). Keep it operational—what exactly would the judge say and what would be on the verdict form (complete excuse versus fallback mitigation)?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly in line with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage structure and with Dr. Chen’s cautions. Nothing we have is a time‑stamped meter of “volitional control at T0.” The only way to make this administrable and legitimate is convergence: a tight event signature plus pre‑offense, objective records and valid testing. Here’s how I would cabin Stage 2 for courts.

1) Specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) are the right neighborhood for inhibition; WCST I would downweight. Even the best tasks are trait‑leaning and state‑sensitive; they cannot by themselves prove loss of control at the moment.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic blood lead are supportive of mechanism, not moment. Treat BLLs during sensitive windows as increasing plausibility only in the presence of current inhibitory deficits.
- fMRI/EEG: admissible, if at all, only as background science; do not let glossy images drive a dispositive inference.

2) Minimum convergence to clear and convincing
Require all of the following to get to the jury on a dyscontrol excuse; otherwise, the court should not instruct:

A. Event‑level signature (central)
- Rapid, affective escalation after a salient provocation; minimal planning; confused/disorganized execution; no luring or concealment; contemporaneous accounts of “seeing red/blackout,” autonomic arousal. Where available, video/911/body‑cam corroboration. Any substantial evidence of instrumentality (staging, ambush, post‑event cover‑up) is presumptively disqualifying.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control. This is the best antidote to reverse causation and litigation artifacts.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal, antisaccade error rate, affective Go‑No‑Go/Affective Stroop), with:
  - Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) passed.
  - Replication/cross‑task convergence (or stability across two sessions).
  - Trait profile consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in moderate–high range), used cautiously.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index act
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to pre‑offense exposures and with triggers/symptoms that plausibly explain the index event. Biological stress measures (e.g., flattened hair cortisol over prior 3 months) are supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult (mechanistic plausibility)
- At least one independently documented biological insult predating the offense (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL, ideally repeated or ≥10 once; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), plus environmental records (HUD/EPA lead orders; pediatric labs).

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. Evidence must show baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Rule‑outs: primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, malingering (failures on PVTs), or clear instrumental motive.
- Timing/standardization: testing conducted promptly (ideally within 30–60 days), with standardized conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine) and, where feasible, repetition.

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication changes can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Favor pre‑offense documentation and repeat/triangulate testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity indices; be wary of selective, “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge stress can mimic chronic stress profiles; hair cortisol offers a pre‑offense window; rely on historical records.
- Base‑rate/equity: without indigent funding parity for testing and records collection, the doctrine will skew to the well‑resourced and lose legitimacy.
- Over‑claiming from biomarkers: no single marker proves momentary loss of control; treat all biology as context, never a trump.

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a court checklist mirroring A–E above.
- Neutral panel: court‑appointed neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental‑health experts; consider blinding to some case facts when scoring tests.
- Notice and standardized proffers: geocoded exposure histories; school/CPS/medical/EPA/UI records templates.
- Domain limits: restrict the excuse to reactive interpersonal violence (homicide/attempt/aggravated assault). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes and ambush‑style shootings; channel those to sentencing mitigation.
- Burden: clear and convincing on both substantial degradation of inhibitory control and substantial contribution to the act.

5) Jury handling and disposition
- If the gate is met, use a specialized instruction and special interrogatories (e.g., whether defendant experienced an involuntary reactive dyscontrol that substantially eliminated capacity to inhibit in response to the provoking stimulus; whether non‑self‑induced conditions substantially caused it).
- On a finding of excuse, order noncarceral ESB supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic areas, sleep/nutrition interventions, job pipelines); reserve civil commitment for those who remain dangerous under ordinary civil standards.
- If the gate fails, consider MPC §210.3 extreme emotional disturbance (in homicide) and structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators.

This bundle is demanding by design. Requiring (1) a tight event signature, (2) pre‑offense documentary history, (3) valid inhibition deficits, (4) a diagnosis mapping to the event, and (5) an objective developmental insult—plus exclusion of intoxication and instrumentality—keeps the defense rare and cabined to cases that genuinely trigger Hart’s fairness limit, while preserving public legitimacy and victim protection.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your gatekeeping hat, would you adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage eligibility/attribution screen coupled with Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence as sufficient to let a dyscontrol excuse reach a jury under a clear‑and‑convincing standard? Please be concrete: (i) what pretrial protocol (notice, Daubert hearing scope, neutral expert appointment, limits on admissible measures like fMRI/hair cortisol, exclusion of voluntary intoxication) would you order; and (ii) what short model jury instruction would you give to anchor “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense” and proximate causation, while minimizing prejudice and confusion?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment and proposal

Big picture. Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage structure is the right architecture; Dr. Chen’s cautions about specificity and timing are exactly what a trial court must internalize. None of these instruments time‑stamps volitional failure. The only way to keep this administrable and legitimate is to require convergence across independent lines of proof, tie the doctrine to a narrow offense domain, and use rigorous gatekeeping.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing), before a jury ever hears it

1) Objective developmental exposure anchor (at least one):
- Childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated, or a single ≥10), or residence subject to a documented lead hazard order during childhood; or
- Clinically documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia during sensitive periods; or
- Well‑documented prenatal alcohol/drug exposure consistent with FASD risk.
Why: this supplies a “hard” biologic link between long‑term deprivation and impaired control systems, not merely correlation with poverty.

2) Pre‑offense dyscontrol history (nonforensic, dated before the offense):
- School/juvenile/clinical records showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (IEPs, discipline for explosive reactivity, ED visits for rage/dissociation), or validated trauma history (e.g., substantiated CPS + pre‑charge PTSD/IED diagnosis).
Why: addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact” worries.

3) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol:
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; minimal planning; disorganized execution; contemporaneous witnesses or recordings reflecting “going blank,” marked autonomic arousal, confusion. If there is luring, weapon staging, concealment, or clear instrumental motive, the excuse should presumptively fail.
Why: doctrine limited to reflexive/reactive violence, not instrumental crime.

4) Neurocognitive/clinical profile with validity:
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop/Go‑No‑Go), with multiple performance‑validity tests intact and stability across sessions; plus
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (PTSD—dissociative subtype or Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom content plausibly maps onto the index event; low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits to support an impulsive, not predatory, profile.
Supportive but not required: hair/diurnal cortisol consistent with chronic stress.
Why: provides mechanism and current functional impairment, with malingering safeguards.

And all these disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication that is the proximate driver defeats the excuse.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to the deprivation profile, acute TBI at offense, or strong instrumental motive defeats the excuse.
- Testing done promptly (preferably within 30–60 days) and corroborated by pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls the court should police
- State–trait confounds: sleep loss, acute legal stress, medication changes can depress test performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer repeated/triangulated results; lean on pre‑charge records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; be alert to “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Acute intoxication: don’t let chronic “toxin history” be a back door for alcohol/drug‑driven dyscontrol on the day.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can alter biomarkers; hair cortisol helps establish pre‑offense load; records predating arrest are most probative.
- Over‑interpretation of imaging: fMRI/EEG are, at best, supportive; they should not carry dispositive weight under Daubert.

Offense domain limits and burden
- Limit to reactive interpersonal violence (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts). Exclude planned acquisitive crime and gang‑coordinated violence.
- Defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Procedure and safeguards
- Pretrial Daubert hearing keyed to a structured proffer that tracks the four prongs above; appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Bifurcation: guilt phase first; if liable on elements, a responsibility phase with specialized instructions on dyscontrol (poverty alone is not a defense; anger alone is insufficient; excuse turns on substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of conduct caused by verified deprivation‑linked harms).
- Special verdict form with specific findings (each prong) to aid review and cabin drift.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine is an inequality engine.

Jury instruction (model core)
- “You may consider evidence of severe environmental deprivation and associated developmental harms only if you find that, at the time of the act, as a result of those harms, the defendant lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. Mere poverty, anger, or difficult life circumstances do not suffice. Voluntary intoxication cannot be the proximate cause.”

Disposition
- If excused, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused treatment, safe housing, removal from criminogenic contexts, sleep/nutrition interventions, employment supports), with civil commitment available only upon separate statutory findings of mental illness and dangerousness.
- If the excuse fails, RSB factors belong at sentencing under a validated mitigation framework (lead history, ACEs, chronic unemployment, housing toxins), not at guilt.

Why this won’t open the floodgates
- Requiring both a “hard” developmental exposure and event‑level reactivity, plus valid neurocognitive impairment and pre‑offense documentation, will confine this to a small subset of cases. Most defendants will not clear all four prongs. The Daubert screen, bifurcation, and special verdicts keep the doctrine rule‑bound and reviewable.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 list is directionally sound; I would narrow it to inhibition‑specific tasks with validity checks, treat cortisol as supportive only, and insist on a developmental exposure anchor and pre‑offense records. Dr. Chen is right: the science won’t pinpoint the second of loss of control. Our law can still honor Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply—if we demand convergence, exclude intoxication and planning, and give juries disciplined, cabined instructions.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your evidence-and-administrability hat: do Santiago’s Stage 1–Stage 2 gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence satisfy your “narrow, rule‑governed” criterion? If yes, please sketch the concrete procedural architecture you’d adopt: (i) a pretrial Daubert‑style checklist the court applies to decide if the jury ever hears the excuse; (ii) a short model jury instruction defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and limiting the excuse to reactive violence; and (iii) allocation of burdens and verdict structure (e.g., special interrogatories, bifurcation). Also flag the two highest error‑cost risks you foresee (e.g., malingering, disparate access) and how you’d mitigate them (neutral experts, funding orders, intoxication carve‑outs). Keep it concrete and concise.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Bottom line. None of the proposed instruments is time‑stamped to the moment; each is, at best, a noisy proxy for trait‑level vulnerabilities. They can, however, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment if, and only if, they converge with a reactive event signature and pre‑offense documentation, and if obvious alternative drivers are excluded. Courts should treat Stage 2 as a triangulation-and‑exclusion showing, not a single-test ticket.

Are the proposed measures specific/temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop): probative of inhibitory control; susceptible to state noise (sleep loss, meds, effort). Useful only within a validated battery with performance‑validity checks and preferably replication or cross‑task convergence. WCST is least specific; down‑weight it.
- Stress markers (diurnal or hair cortisol): index chronic load; not specific and influenced by many confounds. Historic childhood blood lead (BLL) is probative of developmental insult if elevated during sensitive windows; it is not a moment‑of‑offense measure.
- Psychiatric diagnosis (PTSD/IED): helpful if established with structured tools and anchored to pre‑offense records; standing alone it is insufficient and vulnerable to post‑hoc inflation.
- fMRI/advanced imaging: admissible, if at all, as background mechanism only; not determinative under Daubert given weak individual‑diagnostic value.

Minimum bundle to satisfy clear‑and‑convincing
I would require all of the following pillars, with no single pillar sufficient:

1) Reactive event signature (sine qua non)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; contemporaneous evidence of dissociation/“seeing red”/autonomic arousal; absence of planning, luring, weapon staging, concealment. Where available, video/911/body‑cam corroboration.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile or primary‑care notes of rage/dissociation, prior ED presentations, sleep disruption). This guards against reverse‑causation and forensic artifact.

3) Neurocognitive battery with validity and convergence
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), intact effort indices (embedded PVTs and stand‑alone), and either replication on a second sitting or cross‑test convergence. Include an impulsive choice measure (delay discounting) if feasible. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy scores to support an impulsive (not predatory) profile.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, IED) by a qualified clinician, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger‑to‑act chain in the instant case. Physiological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol profile) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent documentation of at least one biological exposure (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) temporally predating current deficits and consistent with the measured executive profile.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse (mitigation only).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at the time of offense.
- Strong instrumental motive or planning.
- Malingering: multiple validity failures or “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” patterns; inconsistency across sessions; lack of collateral support.
- Testing completed months after the event without replication or pre‑offense anchors.

Scientific/pedagogical pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, pain, medications, and litigation stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer repeated or corroborated results; rely on pre‑charge records.
- Base‑rate neglect/ecological fallacy: do not infer individual impairment from neighborhood deprivation alone. Individualized proof is essential.
- Adversarial overreach/HARKing: require pre‑specified analytic plans; be wary of post‑hoc rationalizations when initial hypotheses fail.
- Expert shopping and jargon creep: appoint neutral experts; insist on plain‑English explanations linking each datum to the ultimate question.
- Jury confusion about “excuse” vs “justification”: give a tailored instruction that the claim, if proven, excuses because the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to inhibit an impulsive response; it does not declare the conduct right.

Gatekeeping/administrability safeguards
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tethered to a structured checklist mirroring the pillars above.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and standardized proffers (geocoded exposure histories; pediatric/CPS/school/EPA records; toxicology; test protocols with validity indices).
- Offense‑domain limitation: presumptively confined to reactive violent offenses; planned acquisitive crimes out.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; without it, the doctrine is illusory and inequitable.

Instructional standard (for the jury)
- Require the defense to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (i) at the time of the offense, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an impulsive response to a salient provocation was substantially degraded, and (ii) that degradation, stemming from documented developmental adversity/biological insult, was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

With these guardrails, Stage 2 can do what it should in a narrow slice of cases: separate the truly involuntary, reflexive act—where Hart’s fairness limit bites—from the merely difficult choice. This keeps faith with culpability theory, protects victims via tight cabining and ESB‑oriented supervision where an excuse is found, and preserves the administrability and public legitimacy of the criminal process.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume we adopt a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the Santiago/Chen lines. From a trial‑management perspective, what should the gatekeeping order and the jury instruction look like to keep the science within Daubert and the doctrine within bounds? Please specify: (i) admissibility prerequisites you would require (e.g., timing of testing, reliance on pre‑offense records, neutral experts, validity checks, intoxication exclusion), and (ii) a concise model instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense” and the clear‑and‑convincing burden for the jury.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s bottom line: nothing we can practically administer in court “time‑stamps” loss of control. The law can, however, demand a narrow, convergent bundle that makes momentary reactive dyscontrol highly likely and ties it to a documented developmental pathway. For administrability and legitimacy, the showing must be stronger than “harder to comply” and rise to “no fair opportunity to inhibit at the moment,” in Hart’s sense.

What I would require, at a minimum, under a clear‑and‑convincing standard, before the jury ever hears it:

A. Event‑level signature (indispensable)
- Rapid escalation within seconds to a few minutes of a salient provocation; opportunistic rather than staged weapon; disorganized execution.
- No evidence of luring, weapon staging, concealment, or post‑event instrumental behavior.
- Corroboration where possible (video, 911/body‑cam, eyewitnesses) of dissociation markers (“went blank,” “saw red”), autonomic arousal, or post‑event confusion.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (indispensable)
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control: school/IEP or juvenile records, ED/clinic notes for rage/dissociation, documented sleep disruption tied to neighborhood stress. This is the best antidote to reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact” concerns.

C. Neurocognitive battery with validity (supportive but required)
- At least two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go SSRT and an affective variant such as emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus a second domain consistent with poor control (e.g., antisaccade or flanker; optionally delay discounting).
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded + stand‑alone); consistent profiles across sessions or tests; low–moderate psychopathy traits (to support a reactive, not predatory, phenotype).

D. Clinical linkage that maps to the index event (supportive but required)
- A structured DSM‑5 diagnosis consistent with reactive dyscontrol (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), established by a qualified clinician, with symptoms and triggers that plausibly explain the index event.
- Physiological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) may be admitted as supportive only.

E. Objective developmental insult (at least one)
- Historic childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or any prior ≥10), or documented FASD risk, or iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive windows, or comparable verified biological insult (e.g., early lead‑hazard orders, prenatal exposure) that plausibly contributes to present executive deficits.

F. Exclusions/controls (all required)
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (the doctrine should presumptively fail with alcohol/stimulant‑driven behavior).
- Rule out malingering (PVTs, cross‑source consistency), primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, and clear instrumental motives.

Admissibility and procedure
- Pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing keyed to a standardized proffer. Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health to audit methods, validity checks, and nexus; no “battle of experts” by surprise.
- Limit the doctrine to genuinely reactive violent offenses; exclude planned acquisitive crimes by rule. Require clear‑and‑convincing proof that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Bifurcation or a special insanity‑phase analog to avoid swamping the merits jury; tailored limiting instructions if any biomarkers are admitted.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, acute legal stress, or incarceration can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer hair cortisol over single‑day saliva; lean heavily on pre‑offense records; replicate testing when feasible.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple, validated PVTs; watch for “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” or selective impairment; seek collateral informants and cross‑setting consistency.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol and stimulants degrade inhibition; treat voluntary intoxication as defeating the excuse unless the defense can show baseline dyscontrol independent of substance effects.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑charge stress can alter physiology and test performance; insist on documentation that deficits and symptom patterns predate the offense.
- Base‑rate and nexus: Many disadvantaged defendants will meet Stage‑1 adversity; without a particularized nexus to (i) present inhibitory deficits and (ii) the index event’s reactive pattern, the probative value does not exceed Rule 403 risks.
- Ecological validity and cherry‑picking: Lab tasks measure constructs imperfectly; require a pre‑specified battery and convergence across tasks, not one‑off outliers. Downweight WCST; do not overread Stroop alone.
- Neuroimaging seduction: Routine exclusion or strict limitation of fMRI/EEG for single‑subject inference; if admitted at all, only as background mechanism with a limiting instruction—never as a dispositive marker of loss of control.
- PCL‑R misuse/bias: Use trait measures cautiously; avoid over‑reliance given known fairness concerns.

Disposition if the gate is met
- An excuse should be paired with ESB‑oriented, court‑supervised conditions (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pathways). Civil commitment remains available if dangerousness is proven under standard criteria. If the gate is not met, the same evidence can be channeled to structured mitigation at sentencing.

Bottom line
- For guilt, I would not let any single test or biomarker carry the day. The law’s threshold should be a tight, pre‑specified bundle that aligns event, history, and mechanism while excluding common confounds. That, plus neutral experts and a narrow offense domain, keeps us faithful to Hart’s fairness limit without opening the floodgates or compromising public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Dr. Chen sketched a "five‑pillar" bundle plus disqualifiers for a dyscontrol excuse. From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, translate that into a concrete courtroom blueprint: (i) the pretrial admissibility standard (Daubert/Frye and burden), (ii) a model limiting instruction to the jury that separates reactive from instrumental violence and ties causation to the moment, and (iii) offense-domain limits and an explicit rule on voluntary intoxication. Please be precise about burdens of proof (e.g., clear and convincing), required categories of proof, and whether neutral, court‑appointed experts and funding parity should be mandatory. If you think any element is unworkable for juries, say how you would narrow or reframe it.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Two points at the outset. First, nothing we have today can time‑stamp loss of control to the second. Second, courts can still make reliable, case‑level attributions if they require tight convergence: mechanism, history, and moment must line up, and obvious alternative drivers must be excluded. With that lens, I largely endorse Dr. Chen’s cautions and would translate them into administrable gates.

Are the proposed tools specific and temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade; affective variants of Go–No‑Go/Stroop): probative of trait‑level inhibitory control and affect regulation; not dispositive of momentary loss of control. Useful only in a validated battery with performance‑validity tests and, ideally, repeat or cross‑test convergence.
- WCST: too nonspecific; I would downweight or omit.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol): index chronic load; supportive, not determinative; single‑day salivary profiles are noisy.
- Historic blood lead (BLLs), early malnutrition, iron‑deficiency, FASD risk: strengthen developmental plausibility when elevations occurred in sensitive windows and when paired with present‑day inhibitory deficits. They do not speak to the instant act.
- fMRI/EEG: high show, low individual diagnosticity in this context. I would generally exclude at guilt (admit only, if at all, as background science in a Daubert hearing), to avoid over‑interpretation.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing evidence)
All of the following:
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment; contemporaneous observations of dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”), autonomic arousal. Prefer objective corroboration (video/911/bodycam).

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school discipline/IEPs, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/Intermittent Explosive Disorder, ED visits). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), intact embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests, and cross‑session or cross‑test consistency.
- Low–moderate psychopathic traits (to support an impulsive/reactive, not predatory, profile), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the index event (triggers, dissociation). Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation proof of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated or any ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk), plus geocoded/environmental records (lead orders, housing code, school finance) tying exposure to the defendant.

And all of the following exclusions/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication disqualifier: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as the proximate driver defeat the excuse (absent rare involuntariness).
- Malingering safeguards: multiple validity measures; consistency across sessions; collateral informants; beware “too bad to be true.”
- Alternative diagnoses: rule out primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI as the main cause (those invoke different doctrines).
- Planning/instrumentality: evidence of planning, instrumental motive, or concealment should presumptively defeat a dyscontrol excuse.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, pain, legal stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; seek repeat testing; give weight to pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can mimic chronic stress profiles; hair cortisol (segmenting pre‑offense months) and historic pediatric labs help.
- Base‑rate neglect: many disadvantaged defendants will meet Stage 1; without Stage 2 alignment their cases belong at sentencing, not at guilt.
- Halo effects of neuroimagery: exclude or cabin fMRI/EEG; do not allow scans to substitute for functional evidence.
- Overbreadth: confine the excuse to affective/reactive violent offenses; channel property/planned crimes to mitigation.

Gatekeeping and procedure (to keep the channel narrow and fair)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing on a structured proffer tied to the elements above; appoint neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Strict notice and standardized documentation (pediatric BLLs; CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD, unemployment records; geocoded exposure timelines).
- Bifurcation/scope control: in the guilt phase admit only evidence necessary to prove the elements (event signature, pre‑offense dyscontrol, tightly cabined expert testimony). Reserve broader social‑history evidence for sentencing.
- Jury instruction (model): “If you find by clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the act, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit reflexive aggression was substantially impaired due to neurodevelopmental insults and chronic adversity, and that this impairment was a substantial factor causing the act, you must find the defendant not guilty by reason of involuntary dyscontrol. Voluntary intoxication alone is not an excuse. Evidence of planning or instrumental motive defeats this defense.”

Disposition
- If excused: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused treatment, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines); civil commitment only if current dangerousness and mental illness are shown.
- If the defense fails but exposures are verified: instruct on MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance in homicide; otherwise reserve the record for structured mitigation at sentencing.

Bottom line: The Santiago/Chen framework is workable if courts insist on convergence across these pillars and hold a hard line on planning, intoxication, and malingering. That keeps faith with Hart’s fairness limit while controlling error costs and preserving public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two-stage framework and Dr. Chen’s cautions as givens, could you draft a concrete, short model jury instruction for a dyscontrol-based RSB excuse that is workable in a trial court? Please define “substantial impairment of volitional control” in reactive cases, lay out the elements the defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence, specify disqualifiers (e.g., voluntary intoxication, planning/instrumental motives), and tell jurors what kinds of evidence they may consider (neurocognitive tests with validity checks, pre-offense records, exposure biomarkers, event-level testimony) and how to weigh convergence versus any single test. Keep it tight—2–3 paragraphs that a trial judge could realistically read to a jury.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Chair, I agree with Prof. Santiago’s basic architecture and with Dr. Chen’s scientific cautions. If we are to run a dyscontrol excuse at guilt without losing the plot, the court must demand tight convergence and do the heavy lifting at a pretrial Rule 104/Daubert hearing. No single test or marker time‑stamps loss of control; the law must therefore insist on alignment across history, mechanism, and the moment, and exclude cases that look remotely planned or intoxication‑driven.

My recommended gate, keyed to clear and convincing proof and limited to reactive interpersonal violence:

1) Offense signature (event‑level)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; seconds/minutes, not hours.
- Disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment.
- Contemporaneous observations (witness/video/911/body‑cam) of dissociation or autonomic arousal (“went blank,” shaking, rapid breathing).
- Disqualifiers: evident planning, post‑event instrumental conduct, substantial voluntary intoxication.

2) Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records showing episodic dyscontrol: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile or clinical notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption tied to environmental stressors.
- This guards against reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact.”

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity (mechanism)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), administered within 60–90 days, with multiple performance‑validity tests and, where feasible, re‑testing or cross‑task convergence.
- Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting).
- Low/moderate psychopathic traits (to distinguish reactive from predatory).

4) Psychiatric linkage (bridge from exposure to moment)
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician of a trauma/impulse‑control disorder (PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom content and triggers that plausibly map onto the index event.
- Biological stress corroborants (e.g., hair cortisol blunting) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult (etiology)
- At least one independently documented exposure consistent with prefrontal control vulnerability: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or prior ≥10), documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk; plus, where available, housing/EPA/CPS/medical records anchoring timing.

6) Alternative‑cause exclusion
- Toxicology to rule out acute voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver.
- Screen for primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI; if present and unrelated to RSB, this is a different doctrine.
- Malingering safeguards: embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; collateral informants; consistency across sessions.

Scientific/legal pitfalls the court should police
- State–trait confounds: sleep loss, meds, acute legal stress depress performance and cortisol; standardize testing, consider actigraphy, and lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering and “brain overclaim”: require performance validity; down‑weight WCST; exclude glossy fMRI unless tied to accepted clinical indications; admit EEG only for bona fide seizure disorders.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: group correlations (neighborhood, school) are Stage‑1 context; they do not prove Stage‑2 causation without the individual linkage above.
- Intoxication creep: voluntary alcohol/drug effects should presumptively defeat the excuse.
- Dueling experts: appoint neutral court experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health); require a structured proffer keyed to these elements.

Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing with written findings on each element; no jury hears Stage‑2 science absent a prima facie showing.
- Special, bifurcated submission and a special interrogatory: did defendant prove by clear and convincing evidence that (a) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (b) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act?
- Limit domain to reactive violent offenses against the person; presumptively exclude acquisitive/planned crimes.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will be both rare and inequitable.
- Rule 403 vigilance to keep the trial from becoming a referendum on poverty writ large.

Disposition
- If excused, enter a special verdict (“not guilty by reason of involuntary dyscontrol”) and hold a separate ESB disposition hearing: trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment pipelines, and close judicial supervision. Civil commitment remains available only where statutory mental‑illness criteria are met; otherwise use ESB with tight compliance monitoring to address victim‑safety concerns.

Bottom line
With these gates, the defense remains a narrow avenue for the top tail of cumulative adversity where mechanism and moment genuinely line up. Most RSB evidence should continue to do its work at sentencing (and, in homicide, within MPC‑style EED). But where Hart’s fairness limit is truly met—no fair opportunity to comply at the moment—the law should be able to say so, carefully.

### Speaker: Host

Assume we recognize a narrow dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse along the lines Santiago/Chen outlined. Please draft a model jury instruction that (a) states the elements the defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence; (b) lists disqualifiers (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, planning/instrumental motive, malingering); and (c) uses plain language to define “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense.” Include special‑verdict interrogatories you would require the jury to answer to preserve review and doctrinal discipline.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Bottom line. Stage 2 must do two things the science alone cannot: (i) tether mechanism to the moment, and (ii) keep juries from being swamped by group-to-individual leaps. No single test or biomarker suffices; admissibility should turn on a convergent, pre‑specified bundle vetted at a pretrial hearing, with neutral experts, and limited to reactive violence.

On the proposed tools

- Specificity/temporal sensitivity:
  - Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go; affective Stroop; antisaccade) are probative of trait‑level inhibitory weakness, not second‑by‑second loss of control. Useful only as part of a bundle and with performance‑validity checks.
  - WCST is too nonspecific; I would downweight or exclude it as a core element.
  - Stress markers (hair cortisol; diurnal salivary profiles) index chronic load; historical blood lead (BLLs) speaks to developmental insult. None time‑stamps impairment at offense, but they strengthen plausibility if paired with pre‑offense records and present‑day deficits.
  - fMRI should be excluded or, at most, admitted as background science; its courtroom “wow factor” outstrips forensics utility.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)

Require all of A–D and the exclusions in E:

A. Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/staging/cover‑up. Prefer corroboration (video/911/bodycam; neutral witnesses). If planning or instrumental motive appears, the excuse fails.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity; prior ED/clinic notes; juvenile files). This addresses temporality and the G2i problem.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal reaction time; affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop; antisaccade), plus intact effort indices (multiple stand‑alone and embedded PVTs). Prefer replication across sessions or cross‑task convergence. Avoid heavy reliance on WCST; treat PCL‑R cautiously (only to exclude predatory profile).

D. Mechanistic linkage
- A DSM‑5 trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established with structured tools, whose triggers/symptoms plausibly map onto the index event; and
- At least one objectively documented developmental insult consistent with the mechanism (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or one ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk), or robust ACEs corroborated by records, with dose‑response logic to the measured deficits.

E. Exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, baseline dyscontrol must be independently shown and intoxication shown not to be the substantial cause.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, and malingering (multiple PVTs; consistency across time/collaterals).
- Testing as early as practicable (30–90 days), standardized for sleep/meds; triangulate with pre‑offense data to minimize incarceration‑artifact effects.

Judicial guardrails (administrability)

- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with a structured checklist; appoint court‑neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health). Exclude evidence that fails general‑acceptance/fit or risks Rule 403 confusion.
- Offense domain: confine to affective/reactive violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes and felony‑murder theories.
- Burden/standard: defense bears clear and convincing evidence that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Equity: ensure defense access to testing/records; otherwise the doctrine becomes class‑skewed.

Pitfalls to police

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, pain, legal stress can depress performance/cortisol. Standardize testing; prefer hair cortisol over single‑day salivary; replicate where feasible.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple, independent validity measures; beware selective, “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense incarceration/stress can flatten cortisol and impair testing; lean on pre‑offense documentation.
- Cultural/linguistic bias: use appropriate norms/translation; otherwise apparent “deficits” may be artifacts.
- Over‑read PCL‑R and WCST; under‑read collateral, time‑locked event data. Event phenomenology plus pre‑offense history carry the most legal weight.

Jury management

- If the gate is passed, give a tight, pattern instruction: the question is fair opportunity to conform at the moment, not whether the defendant faced hardship writ large. Use special interrogatories on each element to preserve focus and appellate review.

This approach keeps the gate narrow, aligns with Hart’s fairness limit, and is administrable: a handful of cases will clear it; many will be channeled to mitigation at sentencing.

### Speaker: Host

Judge, suppose a jurisdiction adopts a narrow dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse along the lines of Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle. If you were drafting a model gatekeeping order and jury instructions, what exactly would you: (a) require and (b) exclude at the Daubert hearing (e.g., neutral experts, pre‑offense records, specific tests/biomarkers), and how would you charge the jury on “substantial impairment” and “substantial contribution” to minimize error costs and avoid de facto nullification? Please also state the offense domain and burden of proof you would set.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Attribution to “substantial volitional impairment at the moment of offense” has to rest on converging, pre‑specified indicia. None of the proposed measures (SSRT, Stroop, WCST, cortisol, historic BLLs) can time‑stamp control failure; their proper role is corroborative. I would admit them under a tight Daubert gate and require a structured, multi‑pillar showing, with clear‑and‑convincing proof, limited to genuinely reactive violence.

1) Sufficiency and specificity of the proposed tools
- Neurocognitive batteries
  - Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with valid SSRT), antisaccade, and an affective inhibition task are probative of inhibitory control; Stroop and WCST are lower‑specificity adjuncts. All are state‑sensitive; results must be replicated or triangulated and paired with performance‑validity testing.
  - Use PCL‑R (or alternatives) cautiously to exclude predatory profiles; a high score should count strongly against the excuse.
- Stress/Exposure markers
  - Historic BLLs and early malnutrition are objective, developmentally salient exposures that increase plausibility; they are not moment‑level indices.
  - Diurnal or hair cortisol supports chronic stress but is nonspecific and vulnerable to confounds; admissible as supportive only.
  - I would exclude individual‑level fMRI for attribution; current error rates and inferential gaps are too great for courtroom timing or causation.

2) Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard (all must be present)
A. Event signature and contemporaneous corroboration
- Acute, salient provocation; seconds‑to‑minutes escalation; disorganized execution; no staging/cover‑up; neutral contemporaneous evidence (video, 911 audio, body‑cam, bystander reports) of dissociation/“went blank,” autonomic arousal. Any evidence of planning, luring, or post‑event instrumental steps is presumptively disqualifying.

B. Pre‑offense history of dyscontrol (non‑forensic)
- School/juvenile mental‑health/medical records predating the incident reflecting stimulus‑bound rage, dissociation, or explosive outbursts; sleep disruption tied to neighborhood stressors; not created for litigation.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity safeguards
- ≥1.5–2.0 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), plus an impulsive choice measure (delay discounting), with intact effort indices (multiple PVTs/embedded measures) and either replication across sessions or cross‑test convergence.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented adversities; symptom triggers plausibly align with the offense; low–moderate psychopathy traits.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent proof of at least one: repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (or any ≥10), early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure; temporally prior to the measured deficits.

And all of the following exclusions/controls:
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; if substances were present, defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- No primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; no acute TBI explaining the act; consistency across collateral sources to mitigate malingering/secondary gain.
- Testing performed promptly (ideally within 30–60 days), recognizing state effects, and anchored by pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact” profiles.

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: sleep loss, meds, pain, and incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol; standardize conditions and, where possible, repeat testing.
- Malingering/over‑reporting: require multiple performance‑validity tests and collateral informants; be wary of selective or “too bad to be true” deficits.
- Acute intoxication: a common confound; voluntary intoxication should generally defeat a dyscontrol excuse.
- Ecological/base‑rate errors: residence in a high‑deprivation tract does not establish individual causation; tether opinions to individual records and measures.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge stress can create biomarker changes; favor pre‑charge documentation (pediatric labs, school files, CPS, EPA/HUD records).

4) Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to the above pillars; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Standardized proffer templates for records (geocoded residence history; school, CPS, housing, UI, and medical/toxin data).
- Limiting domain to reactive interpersonal violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Jury instruction distinguishing this narrow excuse (loss of inhibitory control rendering the act not the product of conscious effort or determination) from mere hot anger; channel close cases to MPC‑style EED (homicide) or sentencing mitigation rather than full exculpation.

Bottom line: with this bundle—and only with this bundle—the inference that the defendant’s volitional control was substantially degraded at the time of the act can responsibly reach “highly probable.” Outside of it, the evidence should be used, at most, for EED in homicide and for structured mitigation at sentencing tied to verified deprivation indicators. This preserves Hart’s fairness limit while keeping the doctrine narrow, administrable, and credible to juries and victims alike.

### Speaker: Host

Assume a jurisdiction adopts a narrowly tailored dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse along the lines Prof. Santiago and Dr. Chen sketched. From an administrability standpoint, what is your best design for how the issue reaches and is decided by the jury? Please offer (i) whether you would bifurcate (guilt first, then an RSB excuse phase) and why; (ii) a short model jury instruction that ties the moral question to Hart’s “no fair opportunity to comply” and confines it to reactive, non‑instrumental conduct; and (iii) a special verdict form with interrogatories (e.g., event signature, planning, intoxication, validity of testing, substantial degradation of inhibitory control, causation). Feel free to specify categorical exclusions (e.g., voluntary intoxication, planned acquisitive crime) and evidentiary limits (e.g., fMRI allowed only as supportive). The aim is to give trial courts a decision tree that is tight enough to avoid sympathy spillover and floodgates, but still lets meritorious cases through—and to surface where you see the highest error‑cost risks.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is the right direction: courts should demand convergence across mechanism, history, and the moment. But we must translate that science into administrable evidentiary rules that keep the gate tight and the trial focused.

What the court should accept (corroborative, not dispositive)
- Event signature (most probative): Near‑immediate, affective escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; no luring or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions of “seeing red,” dissociation, autonomic arousal. Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam audio).
- Pre‑offense history (anchors temporality): Non‑forensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control—school IEP/discipline for explosive behavior, prior ED visits for rage episodes, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation, sleep disruption. This mitigates reverse‑causation concerns.
- Neurocognitive testing (with validity checks): Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks that actually target the mechanism (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with intact performance‑validity tests and stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence. WCST and classic Stroop get little weight; they are too nonspecific.
- Psychiatric linkage: A structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) that plausibly maps onto the index event, grounded in pre‑offense exposures and records. Use PCL‑R/trait measures cautiously—supportive if low/moderate, but not gatekeeping.
- Exposure biomarker (developmental insult): Childhood blood‑lead history (ideally repeated, ≥5 µg/dL; ≥10 is stronger), iron‑deficiency/malnutrition markers, or well‑documented FASD risk—independent of litigation. Hair/diurnal cortisol can support chronic stress but is neither specific nor time‑stamping.

What the court should be wary of (and often exclude)
- fMRI/advanced neuroimaging as proof of momentary dyscontrol—exclude absent stipulation; at most, it shows group‑level tendencies and invites over‑interpretation (Daubert “fit” and Rule 403).
- Single‑day cortisol profiles; noisy and state‑sensitive. Hair cortisol is better for a pre‑offense window but still only supportive.
- WCST‑only “executive” claims; poor specificity to inhibitory control.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
Require all five pillars below; no single item suffices:
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol (and not instrumental conduct).
2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (non‑forensic).
3) Neurocognitive evidence: ≥2 targeted inhibition/affect‑regulation deficits with valid effort indices and cross‑task convergence.
4) Psychiatric diagnosis linking exposures to the index pattern (structured tools; collateral records).
5) At least one objective developmental exposure biomarker consistent with the mechanism (e.g., childhood BLLs), with dose‑response coherence (more exposure, worse inhibition).

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances are present, defendant must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Evidence of planning, luring, weapon staging, or concealment defeats “reactive” characterization.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; inconsistency across sessions should be disqualifying.
- Primary psychosis/mania (unless proceeding under a different insanity framework); acute TBI at offense.
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing (sleep, meds), and lean on pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Procedural guardrails (administrability and equality)
- Rule 104(a)/Daubert‑style pretrial hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above; the judge rules on scientific reliability (known error rates, norms, peer review) and legal “fit.”
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; ensure funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Notice and standardized discovery templates (medical labs, CPS/school, housing/EPA/HUD, unemployment records; geocoded residency history).
- Offense limitation: confine the excuse to reactive violent offenses and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.

Legal standard and instruction
- Burden: clear and convincing evidence that (i) defendant’s capacity to inhibit or control conduct was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act, independent of voluntary intoxication.
- Sample instruction (for jurisdictions recognizing an automatism‑like excuse):
  “If you find the defendant experienced an involuntary episode of reactive dyscontrol, such that, because of a documented history of severe environmental deprivation and its effects, he lacked substantial capacity to control his conduct at the time of the act, and that this condition substantially caused the act, you must return a verdict of not guilty by reason of involuntary act. If you are not persuaded by clear and convincing evidence, you must proceed to consider the charged offense and any lesser‑included offenses.”

Disposition
- Where the excuse is found, I favor noncarceral ESB supervision orders (trauma‑focused therapy, safe‑housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports) with risk‑appropriate monitoring; resort to civil commitment only where statutory criteria are met.

Bottom line
Santiago’s and Chen’s frameworks can be made governable if courts treat the science as corroboration, not time‑stamping; insist on pre‑offense documentation; exclude speculative biomarkers; and apply a strict, multi‑pillar gate. That preserves Hart’s fairness limit without opening the floodgates or eroding the protection owed to victims and communities.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Prof. Santiago’s and Dr. Chen’s bundle into courtroom practice? Specifically: (1) What would your Daubert/Rule 403 rulings look like on each class of evidence (historic BLL labs, hair/diurnal cortisol, SSRT/Go–No-Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop, WCST, PCL‑R, fMRI), and would you categorically exclude any (e.g., WCST as too nonspecific, PCL‑R as prejudicial, fMRI as insufficiently individualized)? (2) Would you require a pretrial proffer and court‑appointed neutral experts, and how would you structure bifurcation to keep guilt determinations clean? (3) Could you sketch model jury instructions defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause,” plus bright‑line disqualifiers (voluntary intoxication, planning/cover‑up) so jurors don’t wander? Please be concrete about burdens and limiting the doctrine to reactive violence to preserve legitimacy.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Broad view. I agree with Dr. Chen: none of the proposed measures is either specific or time‑stamped enough on its own. Stage 2 must demand tight convergence between (a) the way the event unfolded, (b) pre‑offense documentation, and (c) credible, validity‑checked testing that fits a recognized mechanism. Courts should treat the batteries and biomarkers as supporting cast. The linchpin is contemporaneous evidence that the index act was a reactive, affect‑driven failure of control—not an instrumental choice.

Temporal sensitivity. Because lab tasks and chronic‑stress markers are trait‑leaning, the bridge to “this moment” must come from near‑event evidence:
- Video/body‑cam/911 audio, eyewitness accounts, and immediate statements (“went blank,” “saw red”), plus disorganized, non‑concealing behavior.
- Where available, contemporaneous autonomic signs (EMS vitals, visible tremor/tears), but these are supportive, not required.

Minimum bundle for a clear‑and‑convincing showing. I would require all of the following (no single pillar suffices):

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation after a salient provocation; seconds/minutes between trigger and act; no luring/preparation/concealment; post‑event confusion or shutdown. Any meaningful planning or instrumental motive should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense history predating the incident
- Nonforensic records evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, prior ED visits for rage/dissociation, juvenile MH notes), sleep disruption tied to environment. This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity and convergence
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, an affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and either test‑retest stability or cross‑task convergence.
- Include an impulsive choice measure (delay discounting) and downweight WCST (set‑shifting, not specific). Low–moderate psychopathy traits to support an impulsive/reactive (not predatory) profile.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures; symptom triggers plausibly explain the index act. The diagnosis must not be created ex nihilo for litigation.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- At least one documented, pre‑litigation biological insult (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or any ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; prenatal alcohol risk; chronic sleep deprivation corroborated by collateral records). Historic BLLs strengthen plausibility; they do not time‑stamp the event.

6) Exclusion of alternative proximate causes
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the primary driver (defense should fail if so).
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, and malingering (multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity checks; consistency across sessions and informants).

Supportive but not required:
- Hair cortisol (3‑month window) or flattened diurnal slope as corroboration of chronic stress (mindful of confounds—hair treatment, ethnicity).
- HRV/threat‑potentiated startle as mechanism‑consistent physiology.

Scientific pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication, legal stress can depress task performance and flatten cortisol; standardize conditions, consider actigraphy, and lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity measures; beware selective, “too bad to be true” deficits.
- Acute intoxication: separates from admissible “toxin history.” Voluntary intoxication should generally defeat the excuse.
- Reverse causation: post‑arrest stress and incarceration can alter biomarkers and testing; prefer pre‑charge documentation and hair cortisol for pre‑incident windows.
- Ecological/base‑rate errors: high adversity is common in dockets; demand case‑specific incremental probative value, not population correlation.
- Over‑interpretation of shiny tools: fMRI/EEG and generic WCST deficits are low‑specificity; admit, if at all, as modestly probative under a limiting instruction.
- PCL‑R misuse: avoid branding; use cautiously and only to distinguish reactive from predatory patterns.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and fairness)
- Pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing tied to a structured proffer addressing each pillar; FRE 403 balancing to exclude confusing or marginally probative science.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); limit party experts; standardized report templates; timelines (testing within 60–90 days where feasible).
- Constrain offense domain: reactive violent offenses (and, in rare instances, truly impulsive nonviolent acts). Exclude planned acquisitive crime by rule.
- Burden: clear and convincing evidence on substantial degradation of inhibitory control and substantial causal contribution to the act.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; protective orders and streamlined subpoenas for CPS/school/housing/EPA records.

Doctrinal channeling and instructions
- Channel grants into existing boxes: (i) complete excuse (automatism) where control loss was involuntary; (ii) MPC‑style EED to mitigate homicide where impairment was substantial but not total; (iii) otherwise, sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/biological indicators. Use bifurcation and specialized jury instructions to keep issues distinct and preserve legitimacy.

Bottom line. Properly cabined, Stage 2 can support a narrow dyscontrol excuse. The court should insist on contemporaneous event evidence plus pre‑offense records, validity‑checked inhibitory deficits, a documented developmental insult, a fitting diagnosis, and exclusion of proximate alternative causes. Anything less risks converting population correlation into case‑level exculpation, which neither the science nor the law can bear.

### Speaker: Host

Putting Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence into courtroom practice: if you were drafting a model rule and jury instruction for a narrow RSB‑dyscontrol excuse, which elements would you deem admissible and how would you frame them for the jury (e.g., “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause”)? Please specify any bright‑line disqualifiers (planned/instrumental crimes, substantial voluntary intoxication), your Daubert gate (neutral experts, standardized proffers, limits on PCL‑R, hair cortisol/BLL as supportive only), and whether you’d require bifurcation to keep mens rea distinct from the excuse. Key aim: minimize false positives and disparate application while keeping the doctrine usable for the rare, strong case.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

From the bench’s vantage, Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally right, and Dr. Chen’s cautions are exactly the ones that matter for adjudication. The science will not time‑stamp loss of control; courts must therefore demand tight alignment across history, mechanism, and the moment, and police alternative explanations. Here is how I would operationalize Stage 2 into a workable, floodgate‑resistant gatekeeping and proof regime.

1) Offense‑domain and burden
- Applicability: narrowly to reactive, affective interpersonal violence (and, in truly exceptional cases, impulsive nonviolent outbursts). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes and offenses with clear instrumental preparation.
- Burden/standard: defense bears clear and convincing evidence that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.
- Voluntary intoxication: ordinarily disqualifying as a proximate cause.

2) Pretrial gatekeeping (Daubert/Frye hearing with neutral experts)
- Court‑appointed neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental‑health experts; raw data production and independent re‑testing permitted.
- Structured proffer tied to defined elements; no jury instruction unless all elements are met.

3) Required Stage‑2 convergence (minimum bundle)
All five pillars must be present; none alone suffices:

A. Event signature (moment)
- Acute provocation; seconds–minutes to offense; disorganized execution; no luring or concealment; contemporaneous indicia of autonomic arousal/dissociation (witness, video, 911/body‑cam). Any credible planning or instrumental motive defeats this pillar.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the charge evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits for rage episodes, documented chronic sleep disruption).

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity (mechanism)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD impaired (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indices and reasonable stability across sessions; include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting). Low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits to fit a reactive, not predatory, profile.

D. Clinical linkage (diagnosis mapping to event)
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, or comparable), anchored to Stage‑1 exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the trigger and response. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive, not required.

E. Objective exposure biomarker (developmental insult)
- At least one non‑litigation exposure marker consistent with prefrontal/affect‑regulation compromise: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or any ≥10), documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk; strengthens causal plausibility when paired with C and D.

4) Disqualifiers/alternative‑cause controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication proximate to the act; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the time; malingering (failed PVTs); clear instrumental motive.
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing conditions; prefer corroboration/re‑testing; weight pre‑offense records heavily to avoid reverse‑causation (post‑incarceration stress artifacts).

5) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- Over‑interpretation of broad executive measures (WCST) or single‑day salivary cortisol; favor domain‑relevant tasks and, for chronic stress, hair cortisol over diurnal spot checks.
- P‑hacking and hired‑gun risks: require preregistered test batteries where feasible; insist on disclosure of all administered measures and raw data.
- Base‑rate neglect: many disadvantaged defendants will show some deficits; the event‑level signature and temporality are the discriminators.

6) Jury management and instructions
- Bifurcate where possible: guilt with narrowly tailored dyscontrol instruction only if the court has found the elements; otherwise, reserve broader RSB material for sentencing.
- Model instruction (sketch): “If you find by clear and convincing evidence that, at the time of the act, defendant’s capacity to inhibit an otherwise unlawful response was substantially degraded, and that this degradation—arising from documented developmental exposures—was a substantial contributing cause of a reactive, unplanned assault, and not the product of voluntary intoxication or calculated purpose, you must return a verdict of not guilty by reason of dyscontrol.”
- Special verdict form with element‑by‑element findings to preserve transparency and review.

7) Disposition safeguards (post‑verdict)
- ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pathways) under court supervision; periodic danger reviews.
- Civil commitment available where statutory criteria are met (dangerousness with mental disorder); otherwise, ESB with graduated sanctions for noncompliance.

8) Equality and resources
- The doctrine must be funded: indigent defendants need access to testing, records retrieval, and neutral experts; otherwise, we create a defense only the well‑resourced can mount.

Bottom line: With these guardrails, the Stage‑2 attribution can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a narrow slice of cases—those where the moment, the history, and the mechanism line up, and alternative causes are credibly excluded. That keeps faith with Hart’s “fair opportunity to comply” limit while preserving administrability and public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your evidence-and-instructions hat, could you draft the core jury instruction you would give for a narrowly tailored dyscontrol-based RSB excuse? Please provide concise, pattern-style language that (i) places a clear-and-convincing burden on the defense, (ii) defines “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” tied to the instant act, (iii) limits applicability to reactive (not planned) offenses, (iv) requires convergence of event-level signs and pre‑offense documentation, and (v) expressly excludes voluntary intoxication and mere hardship as sufficient. Keep it tight—one instruction a trial judge could actually read.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery: Two reactions, one scientific-administrative and one doctrinal.

1) On the science Dr. Chen and Prof. Santiago propose
- No single instrument can time‑stamp loss of control. The only way this is tolerable in a court of law is by demanding convergence across independent strands, with heavy weight on pre‑offense documentation and the event’s signature. I would trim the battery to what bears directly on inhibition under affect:
  - Keep: Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (with credible SSRT), antisaccade, an affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop variant, and a delay‑discounting task. Require multiple performance‑validity tests and—where feasible—retest or cross‑task stability.
  - Down‑weight: WCST (set‑shifting; nonspecific), trait instruments that are easily weaponized (e.g., PCL‑R) except to exclude predatory profiles and only with caution.
  - Stress/biologic markers: childhood BLLs in the record are probative of developmental prefrontal insult; hair cortisol (3‑month window) is more useful than single‑day salivary profiles but is still supportive, not dispositive. HRV/startle can support an affect‑regulation mechanism. None of these should be outcome‑determinative.

2) Minimum bundle to reach clear and convincing
Require all five pillars; no single pillar suffices, and failure on any one is presumptively fatal unless there is extraordinary strength elsewhere (and even then, I would not relax intoxication or planning disqualifiers):

A. Event signature (must have)
- Rapid escalation after a salient provocation; seconds or minutes, not hours.
- Disorganized execution; no credible evidence of luring, weapon staging, concealment, or post‑event instrumental behavior.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/bodycam/witness) of dissociation/“saw red”/marked autonomic arousal or confusion.

B. Pre‑offense history (must have)
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing episodic, stimulus‑bound dyscontrol: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, longstanding sleep disruption, etc. This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation.

C. Neurocognitive evidence (must have)
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Affective Stroop), with intact effort validity and—ideally—consistency across sessions or converging tasks.

D. Clinical linkage (must have)
- Structured‑interview diagnosis that maps to the index event (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented adversities; symptom content plausibly explains trigger and response.

E. Objective exposure biomarker (must have one)
- Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (repeated, or a single ≥10), or documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or credible FASD risk—independent of litigation—with a plausible link to current inhibitory deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication proximate to the offense defeats the excuse. If substances are present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; in practice this will rarely be met.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; look for “too bad to be true” or selective impairment patterns; compare across sessions.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless the psychosis doctrine is squarely in play), acute TBI at the time of offense, and clear instrumental motives.
- Timing: testing within 30–60 days if possible; rely heavily on pre‑offense records to avoid forensic‑artifact effects of incarceration stress.

3) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, legal stress can transiently depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; use actigraphy/collateral sleep documentation where feasible; prefer replication and pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense stress can create the very profiles offered as proof. Hair cortisol helps with pre‑offense windows; historical pediatric/school/CPS/EPA records are best.
- Ecological fallacy/zip‑code stereotyping: neighborhood deprivation shows risk, not individual impairment. Treat Stage 1 as eligibility background; do not let it carry Stage 2.
- Over‑interpretation of neurotech: fMRI/EEG add color but not case‑level specificity; admit only, if at all, as corroborative under a tight Daubert/Kumho screen.
- PCL‑R misuse: it is not a dyscontrol gauge; use cautiously, if at all, to exclude predatory patterns, mindful of known biases.

4) Administrability guardrails
- Narrow offense domain: limit to reactive violent offenses (and the rare impulsive nonviolent act with an acute trigger). Exclude planned acquisitive crime, felony‑murder predicated on preparation, and cases with concealment.
- Burden and procedure: clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; early, structured Daubert/Kumho hearing keyed to the five pillars; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; notice and standardized documentary proffers (medical labs, school/CPS, housing/EPA, UI, geocoded history).
- Bifurcation and instructions: try guilt first; if the gate is passed, give a specialized instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause,” with a special verdict form requiring yes/no findings on each pillar. If the excuse fails, permit the same evidence for sentencing mitigation under calibrated guidelines.
- Intoxication rule: make the intoxication bar explicit to reduce noise and gamesmanship.
- Funding parity: appoint experts and fund testing for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine becomes class‑skewed and illegitimate.

5) Disposition
Where the excuse is found, I favor ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused treatment, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports), with civil commitment available if the person remains demonstrably dangerous. That both honors Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply—and addresses public‑safety and victim‑respect concerns.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 list is directionally right. Courts should tighten it to an “all‑pillars” test, exclude intoxication and instrumental cases, and police the scientific pitfalls Dr. Chen identified. If we hold that line, the doctrine will be rare, evidence‑driven, and governable.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions as givens, could you draft a concrete, courtroom‑ready model jury instruction for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse? Please include: (i) the definition of “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” tied to the moment of offense; (ii) the causation standard (e.g., a substantial contributing cause) linking cumulative deprivation/biological insults to that impairment; (iii) explicit exclusions (e.g., voluntary intoxication as proximate driver, planned/instrumental conduct); and (iv) the burden and standard of proof you would assign. If you think this belongs in a bifurcated proceeding or requires a special verdict form, specify that language as well. Keep it tight enough to guide jurors and to survive appellate review.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally sound: the law should not accept any single test or marker as dispositive of momentary volitional failure. Dr. Chen is right that these tools are neither specific nor time‑stamped. If we are to permit a dyscontrol excuse, courts should insist on tight convergence across mechanism, history, and the index event, and reserve it for reactive violence. Here is the judicially workable bundle I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard:

Minimum converging pillars (all required)

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized/unplanned execution; no luring, staging, or concealment.
- Corroboration where possible (video/911/body‑cam; witness descriptions of “blanking out,” tremor, tachycardia; post‑event confusion). If the record shows instrumental behavior before or after, the excuse fails.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of episodic dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation or Intermittent Explosive Disorder–like episodes, ED visits, sleep disruption tied to neighborhood stress. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive evidence of impaired inhibition with validity checks
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop; I would downweight WCST).
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone such as TOMM/MSVT) and stability/cross‑test convergence. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if feasible.
- Low/moderate psychopathic traits (e.g., PCL‑R not in the predatory range), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the event
- Structured diagnostic work by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to pre‑existing exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the index trigger and response. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol profile over the pre‑offense months) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with the mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one biological insult in sensitive periods that plausibly degrades prefrontal control (e.g., childhood blood lead levels ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or any prior ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), plus corroboration that these exposures predate and plausibly contribute to current executive deficits.

Disqualifiers and necessary exclusions
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at the event; strong instrumental motive; malingering (failures on PVTs); or testing performed so late and under such stressed conditions that state effects likely dominate.
- Offense category: confine to reactive interpersonal violence (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime and felony‑murder predicates.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and legal stress depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize test conditions, repeat when feasible, and lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple PVTs and cross‑source consistency; beware “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: do not let toxin‑history (lead, FASD) be conflated with alcohol/stimulant effects at the time.
- Reverse causation: post‑arrest/incarceration can alter cortisol and cognition; hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and pre‑charge documentation help.
- Over‑interpretation of imaging: fMRI/EEG have no individual‑level probative value for momentary control; admit only, if at all, as background science, not attribution.

Procedural safeguards
- Notice and a Daubert/Kumho pretrial hearing keyed to the pillars above; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized proffers (geocoded deprivation history; CPS/school/medical/EPA‑HUD records; UI data).
- Funding parity for indigent defendants to avoid a doctrine available only to the well‑resourced.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions: jurors should be told this is not a general “bad background” defense; the question is whether, due to specified factors, defendant’s inhibitory control was so substantially degraded at the time that he could not reasonably have refrained. Mere difficulty, anger, or cultural norms do not suffice.

Disposition
- If the narrow automatism/dyscontrol excuse is found, favor ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation from criminogenic settings, nutrition/sleep stabilization, employment pipelines), with civil commitment only if the defendant is mentally ill and dangerous. Where the showing is substantial but short of excuse, MPC‑style EED should mitigate homicide; otherwise, RSB belongs at sentencing with verified deprivation indicators.

Bottom line
Neither Stroop curves nor cortisol slopes can, alone, carry the day. A five‑part convergence—event‑level reactivity, pre‑offense dyscontrol, validated inhibition deficits, a diagnosis mapping to the event, and an objective developmental insult—plus rigorous exclusion of alternatives, is the administrable path that respects Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit, protects victims, and prevents floodgates.

Judge Ellery, wearing your Daubert/Kumho hat, are Dr. Chen’s “five‑pillars” bundle and the specific tools she and Prof. Santiago propose (SSRT/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade/affective tasks, hair cortisol, historic BLLs) sufficiently reliable and fitting to the dyscontrol question to reach the jury? Which instruments would you admit, sharply limit, or exclude (e.g., WCST, PCL‑R), and what concrete gatekeeping steps and limiting instructions would you impose to prevent junk science, undue prejudice, and resource inequity? Please be specific about admissibility criteria for each measure, the structure of the pretrial hearing, and any pattern jury instructions you’d give on how to weigh this evidence.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

The science here is probative but not time‑stamped. None of the proposed instruments (SSRT/Go–No‑Go, Stroop, WCST, cortisol, historic BLLs) can by itself locate a loss of volitional control at the precise moment. Used in combination, and anchored to the event record and pre‑offense documentation, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing showing in a narrow band of reactive‑violence cases. The institutional task is to specify a bundle, keep experts in their lane, and police state–trait and post‑hoc errors.

On specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (SSRT) is the closest fit to inhibitory control; Stroop is supportive; WCST is least specific to inhibition. All are susceptible to state effects (sleep, meds, anxiety) and effort.
- Stress/exposure markers: Hair/diurnal cortisol reflects chronic load, not the instant; childhood BLLs and other developmental insults increase plausibility of prefrontal dyscontrol but are historical, not momentary. These are mechanism builders, not clocks.
- Bottom line: No single assay can prove “no fair opportunity to conform” at t0; the law should demand convergent proof that (i) the offense bore the signature of reactive dyscontrol, (ii) the defendant had pre‑existing inhibitory deficits plausibly traceable to verified exposures, and (iii) no better proximate explanation fits the facts.

Minimum bundle for a clear‑and‑convincing showing
I would require all of the following, with a Daubert/Kumho pretrial hearing and neutral, court‑appointed experts:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; chaotic execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous reports (911/body‑cam/witnesses) of “seeing red,” blanking, marked autonomic arousal. Any appreciable planning or instrumental motive should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Non‑forensic, pre‑charge records evidencing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (school discipline/IEPs, pediatric/ED visits, juvenile mental health notes), plus corroborated sleep disruption or affective lability. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity safeguards
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks germane to the mechanism (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence, and intact effort indices (embedded PVTs and stand‑alone measures). Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting). Low–moderate psychopathy scores consistent with impulsive rather than predatory aggression may be considered.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD with dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to the documented exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the index trigger/response. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Independent proof of at least one material biological insult in sensitive periods (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to present executive deficits.

And all of the following exclusions/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as the proximate driver should defeat the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must demonstrate baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple validity checks, collateral informants, consistency across sessions; “too bad to be true” patterns or selective failures weigh heavily against admissibility/weight.
- Alternative diagnoses: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time, and clear instrumental motives (retaliation for gain, gang directives).
- Timing/artifact controls: testing as early as feasible (30–60 days) and reliance on pre‑offense records to avoid incarceration‑induced changes being misread as premorbid traits.

Judicial guardrails and evidentiary management
- Gatekeeping: Formal Rule 702/Daubert hearing; require the defense to tie each proffer to an articulated element of the doctrine (mechanism, temporality, exclusion).
- Neutral expertise: Court‑appointed neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental‑health experts to reduce partisanship; standardized proffer templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA, unemployment records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Offense limitation: Confine the excuse to genuinely reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden/standard: Clear and convincing evidence that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that such degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Jury instructions: Focused “fair opportunity to conform” language; caution that brain/biological evidence is supportive but not determinative; no expert testimony on the ultimate legal conclusion.
- Imaging: Functional neuroimaging, if offered, should be admitted, if at all, only as background education with a strong Rule 403 limiting instruction; it lacks individual‑diagnostic specificity for moment‑of‑offense control.

Pitfalls courts should be alert to
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and situational stress depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; consider repeat testing; use actigraphy or collateral sleep logs when feasible.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifacts: Post‑charge incarceration and litigation can alter physiology and test performance. Weight pre‑offense documentation heavily.
- Ecological/reference‑class errors: Do not infer individual causation from neighborhood‑level correlations; require individual exposure proof and within‑person temporality.
- Base‑rate neglect: Many with similar profiles do not offend; the doctrine should demand alignment across all pillars and an offense signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol.
- Racial/class stereotyping: Ensure the narrative does not become a proxy for biased leniency; require objective records and neutral experts; provide funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Double counting/overreach: Keep the excuse narrow; channel borderline cases to sentencing mitigation to preserve proportionality and public legitimacy.

In short, the proposed batteries and markers are useful parts of a convergent case; they are not silver bullets. A tightly specified five‑pillar bundle, plus firm exclusions, gives courts a workable, rule‑governed path to honor Hart’s fairness limit without opening the floodgates or eroding protection for victimized communities.

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s five-pillar bundle as the scientific backbone, are these administrable in court? Concretely, what would your pretrial gate look like (a Daubert-style checklist the judge applies), and what single-paragraph pattern jury instruction would you give on how to weigh Stage‑2 attribution evidence (making clear biomarkers aren’t dispositive, requiring clear‑and‑convincing proof of substantial, reactive dyscontrol at the time of the act)? Please be specific in the language you’d endorse to minimize error costs and expert battles.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen: no single measure in Stage 2 is specific or time‑resolved enough to prove loss of control “at the moment.” But a tightly specified, convergent bundle can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial reactive dyscontrol in a narrow class of cases. The legal task is to translate that science into administrable gates and jury guidance that minimize error and preserve legitimacy.

Are the proposed tools up to the job?
- Neurocognitive tasks. Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (with valid SSRT) and antisaccade are the best direct probes of inhibition; an affective variant (emotional Go–No‑Go/Stroop) is appropriate because many incidents are anger‑triggered. The classic Stroop and WCST are less specific; I would downweight WCST. All testing must include multiple performance‑validity tests and, ideally, cross‑session stability.
- Stress/toxin markers. Historic blood lead levels (during childhood) are probative of developmental insult to prefrontal control; they do not “timestamp” the offense but strengthen plausibility when paired with present inhibitory deficits. Diurnal cortisol is noisy; hair cortisol gives a better chronic window but remains supportive only. I would treat fMRI/EEG as, at most, corroborative and often excludable under Rule 403 if offered as a quasi‑deterministic “smoking gun.”

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)
All five pillars must be met; no single pillar suffices:
1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation after a salient provocation; minimal planning; disorganized execution; contemporaneous evidence (911/body‑cam/witnesses) of “seeing red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal; no luring, weapon staging, or calculated post‑offense concealment.

2) Pre‑offense corroboration of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline notes for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental health records of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, documented chronic sleep disruption). This anchors temporality and guards against post hoc artifacts.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with intact embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity indices and either cross‑session stability or cross‑test convergence. Include a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if feasible. Low/moderate psychopathy scores to support an impulsive (not predatory) profile.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), established by a qualified clinician, with symptom content and triggers plausibly explaining the incident and anchored to pre‑existing exposures. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Independent documentation of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated, or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk) that predates and plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. (Historic toxin exposure ≠ acute substance use.)
- Strong indicators of planning/instrumental motive, or high predatory trait profile.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures (a different doctrine), acute TBI at the event, or malingering (failed PVTs).
- Forensic artifact risks: testing long after the event without pre‑offense corroboration should carry little weight.

Key scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, caffeine, meds, pain, incarceration stress can depress test performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize conditions; prefer pre‑offense documentation; repeat or triangulate where possible.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple PVTs; be wary of selective or “too bad to be true” deficits.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge stress can alter physiology; hair cortisol and, more importantly, pre‑charge records mitigate this.
- Over‑interpretation of neuro “gloss”: fMRI images and single‑day cortisol profiles are high‑prejudice/low‑probative unless tightly tied to the mechanism and corroborated. Apply Daubert/Frye and Rule 403 rigorously.
- Norming bias: ensure neuropsych norms are demographically appropriate; require examiners to address cultural/educational confounds.
- Ecological fallacy: neighborhood statistics prove exposure risk, not individual impairment; Stage 2 must stand on individual evidence.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing under Rule 104(a) with a structured proffer keyed to the five pillars; burden on the defense, clear and convincing.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to review methods, validity, and alternative causes.
- Standardized documentary proffers (health department BLLs, CPS/school/housing/UI records; geocoded residency histories).
- Offense domain: confine to reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Special verdict interrogatories: require the jury to answer (i) whether inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) whether that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Cautionary instruction: this is an excuse, not a justification; it does not ratify the act or diminish victims’ harm; it applies only if fair opportunity to comply was substantially absent at the time.
- Bifurcation: if the gate is not met, RSB evidence should be channeled to sentencing mitigation, not guilt.

Model instruction (core idea)
“The defendant claims that, due to developmental exposures and chronic adversity, his ability to inhibit a sudden, provoked impulse was substantially impaired at the time of the offense. To accept this excuse, you must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (1) the offense arose from a sudden provocation and was not planned; (2) the defendant’s inhibitory control was substantially degraded, as shown by reliable testing and pre‑offense records; and (3) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of his act. If voluntary intoxication was the proximate cause, or if the act was planned or instrumental, you must reject the defense.”

Disposition
Where the excuse is found, I favor ESB‑oriented, court‑supervised conditions (housing/sleep/nutrition support, trauma‑focused therapy, removal from criminogenic contexts, employment pipelines), with civil commitment available where statutory criteria are met. That preserves victim protection and public confidence without sliding into RSB‑as‑justification.

Bottom line
With these gates and safeguards, Stage 2 can do useful work. The convergence demanded here—event signature, pre‑offense corroboration, valid inhibitory deficits, diagnostic linkage, and an objective developmental insult, plus exclusion of alternatives—will keep this a rare excuse, focused on the small subset where Hart’s fairness limit is truly engaged.

Building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle, from an administrability standpoint could you draft concrete, trial‑ready jury instructions and a special verdict form for a dyscontrol (RSB) excuse? Please specify: (i) the elements the defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence; (ii) explicit exclusions (e.g., planned/instrumental crimes, substantial voluntary intoxication); (iii) guidance on weighing pre‑offense records versus post‑charge testing; and (iv) how the verdict should interact with lesser‑included offenses and ESB‑style dispositions. Keep it concise but operational—language a trial judge could actually read.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions. If courts are to admit dyscontrol evidence without losing the jury or the docket, we need a tight, pre‑specified bundle, robust Daubert screening, and narrow offense coverage (reactive violence). My concrete view:

1) What the science can and cannot do
- No single test time‑stamps loss of control. These tools are probative only in convergence with event‑level facts and pre‑offense documentation.
- Treat classic executive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go; antisaccade; affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop) as the core; WCST is low‑specificity and should be down‑weighted.
- Biomarkers (childhood BLLs; hair/diurnal cortisol; ferritin/IDA) are supportive of mechanism and temporality, not dispositive. Brain imaging (fMRI) is high‑prejudice/low‑incremental value and should be disfavored.

2) Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold
Require all of the following; failure on any prong defeats the excuse:

A. Event signature (reactive)
- Near‑immediate escalation to violence after a salient provocation; no luring/staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam or multiple witnesses) of “went blank/ saw red,” marked autonomic arousal. Any substantial planning/cover‑up presumptively defeats the claim.

B. Pre‑offense documentary trail
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol: school discipline/IEPs, juvenile or ED notes of dissociation/IED‑type episodes, chronic sleep disruption tied to neighborhood stressors. This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation.

C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go SSRT; antisaccade; affective inhibition task), plus a measure of impulsive choice (e.g., delay discounting), with intact effort/performance‑validity indices (embedded and stand‑alone) and stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Trait profile inconsistent with predation (e.g., PCL‑R not in the moderate‑high psychopathic range).

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to Stage‑1 exposures; symptom triggers plausibly explain the index assault. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) are helpful but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult
- At least one independently documented biological exposure during sensitive periods (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

F. Exclusions
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (involuntary intoxication is different); no primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; no acute TBI at the offense; no credible instrumental motive; no malingering (multiple PVTs).

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing (sleep/caffeine/meds), prefer early testing plus pre‑offense records; repeat or triangulate.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress flattens cortisol and depresses performance; hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and historic labs mitigate.
- Coaching/malingering: require multiple validity measures and collateral informants.
- Biomarker overreach: exclude “brain pictures” unless they materially add beyond behavioral/neuropsych evidence; strong Rule 403 presumption against fMRI.

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability and fairness)
- Mandatory pretrial Daubert hearing tied to a structured checklist (the bundle above); defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden on each prong.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Bifurcation: guilt first; if the jury finds the elements, proceed to an excuse phase with specialized instructions clarifying this is an excuse, not a justification.
- Special verdict interrogatories (e.g., reactive event; substantial degradation of inhibitory control; substantial causal contribution of RSB exposures; exclusion of intoxication).

5) Scope limits and dispositions
- Limit to reactive violent offenses (and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- If excused, channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under supervision; civil commitment only where dangerousness and mental disease criteria are met.
- In close cases falling short of the bundle, steer to MPC‑style EED (homicide) or structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators.

Bottom line: With this minimum bundle and these guardrails, the doctrine remains narrow, morally principled (Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit), and institutionally governable.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage screen and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as the scientific substrate, make this administrable: What precise pretrial gatekeeping order would you issue under Daubert to decide whether an RSB‑dyscontrol excuse may go to the jury? Please give a concise checklist of required showings and disqualifiers, specify the burden/standard, and delineate the limited offense domain you’d allow. Keep it to one page of concrete criteria.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m largely in step with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions. For courts, the question isn’t whether any one assay “shows” loss of control at T‑0; none does. The question is whether a convergence of pre‑offense exposures and impairments, plus the event signature, makes it highly probable that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act. That can be made administrable with a narrow offense domain, a clear‑and‑convincing burden, and rigid gatekeeping.

1) Offense domain and doctrinal channel
- Limit at guilt to reactive interpersonal violence. Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes (robbery, burglary), organized retaliation, and situations with evident staging or concealment.
- Channel through existing doctrines:
  - Involuntary‑rage automatism (complete excuse) for truly reflexive, short‑fuse violence.
  - MPC‑style Extreme Emotional Disturbance (partial mitigation) in homicide when the dyscontrol is substantial but not automatistic.
  - All other offenses: RSB is for sentencing mitigation only.

2) Burden and procedure
- Defense bears clear‑and‑convincing evidence.
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health (with funding parity for indigent defendants).
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD orders, unemployment records; geocoded exposure histories).

3) Minimum converging bundle to meet Stage 2 (attribution) under a clear‑and‑convincing standard
No single item suffices; require all five pillars, plus disqualifier screens.

A. Event signature (must have)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of planning/cover‑up. Contemporaneous corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam, witness descriptions of “went blank,” marked autonomic arousal). Any luring, weapon staging, or calculated post‑event behavior should presumptively defeat the excuse.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (must have)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control: school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED; prior ED visits for rage episodes; documented chronic sleep disruption. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity (must have)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks most tied to the mechanism (e.g., Stop‑Signal or Go/No‑Go with valid SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/affective Stroop). Include delay discounting as supportive.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) intact; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Low to moderate psychopathy/antagonism traits (e.g., PCL‑R not in high range), consistent with impulsive rather than predatory aggression.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event (must have)
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD with dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with triggers and symptomatology plausibly explaining the instant event.
- Biological stress markers may be admitted as supportive only: hair cortisol reflecting pre‑offense months; low resting HF‑HRV. Treat as corroborative, not determinative.

E. Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism (must have one)
- Childhood blood‑lead history ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated, or a prior ≥10) during sensitive periods; or documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; or well‑documented prenatal alcohol/drug exposure (FASD risk); or verified chronic sleep disruption tied to environmental factors (crowding/policing) corroborated by records.
- These should predate and plausibly contribute to current executive deficits.

Disqualifiers/controls (all must be satisfied)
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as the proximate driver defeat the excuse. If substances were present, defendant must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering: multiple PVTs, cross‑source consistency (collateral informants, records). Be alert to “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” or selective impairment patterns.
- Alternative primary causes: rule out frank psychosis/mania not tied to RSB exposures, acute TBI at the time, or clear instrumental motives.
- Timing and state–trait control: conduct testing as early as feasible, standardize for sleep/meds/caffeine, and, where possible, repeat. Heavily weight pre‑offense records to avoid forensic artifacts.

4) Tests and biomarkers: admissibility guidance
- Admit SSRT/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, and affective interference tasks as core; Stroop and WCST are secondary and should be down‑weighted.
- fMRI/EEG: generally exclude as outcome‑determinative; allow only as educational context if Daubert factors are not met. Hair cortisol and HRV are supportive, not specific.
- Ensure culturally appropriate norms and language adjustments to avoid measurement bias.

5) Jury management and instructions
- Bifurcate when practicable: guilt first; if the automatism/EED issue is reached, use specialized instructions focusing jurors on volitional capacity at the time—not on broad social condemnation or sympathy.
- Use special verdict forms with interrogatories on each pillar (event signature, pre‑offense dyscontrol, neurocognitive deficits/validity, diagnosis mapping, exposure biomarker, disqualifiers). This aids appellate review and regularizes application.

6) Disposition if excuse/mitigation is found
- Automatism: NG by reason of involuntariness; immediate risk assessment. If dangerousness persists, use civil commitment where mental disease criteria are met; otherwise, ESB‑oriented, court‑supervised conditions (housing relocation, trauma‑focused therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines). Victim input should be formally solicited.
- EED in homicide: reduce to manslaughter with ESB‑conditioned probation or blended custodial/community terms as warranted.
- Sentencing‑only cases: adopt a structured mitigation grid keyed to verified deprivation indicators (e.g., cumulative ADI exposure, childhood BLLs, CPS‑substantiated adversity), with caps to preserve proportionality.

7) Pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, and legal anxiety can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer pre‑offense documentation.
- Reverse causation and base‑rate neglect: don’t infer cause from mere co‑occurrence; require temporality and dose–response logic.
- Cultural/linguistic testing bias: ensure appropriate norms and qualified bilingual examiners where needed.
- Equality and optics: without neutral experts and defense funding parity, this will apply unevenly and lose legitimacy.

Bottom line: With these guardrails, the dyscontrol inquiry can be made narrow and rule‑governed. Most violent cases will not clear this gate; those that do will be the top tail where Hart’s fairness limit is truly implicated. That preserves public protection and victim respect while giving principled relief in the small set where opportunity to comply was not fairly available.

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as givens, what administrable gatekeeping architecture would you endorse to keep the doctrine tight? Specifically: (i) outline a pretrial hearing structure (burden, Daubert factors, neutral experts, and disqualifiers like voluntary intoxication) that a trial court could implement without turning the case into a science seminar; and (ii) propose concise model jury instruction language defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and confining the excuse to reactive violence. Please be concrete about what you’d codify in a rule versus leave to case law, so trial judges and counsel have a clear roadmap.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Short answer from the bench: none of these measures time‑stamps loss of control. They can corroborate, not carry, the moment-of-offense inference. If we are to admit a dyscontrol excuse without blowing the doors off, event‑level proof must be the anchor; neurocognitive and biomarker evidence are secondary, corroborative layers. I would structure Stage 2 accordingly.

1) Specificity and temporality of the proposed tools
- Neurocognitive batteries (stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) index trait‑like inhibitory control; they are not temporally precise. Useful if (a) deficits are moderate to large, (b) performance validity is sound, and (c) there is pre‑offense documentation of similar dyscontrol. WCST is too nonspecific; I would downweight or exclude it for this purpose.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) reflect chronic load; historic blood lead levels (BLLs) and documented early malnutrition/iron deficiency are developmental risk markers. All are supportive, not determinative, and none speaks to the precise moment.
- fMRI/EEG: high risk of undue prejudice with modest probative increment; absent exceptional circumstances, I would exclude under Rule 403/Daubert as “nice to have” science with outsized juror impact.

2) Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold
Require convergence on all of the following, with no single element sufficient:

A. Event anchor (must have)
- Objective indicia that the offense was reactive/affective, not instrumental: near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/staging/cover‑up; contemporaneous witness/body‑cam/911 descriptions of “snapped,” “saw red,” dissociation, autonomic arousal. If there is evidence of planning or concealment, the defense should presumptively fail.

B. Pre‑offense history (must have)
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive behavior, ED notes, juvenile mental‑health entries), or documented sleep disruption tied to neighborhood conditions. This addresses temporality and guards against reverse causation.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity (must have)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), plus intact performance‑validity testing. Where feasible, replicate or triangulate to mitigate state noise. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy traits to support an impulsive, not predatory, profile.

D. Clinical linkage (must have)
- A qualified‑clinician diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) with symptom content and trigger mapping plausibly onto the index event, anchored in exposures documented before the offense (not litigation‑created). Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) may corroborate but are not required.

E. Objective developmental insult (should have; strong weight if present)
- Independently documented early‑life insult consistent with impaired prefrontal control (e.g., BLLs ≥5 µg/dL in childhood—ideally repeated, or ≥10 once; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk). Treat as mechanism‑plausibility support.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one defeats the excuse)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication proximate to the act (alcohol/stimulants) as the principal driver.
- Clear instrumental motive or planning (weapon staging, luring, concealment).
- Primary psychosis/mania not credibly tied to RSB exposures.
- Malingering: failed performance‑validity testing; “too bad to be true” scatter; inconsistency across sessions; coached symptom profiles.

3) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, or custodial stress can depress test performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; rely heavily on pre‑offense records; consider repeating testing.
- Reverse causation and “forensic artifacts”: weight nonforensic, pre‑charge documentation more than post‑charge assessments; be wary of records generated solely for litigation.
- Ecological fallacy: high‑deprivation neighborhoods cannot substitute for individual‑level proof; Stage 1 context must not be allowed to “do the work” of Stage 2 causation.
- Hired‑gun bias/over‑interpretation: require court‑appointed neutral experts; limit experts to explaining what the measures do and do not show; prohibit conclusory “he had no control” opinions.

4) Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing with structured proffer keyed to the elements above; appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and standardized evidentiary templates (certified lab BLLs, CPS/school/housing/EPA records, geocoded exposure histories).
- Limit offense domain to reactive violence (and rare, truly impulsive nonviolent offenses); exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Burden: clear and convincing evidence that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.
- Jury management: bifurcate; give specialized instructions; consider special interrogatories (reactive vs. instrumental; substantial impairment; substantial causal contribution).

5) Disposition
If the defense is found, I would not default to release. Order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions (removal from criminogenic context, trauma‑focused therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, structured employment/education), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. This respects Hart’s fairness limit while addressing victim‑protection and public‑legitimacy concerns.

Bottom line: treat event phenomenology as the primary proof, require pre‑offense documentation, and use neurocognitive/biological evidence as corroboration under tight validity and gatekeeping. With those constraints, Stage 2 can be administrable and morally defensible; without them, we risk converting background into blanket excuse.

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions as givens, how would you translate this into a workable courtroom rule? Specifically: what precise pretrial admissibility standard (elements and burden) would you adopt for an RSB‑dyscontrol excuse to avoid mini‑trials and floodgates, and what exact pattern jury instruction would you give on “substantial degradation of inhibitory control,” causation to the instant act, and disqualifiers (planning, voluntary intoxication)? Please be concrete with proposed rule text and instruction language.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 moves the inquiry where it must go—away from population averages and toward an event-level showing that this defendant’s inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of the offense. The tools she proposes can help, but none is specific or time‑stamped enough to carry the day alone. As a court, the only way to keep this administrable and legitimate is to insist on a tight, pre‑specified bundle and to weight the evidence in the right order.

1) Weight of the categories
- Event signature comes first. Juries and judges understand immediacy, disorganization, and lack of instrumental purpose. If the record shows staging, luring, or concealment, the dyscontrol excuse should presumptively fail regardless of test scores.
- Pre‑offense documentation comes second. Nonforensic records of stimulus‑bound outbursts, school/juvenile notes, ED visits for rage, and long‑standing sleep disruption establish temporality and reduce “litigation artifact” risk.
- Neurocognitive and physiological testing is supportive, not dispositive. Inhibition tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No–Go; antisaccade; affective variants) with validity checks can corroborate a mechanism; Stroop and WCST add little specificity and should be down‑weighted. Hair cortisol and historic blood‑lead levels bolster plausibility but are not moment‑of‑offense indices. I would bar fMRI as anything more than a background education tool; it should never be a linchpin.
- Diagnostic linkage helps if anchored in pre‑existing records (PTSD—dissociative subtype; IED), and if the symptom content plausibly maps onto the event. Trait psychopathy measures may help exclude predatory profiles but must be used cautiously.

2) Minimum bundle to satisfy clear and convincing
Require all of the following, with defense bearing the burden:

A. Event-level proof of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation upon salient provocation; disorganized, non‑instrumental conduct; contemporaneous descriptions of “went blank/saw red,” marked autonomic arousal; ideally corroborated by video/911/body‑cam. Any evidence of planning, weapon staging, or post‑event concealment defeats this prong.

B. Pre‑offense history of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline, juvenile MH notes, prior ED visits), and, where possible, documentation of chronic sleep disturbance.

C. Neurocognitive corroboration with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No–Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and either test–retest stability or cross‑task convergence. Include a choice‑impulsivity measure (delay discounting) where available.

D. Plausible clinical/physiological linkage
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (PTSD—dissociative subtype or IED) anchored to exposures, plus at least one objective exposure biomarker consistent with a developmental mechanism (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a prior ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk). Chronic stress markers (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) are supportive but not required.

E. Exclusions
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (presence of alcohol/stimulants should presumptively defeat the excuse unless the defense proves baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication).
- No primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; no acute TBI at offense; no strong instrumental motive.
- Malingering controls met (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; cross‑informant consistency).
- Trait profile not consistent with predatory aggression (cautious use of PCL‑R/analogues).

3) Scientific pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress, and testing context can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions, prefer hair over single‑day salivary cortisol, and anchor with pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Require multiple validity indices and look for “selective” or “too bad” patterns. Repeat testing or cross‑battery convergence helps.
- Reverse causation/post‑hoc fallacies: Do not infer from post‑offense deficits alone; temporality must be shown by earlier records or developmental biomarkers.
- Over‑interpretation of generic deficits: WCST and classic Stroop are nonspecific; fMRI is not a lie detector; psychophysiology is supportive at best.
- Acute intoxication: Keep the line bright—voluntary intoxication generally defeats the excuse.
- Base‑rate neglect and disparity risk: These measures have nontrivial false‑positive rates; courts must ensure indigent defendants can access neutral experts or the doctrine will skew by resources.

4) Process safeguards
- Daubert‑style pretrial hearing keyed to a structured checklist; defense proffer must satisfy each element above before the jury hears it.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; require disclosure of raw data and scoring algorithms; set testing windows (ideally within 30–60 days) and protocols.
- Limit offense domain to genuinely reactive violence (and rare, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Use bifurcation and tailored instructions: make plain that these findings bear only on volitional control at the moment, not on general character, and that sympathy or social critique is not a substitute for the elements.

Bottom line: With this sequencing and bundle, Santiago’s Stage 2 can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a small, identifiable slice of cases. It remains consistent with Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply—while keeping faith with administrability and public legitimacy.

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage architecture and with Dr. Chen’s cautions. For courts, the center of gravity in Stage 2 must be the event itself—what happened, how quickly, how disorganized—corroborated by pre‑offense records. Neurocognitive and biomarker data can corroborate mechanism and chronic vulnerability; they cannot, standing alone, time‑stamp a loss of control. That has to be reflected in the offense signature.

Where I would land, consistent with a narrow, rule‑governed avenue, is this:

1) Offense‑eligibility and burden
- Limit the excuse to truly reactive, affective violence (seconds to minutes after a salient trigger), not acquisitive or planned crimes. In borderline homicide cases that don’t clear this bar, channel to MPC §210.3 EED mitigation rather than full excuse.
- Defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden on two linked propositions: (i) at the time of the act, inhibitory control was substantially degraded such that the conduct was not the product of a meaningful exercise of choice (an automatism/dissociative‑like state); and (ii) that degradation was substantially caused by the long‑term exposures shown at Stage 1.

2) Minimum converging bundle for Stage 2 (no single element suffices)
A. Event signature (must have)
- Acute provocation; rapid escalation; no luring or preparation; disorganized execution; contemporaneous corroboration (video/bodycam/911 audio/witnesses) of “blanking out,” “seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal; immediate post‑event confusion. Any substantial planning/cover‑up defeats the excuse.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (must have)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile or ED notes, prior documented rage episodes, sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity (must have)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks directly tied to the mechanism (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go SSRT, antisaccade; add an affective variant like emotional Stroop/Go–No‑Go), with intact multiple performance‑validity indicators and consistency across sessions. Downweight WCST; it is not specific to inhibition.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive rather than predatory aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R or equivalent), used cautiously.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage (must have)
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptoms plausibly map onto the index event’s trigger and phenomenology, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult (must have at least one)
- Independent records of a biologically plausible insult during sensitive windows (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; FASD risk; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition), which increase the plausibility that current inhibitory deficits have a developmental root consistent with the measured neurocognitive profile.

F. Exclusion/controls (all must be satisfied)
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; if substances were present, credible showing that baseline dyscontrol existed independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless a different doctrine applies), acute TBI at the time, malingering (multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests), and strong instrumental motives.

3) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, and custodial stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; seek pre‑charge records; consider repeat testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require performance‑validity testing; be alert to “too bad to be true” profiles and selective impairments.
- Acute intoxication: alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication should presumptively defeat the excuse.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense incarceration can alter biomarkers; hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and historical labs (e.g., BLLs) help.
- Over‑interpretation: fMRI and similar tools should be treated as, at most, supportive; do not let imaging become a talisman.

4) Procedural gatekeeping to keep the doctrine governable
- Notice and pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing tied to a standardized proffer. Use court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; cap partisans.
- Require documentary anchors for Stage 1 (CPS, school, medical, housing/EPA, UI, geocoded neighborhood indices). No litigation‑generated histories alone.
- Federal Rule of Evidence 403 balancing: exclude lengthy sociological digressions that don’t bear on the elements; keep the jury’s focus on the linkage to the instant offense.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will operate as a class privilege and damage legitimacy.

5) Model jury instruction (responsibility phase)
“You may find the defendant not responsible by reason of involuntary dyscontrol only if the defendant has proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (1) at the time of the act, he/she experienced an acute state of involuntary dyscontrol—comparable to automatism or dissociation—such that the conduct was not the product of a meaningful ability to inhibit or choose; and (2) this state was substantially caused by long‑standing, documented environmental deprivations and biological insults. In deciding this, you may consider the immediacy and character of the event, pre‑offense records of stimulus‑bound loss of control, validated tests of inhibitory function, clinical diagnosis mapping to the event, and objective developmental exposures. Voluntary intoxication or evidence of planning defeats the defense.”

6) Disposition
- Special verdict. If the defense succeeds, order noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision (housing relocation from criminogenic environments, trauma‑focused therapy, nutrition/sleep support, employment services). If the person remains demonstrably dangerous and has a qualifying mental disorder, consider civil commitment under existing standards with periodic review.

Bottom line. Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 list, tightened as above and viewed through Dr. Chen’s “no single test can time‑stamp control failure” lens, can support a narrow excuse in the small subset of reactive violent cases where mechanism, history, and moment align. Most cases with serious adversity but without a true automatism/dissociative‑like episode should be handled through MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators. That bifurcation preserves fairness to defendants who lacked a fair opportunity to comply, protects victims and public safety, and keeps the law administrable and legitimate.

From an administrability vantage point, how would you translate Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle into a tight jury instruction that jurors can actually apply? Please sketch concise instruction language defining: (i) the defense’s elements ("substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time of the offense"), (ii) the evidentiary predicates that must converge (history, neurocognitive findings with validity, event‑signature, exposure biomarker), and (iii) categorical exclusions (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication, instrumental planning). Also note whether you would require court‑appointed neutral experts at the Daubert gate and bifurcation to avoid prejudice.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s caution: no single assay can “time‑stamp” loss of control. If we are to admit a dyscontrol excuse at guilt without losing the plot, Stage 2 must be tighter than ordinary mitigation, and it must look very much like a narrow, involuntary‑rage automatism in fact. Here is what, as a judge, I would require to reach clear and convincing evidence on proximate volitional impairment, and how I’d police the science.

Minimum converging bundle (all five required; any one missing, the motion fails)
1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation to violence after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (preferred): 911/body‑cam/video, witness descriptions of “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal; brief post‑event confusion/amnesia may support but is not sufficient.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of episodic dyscontrol
- School/juvenile/ED/clinic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound explosions, dissociation, or IED‑like episodes; sleep disruption records helpful. This addresses temporality and guards against “built for trial” profiles.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact multiple performance‑validity tests and either re‑test stability or cross‑test convergence.
- Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy/antisocial trait scores (to favor impulsive over predatory aggression).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored in pre‑existing exposures and with triggers/symptoms plausibly explaining the index act. Chronic stress physiology (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) is supportive, not dispositive.

5) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- Independently documented developmental insult (any one): childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (repeated or one ≥10), documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive periods, or credible FASD risk—plus a plausible link to current executive deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, defendant must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, malingering (multiple PVTs, collateral checks), and clear instrumental motives.
- Testing as early as feasible post‑offense (ideally ≤60–90 days) and reliance on pre‑charge records to blunt reverse‑causation from jail stress.

Scientific pitfalls for courts (and how to manage them)
- State–trait confounds: Sleep deprivation, meds, acute stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing; consider actigraphy/sleep logs; prefer replication or cross‑source corroboration.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity indices; be wary of selective, “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” deficits.
- Neuro‑dazzle: fMRI/EEG adds little to moment‑of‑offense attribution; admit, if at all, only as background consistency, never as a linchpin.
- Base‑rate neglect: Executive deficits are common in forensic samples; require the full bundle and event‑level fit, not “risk factors” alone.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsych, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and standardized documentation (geocoded exposure history; pediatric/CPS/school/EPA–HUD/UI records).
- Limit the domain: reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts). Planned acquisitive crime is presumptively out.
- Burden: clear and convincing on (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) substantial contribution to the instant act.

Jury instruction (to preserve focus and legitimacy)
- Treat as a narrow automatism/dyscontrol excuse: the jury may acquit only if it finds that, due to the documented conditions, the defendant experienced a transient loss or substantial failure of inhibitory control at the time of the act such that he could not have refrained. Exposure, disadvantage, or trait‑level impulsivity alone is not enough.

Disposition
- If established, route to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions under supervision; reserve civil commitment for those demonstrably dangerous and mentally ill. Otherwise, channel RSB evidence to sentencing mitigation with verified indicators.

Bottom line
Santiago’s Stage 2 list is directionally right; Chen is right about the limits. Courts should demand alignment across mechanism (objective developmental insult + neurocognitive deficits), history (pre‑offense dyscontrol), and moment (reactive, disorganized episode), with rigorous exclusion of intoxication, malingering, and instrumental conduct. With those guardrails, we keep the gate narrow—consistent with Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit—and avoid converting a morally attractive insight into an unbounded excuse.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution bundle as a working draft, how would you translate this into a pretrial screening order and jury instructions that keep the doctrine tight and error costs low? Please be concrete on: (a) which offense types are eligible (e.g., reactive violent crimes only?); (b) categorical disqualifiers (planned/instrumental conduct, substantial voluntary intoxication, high psychopathy, etc.); (c) burden and standard of proof; (d) required expert domains and whether to mandate court‑appointed neutrals; and (e) the precise phrasing of the “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense” element so it anchors in fair‑opportunity language without inviting jury‑level determinism. Would you bifurcate guilt/excuse to preserve jury focus, and if so, what comes in at each phase?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 moves the inquiry to the right place: from background correlation to whether this defendant’s inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time of the offense. As a matter of evidence law and administrability, I would say:

- No single lab value or test proves momentary loss of control. These instruments are, at best, trait‑leaning proxies with state noise. They can support, not replace, a factfinder’s assessment of the event itself.
- Properly cabined and triangulated, the bundle can clear a clear‑and‑convincing bar in a narrow band of reactive violence cases.

What I would require as a minimum converging bundle (all of the following), with the defense bearing a clear‑and‑convincing burden and the judge screening at a Daubert‑style hearing:

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Close temporal coupling to a salient provocation; seconds/minutes, not hours.
- Disorganized execution; no luring, staging, concealment, or instrumental post‑event conduct.
- Contemporaneous observations (witness, body‑cam/911 audio) of dissociation/“seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal; any claimed amnesia must be corroborated and cannot carry the day by itself.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound loss of control
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school discipline/IEPs for explosive episodes, juvenile mental‑health notes, ED visits for rage or dissociation, sleep disruption corroborated by attendance or truancy patterns). This addresses temporality and cuts against reverse‑causation and litigation‑molding.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity safeguards
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD impaired (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time on Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go; antisaccade; an affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), obtained under standardized conditions within ~60–90 days, with intact multiple performance‑validity indices and either replication or cross‑test convergence.
- Set‑shifting (WCST) is of limited probative value for inhibition; I would downweight it. Delay discounting can be supportive.
- Trait measures to exclude predatory style (use with caution): low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits; do not overread PCL‑R.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured, clinician‑established diagnosis in the trauma/impulse spectrum (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to pre‑offense exposures, with symptom content that plausibly explains the trigger and the reaction in this incident. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is useful but not mandatory.

5) Objective exposure/biological insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one developmental insult known to degrade executive control (e.g., childhood blood lead levels ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or any ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), ideally with a dose–response link to the measured executive deficits.

And all of the following exclusions/controls:

- Voluntary intoxication: substantial alcohol/drug intoxication at the time is a disqualifier for an excuse (absent recognized involuntary intoxication). If substances were present, the defense must show comparable baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; otherwise the claim fails.
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; consistency across sessions; collateral informants. Courts should be wary of selective “too bad to be true” patterns.
- State–trait confounds: standardize sleep/medication/caffeine before testing; consider repeating or corroborating; give heavier weight to pre‑offense records than post‑charge testing.
- Alternative primary causes: rule out frank psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, or obvious instrumental motives.
- Timing: the closer the testing to the offense (while still standardized) and the richer the pre‑offense trail, the stronger the inference. Late, one‑off, defense‑commissioned testing deserves caution.

On the proposed tools’ specificity/temporality

- Stop‑signal and antisaccade are the most on‑point for motor inhibition; still, they are not time‑stamps of the offense.
- Classic Stroop/WCST are nonspecific; if used, they should be in a secondary, corroborative role.
- Affective variants (emotional Go‑No‑Go/affective Stroop) better approximate the hot‑cognition conditions under which these assaults occur.
- Hair cortisol offers a 2–3 month window of chronic load; single‑day salivary curves are noisy. Historic BLLs are probative of developmental insult, not of the moment.
- fMRI/EEG should be treated, at most, as background mechanism evidence; they do not answer the legal question and risk “brain overclaim” prejudice. Rule 403 warrants a very light judicial hand on such exhibits.

Legal guardrails I would add

- Offense domain: confine this excuse to reactive violent offenses (and perhaps a very narrow slice of truly impulsive nonviolent acts). Planned acquisitive crimes should be presumptively out.
- Causation standard: require that the proven dyscontrol was a substantial contributing factor in the act; not mere presence of adversity or trait impulsivity.
- Neutral experts and parity: court‑appointed neuropsych/psychiatry/environmental‑health experts; resource indigent defendants to avoid a doctrine that only exists for the well‑funded.
- Jury instruction: emphasize that cumulative deprivation alone does not excuse; the question is whether, at the time of the offense, defendant’s capacity to inhibit an otherwise unlawful impulse was substantially degraded, and that ordinary anger, bad character, or voluntary intoxication do not qualify.

Pitfalls for courts to watch

- Base‑rate and ecological fallacies: high adversity prevalence does not mean most cases involve dyscontrol; insist on individualized, pre‑offense corroboration.
- Reverse causation: incarceration and litigation stress can flatten cortisol and depress test performance; pre‑charge records are the antidote.
- Culture shopping/essentialism: the doctrine is about impaired control, not about belonging to a subculture; keep the proof mechanistic, not folkloric.
- Expressive harms: when excluding the excuse (or accepting it), give reasoned rulings to preserve victim confidence and public legitimacy.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 list, pruned and aligned as above, is a workable evidentiary scaffold. Dr. Chen is right to caution that these measures cannot by themselves pinpoint the moment of loss of control. The law’s answer is convergence plus exclusion. If we demand (1) a reactive event signature, (2) a pre‑offense documentary trail of dyscontrol, (3) valid inhibition testing, (4) a clinical map to the episode, and (5) at least one verified developmental insult—while screening out intoxication, malingering, and instrumental crime—we will capture the narrow class Hart had in mind: those who, at the critical moment, lacked a fair opportunity to comply.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s point that no single measure can time‑stamp loss of control, if you were crafting a gatekeeping order, what precise admissibility criteria would you impose (under Daubert/Rule 702 and Rule 403) so only convergent, pre‑offense‑anchored evidence reaches the jury? Please sketch: (a) a brief Daubert checklist for the pretrial ruling (minimum instruments, performance‑validity testing, pre‑offense documentation, toxicology requirements, alternative‑cause exclusions); and (b) a tight model jury instruction that translates that bundle into the legal question—whether inhibitory control was substantially degraded and a substantial contributing cause at the time of the offense. Finally, would you treat voluntary intoxication as a categorical bar or a rebuttable presumption against the excuse?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s architecture and Dr. Chen’s cautions. None of the proposed instruments can time‑stamp volitional failure; the law will have to infer momentary dyscontrol from a converging bundle that links (i) a credible mechanism, (ii) a pre‑offense history, and (iii) an event signature of reactive, not instrumental, violence. To keep this administrable and legitimate, I would require a tight, pretrial proffer and clear‑and‑convincing proof on a minimum bundle, with strong gatekeeping.

1) What the tests can and cannot do
- Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go (SSRT) and antisaccade are the most probative of inhibitory control; Stroop (especially affective variants) is supportive; WCST adds little to the inhibition question and should be downweighted.
- Hair cortisol (chronic load) and historic childhood BLLs (sensitive periods) are mechanistically plausible but not moment‑specific; they are corroborative, not determinative.
- fMRI should not be relied upon for adjudication; at most, it is background science. I would exclude it under 403 in most cases to avoid undue prejudice and pseudo‑precision.

2) Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard
Require all five pillars below; failure on any one defeats the excuse. No single test suffices.

- Pillar A: Event‑level reactive signature
  • Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment. Prefer contemporaneous corroboration (video, 911 audio, bodycam, neutral witnesses). Statements like “went blank/ saw red,” coupled with observed autonomic arousal, help; standing alone, they are weak.

- Pillar B: Pre‑offense, nonforensic history of dyscontrol
  • School/juvenile/medical records predating the offense showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (discipline for explosive reactivity, prior ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption), not manufactured after arrest.

- Pillar C: Neurocognitive deficits with validity
  • At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and either test–retest stability or cross‑task convergence. Include impulsive‑choice (delay discounting) if available. Trait psychopathy measures should not indicate a predatory pattern.

- Pillar D: Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
  • A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented adversities, with symptom content plausibly explaining triggers/dissociation at the offense. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) are supportive but not required.

- Pillar E: Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
  • Independent documentation of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL, ideally repeated or any ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), predating the offense and coherent with the measured deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the defense. A positive tox screen shifts the burden to show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute effects.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the event; strong instrumental motive; and malingering (multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs, consistency across sessions).
- Timing safeguards: complete testing promptly (30–60 days if feasible) and weight pre‑offense records heavily to avoid reverse‑causation artifacts from incarceration stress.

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and litigation stress can depress performance and cortisol; standardize testing conditions, consider actigraphy/collaterals, and use repeat or corroborative testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: insist on validity indices and cross‑source corroboration; beware selective or “too bad to be true” deficits.
- Acute intoxication: don’t let historic toxin exposure be conflated with alcohol/stimulant effects on the day.
- Over‑interpretation: treat all biomarkers as probabilistic; require the full convergence, not a single “smoking gun.”

4) Procedural guardrails
- Daubert‑style pretrial hearing with a structured checklist tied to the pillars; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Offense domain limited to reactive violence (and rare truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Uniform notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs; CPS/school; housing/EPA/HUD; unemployment records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; without it, the doctrine is illusory and inequitable.
- Jury instruction emphasizing that heightened emotion is not enough; the impairment must have substantially degraded the defendant’s capacity to conform to law at the time.

In sum: the proposed batteries and markers, used as part of a five‑pillar convergence, can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of reactive dyscontrol in a small class of cases. The law’s task is to demand that convergence, police the pitfalls, and keep the gate narrow. That preserves Hart’s fairness limit without inviting administrability collapse or disrespect for victims.

You’ve emphasized administrability and error costs. Taking Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as givens, sketch the concrete trial architecture you’d require to keep this governable: (i) what should be decided at a pretrial Daubert‑style hearing versus reserved for the jury; (ii) the exact burden and instruction language you’d give jurors on “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and causation; and (iii) any bright‑line exclusions (e.g., voluntary intoxication, offense types) you would build into the doctrine to avoid expert battles turning into mini‑trials. Please be specific about model instructions and which elements are questions of law vs. fact.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Bottom line. Stage‑2, as Prof. Santiago frames it, points in the right direction provided courts insist on convergence across mechanism, history, and the moment. None of these tools proves “no fair opportunity to comply” by itself; they are, at best, supportive of an inference of reactive dyscontrol. If we are going to let this evidence move a case from correlation to case‑level excuse, the gate must be narrow, the showing clear and convincing, and the offense domain confined to truly reactive violence. Where the bundle falls short, the same materials should be redirected to MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or to structured mitigation at sentencing.

Are the proposed measures specific and temporally sensitive enough? Not alone. Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go, Stroop, WCST and the like assay trait‑level executive control with known state noise; hair/diurnal cortisol index chronic stress with wide variability; historic BLLs tell you about developmental insult, not what happened at 9:17 p.m. These are admissible as part of a convergent case, but they cannot time‑stamp volitional failure. The strongest anchor to “the moment” is the event signature: witnessing and objective records that the act was an unplanned, seconds‑to‑minutes escalation with dissociation‑type features. Everything else should corroborate mechanism and temporality and rule out alternative drivers.

Minimum bundle I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard (all of the following, with no single element sufficient):

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Acute provocation; near‑immediate escalation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions (“blanked out,” “saw red”) or autonomic signs; ideally supported by video/911/bodycam or neutral witnesses.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School, juvenile, medical, or CPS records predating the offense reflecting stimulus‑bound rage, dissociation, or explosive outbursts; sleep disruption tied to environment. This addresses temporality and guards against litigation‑driven manufacture.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity safeguards
- At least two independent measures directly tied to inhibition/affect regulation (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop) ≥1.5 SD below norms, with multiple performance‑validity indices intact and reasonable stability across sessions. WCST may be included but should not carry much weight.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured, clinician‑established diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and response in the instant event. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) may corroborate but are not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL, ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to current inhibitory deficits.

And disqualifiers/controls that, if present, defeat the excuse:
- Evidence of planning, instrumental motive, concealment, or post‑event goal‑directed manipulation.
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause of the act.
- Primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI explaining the conduct (unless the defense proceeds under the separate insanity framework).
- Malingering: failure on multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity measures or “too bad to be true” patterns.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds. Executive tests and cortisol are influenced by acute sleep loss, medications, pain, and incarceration stress. Standardize conditions; prefer pre‑charge records; repeat testing when feasible.
- Malingering/adversarial allegiance. Require multiple validity checks, neutral/court‑appointed experts, and consistency across time and sources.
- Acute intoxication. Alcohol and stimulants degrade inhibition. Voluntary intoxication should generally vitiate a dyscontrol excuse even if an RSB history exists; residual RSB evidence can be heard at sentencing.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact. Post‑offense stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance. Hair cortisol can give a pre‑offense window; the safest antidote is contemporaneous nonforensic documentation (school, pediatric labs, housing/EPA files).
- Over‑interpretation of imaging and omnibus tasks. fMRI/EEG should be treated, at most, as corroborative; Stroop and WCST are nonspecific. Daubert factors—known error rates, peer review, standards—should be applied rigorously.
- Test bias and comprehension. Some tasks have cultural/educational loadings; use appropriate norms and guard against stereotype threat and language effects.

Procedural guardrails to keep the gate tight and the record clean

- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense, confined to reactive violent offenses (with rare exceptions for truly impulsive nonviolent acts); categorical exclusion for planned acquisitive crime.
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tethered to a standardized proffer (checklist mirroring the bundle above); early notice; protective orders for sensitive records.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized testing protocols (including PVTs) administered promptly (ideally within 60–90 days).
- Special verdict interrogatories so juries answer discrete factual questions (reactivity/planning; pre‑offense dyscontrol history; test deficits with validity; developmental insult; intoxication), enhancing transparency and appellate review.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions to limit spillover prejudice and to explain that the excuse turns on fair opportunity to comply at the time of offense, not on background adversity per se.

Fit with doctrine and error costs. Used this way, Stage‑2 attribution should be reserved for the “involuntary‑rage/automatism‑like” end of the spectrum. When the showing is short of substantial loss of control, MPC‑style EED can mitigate murder to manslaughter; otherwise, RSB properly informs sentencing under validated mitigation frameworks. This structure respects Hart’s fairness limit while containing false positives—the error with the greatest legitimacy cost at the guilt phase—and provides a sentencing safety valve for close cases.

Assume we adopted Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five-pillar bundle for a narrow dyscontrol excuse. From an administrability and error-cost perspective, what concrete procedural architecture would you put in place to make this workable in a trial court? Please be specific about (i) a pretrial Rule 702/Daubert-style proffer (what must be attached, timing, neutral experts); (ii) whether to bifurcate and how to structure jury instructions defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “reactive (not instrumental) aggression”; (iii) evidentiary limits (e.g., hair cortisol, fMRI) and handling of voluntary intoxication; and (iv) funding parity to avoid wealth effects. If you can, sketch a short model jury instruction that operationalizes the clear-and-convincing standard and the disqualifiers Dr. Chen noted.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions. None of the Stage 2 tools is, standing alone, either specific or time‑precise enough to prove loss of control “at the moment.” They are admissible as supportive science only if anchored by a persuasive event signature and pre‑offense documentation. The law’s job is to demand convergence and to police alternative explanations.

On specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go/antisaccade: probative of inhibitory control but state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation). Useful only with performance‑validity checks and cross‑test convergence.
- Stroop/WCST: low specificity to the mechanism we care about; I’d downweight WCST.
- Affective variants (emotional Go–No‑Go/Stroop) add relevance where triggers are affective.
- Hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and historical blood‑lead levels are mechanism‑plausibility enhancers, not clocks; they cannot timestamp the offense.
- fMRI has weak individual‑diagnostic value in this setting; at most corroborative, never dispositive.

Minimum bundle for clear‑and‑convincing (all must be shown; no single item suffices)
1) Event signature (contemporaneous, objective features)
- Rapid, provoked escalation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; body‑cam/911/witnesses noting dissociation or “seeing red.”
- Planned conduct (weapon procurement, ambush, flight with concealment) is a presumptive disqualifier.

2) Pre‑offense history of dyscontrol (nonforensic records)
- School/juvenile/clinical documentation predating the offense of stimulus‑bound explosive reactivity, dissociation, or Intermittent Explosive Disorder‑like episodes; sleep disruption records where relevant.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go), replicated or cross‑validated; intact performance‑validity testing.
- Trait profile consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression (avoid overreliance on PCL‑R).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, IED) with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger‑to‑act sequence; diagnosis grounded in exposures documented in Stage 1, not created post hoc.

5) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented developmental insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or any ≥10; verified early malnutrition/IDA; documented FASD risk) or robust pre‑offense chronic‑stress marker (e.g., hair cortisol flattening), tied to current executive deficits.

And all of the following exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as proximate cause defeats the excuse; baseline dyscontrol must be shown independent of intoxication.
- Malingering: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; consistency across sessions; collateral informants.
- Alternative causes: rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless that distinct doctrine is at issue), acute TBI at offense, and clear instrumental motives.
- State–trait control: standardize testing (sleep, caffeine, meds); prefer early testing plus pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds and reverse causation (incarceration stress flattening cortisol; acute sleep loss degrading performance).
- Measurement error/base‑rate fallacy: population associations do not prove individual causation absent the bundle above.
- Over‑interpretation of imaging and nonspecific tasks (WCST); misuse of PCL‑R.
- Coaching/secondary gain; selective impairment profiles without validity support.

Gatekeeping and administration
- Mandatory Daubert‑style hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Timeliness and provenance rules: heavy weight to pre‑offense records; hair cortisol segments that cover pre‑offense months; disfavor litigation‑generated evidence without external corroboration.
- Domain limitation: reactive interpersonal violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Jury management and disposition
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions limiting use of RSB science to the dyscontrol question; if the bundle is not met, channel the same evidence to sentencing mitigation or, in homicide, MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance.
- If excuse is found, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (with civil commitment only for those who remain dangerous) preserve legitimacy and victim protection.

Bottom line: With these guardrails, Stage 2 evidence can help a small class of cases meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard. Without them, the risk of error and inequity is too high.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle into courtroom practice? Specifically, propose a concrete gatekeeping protocol and a short model jury instruction for a narrow “reactive dyscontrol” excuse. I’d like: (i) the pretrial notice and Daubert hearing elements you would require; (ii) the disqualifiers to be stated up front (planning/cover‑up, substantial voluntary intoxication, malingering indications); and (iii) a succinct instruction defining reactive dyscontrol and the defendant’s clear‑and‑convincing burden, so jurors have a legible standard rather than a fog of expertese.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

- Big picture. I’m aligned with Dr. Chen: no single test can “time‑stamp” loss of control; the best we can do is a convergent, pre‑specified bundle that makes reactive dyscontrol highly probable in the instant event. If we don’t cabin it, we invite expert‑driven mini‑trials in every hard case. So the doctrine must be narrow, offense‑limited, and run through a rigorous Rule 702/Daubert gate before a jury ever hears it.

Are the proposed tools specific/temporally sensitive?

- Neurocognitive batteries. Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with a defensible SSRT) and antisaccade/affective Go–No‑Go are the most on‑point. Stroop and WCST are too nonspecific to carry much weight; I’d treat WCST as background only. All such testing is state‑sensitive; validity testing is essential and results should be replicated or corroborated.

- Stress markers. Hair cortisol (3‑month window) is more informative than single‑day salivary profiles, but still nonspecific. Historic childhood BLLs are probative of developmental insult if they predate the offense and line up with executive deficits; they do not speak to the “moment.” These are supportive, never dispositive.

What minimum bundle should meet clear‑and‑convincing?

I would require all of the following, with the defense bearing a clear‑and‑convincing burden; failure on any element defeats the excuse:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; no luring, staging, or concealment; disorganized execution. Preferably corroborated by contemporaneous evidence (video/911/body‑cam/witnesses). If the record shows planning or instrumental motive, the instruction should not go to the jury.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEPs/discipline for explosive behavior, juvenile/medical notes of dissociation or intermittent explosive episodes, prior ED encounters) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control. This addresses temporality and guards against reverse‑causation artifacts.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity and convergence
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and either replication across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Include a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available. Trait measures (e.g., PCL‑R) should not show a predatory profile; use them cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and phenomenology of the offense (dissociation, “seeing red”). Biological stress indices (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one developmental biological insult documented independent of litigation—childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or a prior ≥10), iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition records, or credible FASD risk—plus evidence that these exposures plausibly contribute to current executive deficits.

And all of these disqualifiers/controls:

- Voluntary intoxication. Substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as the proximate driver defeat the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.

- Malingering safeguards. Multiple validity tests, cross‑source consistency, and collateral informants. Be alert to “too bad to be true” or selective impairment.

- Alternative causes excluded. Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to the RSB exposures, acute TBI at the time of offense, and clear instrumental motives.

- Timing. Testing as early as feasible; heavy weight on pre‑offense records to avoid post‑charge/incarceration effects masquerading as baseline.

Scientific/legal pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and the stress of prosecution can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize test conditions; replicate when feasible; corroborate with pre‑offense records.

- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers. fMRI/EEG have low individual‑level forensic utility. Admit only as supportive and only if the method meets Rule 702 reliability and fit.

- PCL‑R misuse. Do not let trait instruments substitute for mechanism; avoid importing a “bad person” narrative.

- Resource inequality. If we recognize this defense, courts must ensure funding parity and consider appointing neutral experts; otherwise the doctrine will be both under‑inclusive for indigent defendants and vulnerable to disparate application.

Gatekeeping and guardrails (administrability)

- Offense limitation. Confine to genuinely reactive violent offenses (and perhaps a narrow class of truly impulsive nonviolent acts). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.

- Notice and proffer. Early notice (e.g., 60 days) with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above; Daubert hearing with court‑appointed neuropsych/psychiatry/environmental‑health experts.

- Jury management. If the gate is cleared, use a tailored instruction and special interrogatories requiring unanimous findings that (a) inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the time, (b) the degradation substantially caused the act, and (c) the degradation was not due to voluntary intoxication or planning. Bifurcate where appropriate to keep guilt and excuse evidence distinct.

- Disposition. Where the excuse is found, I favor ESB‑oriented, court‑supervised conditions (trauma‑focused treatment, housing relocation from criminogenic environments, nutrition/sleep stabilization, employment supports), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

Final note on scope

My own priors remain: (i) keep a true “involuntary‑rage/automatism” avenue for the rare, tightly‑defined case; (ii) channel much of the rest into MPC‑style EED (in homicide) and structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators; and (iii) resist societal‑fault apportionment at guilt. With the convergence and guardrails above, Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 framework can be made governable—but it must remain the exception, not the rule.

### Speaker: Host

Building on Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions, sketch the administrable architecture: (i) a pretrial admissibility standard and hearing (what specific proffer and neutral experts, what per se exclusions); (ii) the offense domain (reactive violence only? categorical carve-outs for predatory/ planned acquisitive crime and voluntary intoxication?); and (iii) a model jury instruction that defines “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause” without inviting a free‑ranging social‑history mini‑trial. Please be concrete about burdens of proof, unanimity, and how to cabin the evidence to protect legitimacy and avoid error costs.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment and proposal

I find Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions directionally sound. If we are to put this in a courtroom, we need a narrow, rule‑governed channel with clear elements, pretrial gatekeeping, and standardized proof. I would not recognize a free‑standing “RSB excuse.” The proper doctrinal homes are:

- Involuntary‑rage automatism (complete excuse) for a tightly defined subset of reactive violent offenses, and
- MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (EED) as a partial excuse in homicide.

Outside those lanes, RSB belongs at sentencing via structured mitigation.

pretrial gatekeeping

- Vehicle: Evidentiary hearing (Rule 104(a)/Daubert) on a defense proffer tied to enumerated elements; court may appoint neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Burden: Defendant by clear and convincing evidence.
- Scope limit: Presumptively available only for affective/reactive violent offenses (e.g., sudden assaults, some homicides). Exclude planned acquisitive crimes and organized post‑offense conduct.

involuntary‑rage automatism (IRA) – elements and minimum bundle

To submit IRA to a jury, require five pillars of convergence; two are mandatory.

Mandatory pillars
1) Event signature (proximate to the offense)
- Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions of dissociation (“saw red,” “went blank”), autonomic arousal; ideally video/911/body‑cam corroboration.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED; prior ED visits for rage episodes; documented chronic sleep disruption).

Plus any two of the following three

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with intact performance‑validity testing and either replication or cross‑test convergence; low–moderate psychopathic traits (supporting impulsive rather than predatory profile).

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to pre‑offense exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the trigger and dissociation in the index event. Chronic stress markers (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) are supportive, not determinative.

5) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one developmental biological insult (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a ≥10 µg/dL peak; iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

Disqualifiers/controls

- Voluntary intoxication: If a substance was a substantial proximate driver, the excuse is barred. Presence of alcohol/drugs requires showing baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Planning/instrumentality: Evidence of planning, weapon staging, luring, concealment, or clear instrumental motive defeats IRA.
- Malingering/state–trait: Multiple performance‑validity tests; consistency across sessions; standardize sleep/meds; give weight to pre‑offense records to avoid post‑charge artifacts.
- Primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI at the time of offense (unless separately excused under insanity).

jury submission and instructions

- Special verdict form with interrogatories on each pillar (and any disqualifier) to ensure disciplined reasoning.
- Limiting instruction: RSB evidence is admitted solely on the question whether the defendant’s volitional control was substantially impaired at the time of the offense; background alone is not a defense, and sympathy is not law.
- Burden instruction: Clear and convincing proof on each required element; unanimity required.

disposition if IRA is found

- Special verdict (“Not guilty by reason of involuntary rage automatism”) with authority for ESB‑oriented conditional release under court supervision (housing relocation, trauma‑focused therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines) and no‑contact conditions; periodic risk reviews.
- If the person remains demonstrably dangerous and meets civil‑commitment criteria (dangerous to others due to mental illness), commitment in a treatment facility; otherwise ESB supervision. Victims’ rights (notice, input) preserved.

EED in homicide

- Adopt MPC §210.3 “extreme emotional disturbance” with a “person in the actor’s situation” standard and admit structured RSB evidence to inform that perspective. This mitigates from murder to manslaughter; it does not exonerate.

sentencing mitigation (all other cases)

- Create a validated mitigation framework keyed to verified deprivation indicators (e.g., longitudinal ADI/ICE residence, school deprivation, CPS‑substantiated adversity, childhood BLLs/malnutrition), with ESB probation conditions. This is where most RSB claims should land.

administrability and floodgates

- By confining the excuse to reactive violence, demanding two mandatory pillars (event signature and pre‑offense documentation) plus two further converging pillars, and excluding intoxication and planning, very few cases will qualify for jury submission. Most claims are channeled to EED or sentencing.
- No single test time‑stamps loss of control; the law should accept only a convergent bundle, not isolated biomarkers (no fMRI show‑and‑tell).
- Resource parity: courts must ensure indigent defendants can access testing and records; otherwise the doctrine is illusory and unequal.

appellate guidance

- Require written findings on each pillar/disqualifier at the pretrial gate; review for abuse of discretion. Collect anonymized data on usage and outcomes for periodic rule calibration.

Bottom line: With Santiago’s structure and Chen’s cautions translated into a tight checklist, courts can honor Hart’s “fair opportunity to comply” limit without sacrificing administrability or public legitimacy. Where the alignment isn’t there, the right place for RSB remains EED (homicide) and structured mitigation at sentencing.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as our working template, are these administrable in a real courtroom? Please propose a concrete procedural architecture: (i) what the pretrial proffer and Daubert‑style hearing should look like (including timing and court‑appointed neutral experts), (ii) whether you’d bifurcate and what burden/standard you’d apply at the guilt phase, and (iii) a short model jury instruction that captures “substantial degradation of inhibitory control that substantially caused the act,” while cabining the doctrine (e.g., reactive violence only, intoxication bar, event‑level markers). Also, note the key error‑cost tradeoffs you’d try to minimize and how your design addresses them.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I read Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 as directionally right, but I would tighten it for courts. None of the proposed tests or biomarkers can, standing alone, time‑stamp loss of control. Their proper role is corroboration of an event‑level narrative of reactive dyscontrol, anchored in pre‑offense documentation and free of obvious alternative drivers. With that lens:

1) Are the tools specific and temporally sensitive enough?
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the most relevant to inhibitory control; Stroop is modestly informative; WCST is least specific and I would not give it much weight. Even the best tasks are state‑sensitive (sleep, motivation, meds) and not moment‑specific. They support mechanism, not timing.
- Stress markers: Childhood blood lead histories and documented malnutrition are probative of developmental insult but say nothing about the instant offense; diurnal or hair cortisol indicates chronic load with noise and confounds. Useful as background supports, not as dispositive evidence of offense‑moment impairment.
- Bottom line: Any inference to “substantial volitional impairment at the moment” must rest on converging lines—event signature + pre‑offense history + credible testing—with clear exclusion of alternative causes.

2) Minimum bundle I would require to meet clear and convincing
Make the defense satisfy each prong; failure on any one defeats the excuse. Limit to reactive violent offenses; planned acquisitive crime should be out.

A. Event‑level signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; no luring, staging, or concealment; disorganized execution. Prefer contemporaneous corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam, neutral witnesses describing “went blank,” “saw red,” autonomic arousal). If there is planning or instrumental motive, stop here.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense that show stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEPs/discipline for explosive behavior, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED episodes, ED visits), and sleep disruption where relevant. This addresses temporality and reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neuropsychological evidence with validity safeguards
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below demographically corrected norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal RT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), administered by a qualified examiner within 30–90 days, with multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and either test–retest stability or cross‑task convergence. Include a delay‑discounting measure if available. Downweight WCST.

D. Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured DSM‑5 diagnosis consistent with reactive aggression (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), established by a qualified clinician using validated instruments, with symptom content and triggers that plausibly explain the index conduct. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., hair cortisol) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation documentation of at least one biologically plausible exposure (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated, or one ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), plus residence/schooling records consistent with high deprivation. These inform mechanism; they do not prove the defense.

F. Exclusions/controls
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (toxicology and lay evidence). If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; generally, voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless proceeding under a different doctrine), acute TBI at the time, and malingering (multiple PVTs, collateral consistency).
- Trait profile not suggestive of predatory aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R used cautiously).

I would also require either concurrence from a court‑appointed neutral expert or, at minimum, a Daubert/Rule 702 finding that the specific application (not just the test in the abstract) is reliable.

3) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, detention stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer replication or cross‑source corroboration; give greatest weight to pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; be wary of selective, “too bad to be true” profiles. Require raw data to be available to neutral reviewers under protective order.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication should presumptively bar a dyscontrol excuse.
- Reverse causation and forensic artifact: Post‑charge stress and coaching can alter profiles. Hair cortisol can capture the pre‑offense window; still, treat biomarkers as supportive. Give primacy to documentation created before the offense.
- Ecological and demographic validity: Ensure neuropsych norms are demographically corrected; avoid cultural bias. Do not over‑interpret WCST or global deficits as “loss of control.”
- Base‑rate neglect: Many people with high ACEs or lead exposure do not offend; population associations cannot be simply ported to an individual. Demand the full convergence bundle.
- Neurohype: fMRI/EEG have limited forensic utility here; admit only, if at all, as non‑determinative supports with clear limiting instructions.
- Instrumental violence in reactive clothing: Texts, weapon acquisition, threats, and post‑event conduct often reveal planning. Require the State to be able to present such evidence robustly at the attribution hearing.

4) Procedural guardrails and placement
- Pretrial proffer/hearing: Structured template tied to the elements above; clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Bifurcation and jury instructions: If the defense clears the gate, instruct the jury that tests/biomarkers are supportive and not determinative; “substantial impairment” means marked diminution of inhibitory control, not mere difficulty, and it must be a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Offense domain: Limit affirmative excuse to truly reactive violent offenses; for everything else, channel RSB to mitigation at sentencing (where I would endorse structured ESB‑oriented dispositions keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators).
- Equality: Provide funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will be both under‑inclusive and unequal.

This is a narrow lane. Requiring event‑level reactivity, pre‑offense documentation, valid neurocognitive deficits, an objective developmental insult, and clean exclusion of intoxication/planning will keep the gate tight and the doctrine administrable. Where the bundle falls short, the right place for RSB is structured mitigation, not exculpation.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and evidence law standpoint, take Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as given. How would you translate it into a pretrial gate and jury instruction that satisfy Daubert/Rule 702 on reliability and fit while keeping error costs tolerable? Please be concrete: (i) what must the defense proffer at a Rule 104(a) hearing; (ii) do you require neutral court‑appointed experts; (iii) would you limit the excuse to reactive violence and require a special verdict on “substantial dyscontrol” by clear and convincing evidence; and (iv) what one or two elements of Chen’s bundle would you strike or heighten (e.g., hair cortisol, WCST) to avoid forensic artifact battles?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s bottom line: none of these instruments is time‑stamped to the moment of offense, and none is specific standing alone. But in a narrow class of reactive violence cases, a tightly structured, convergent bundle can support a clear‑and‑convincing finding that the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply (Hart) because inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the instant. The gate must be rule‑bound and offense‑limited or we risk confusion, inequity, and loss of legitimacy.

Assessment of the proposed tools
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑signal (SSRT), Go/No‑Go, antisaccade, and an affective inhibition task are the most probative. Stroop adds modestly; WCST is too nonspecific and should be down‑weighted. All testing must include multiple performance‑validity indices and, ideally, a re‑test on a different day to blunt state noise.
- Stress/toxin markers: Historic childhood BLLs (preferably repeated) and documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency are probative of developmental insult; hair cortisol offers a coarse 2–3 month window for chronic stress. None is dispositive; all are context evidence. I would exclude fMRI for adjudication (Rule 702/Daubert concerns about error rates, ecological validity, and jury over‑weighting).
- Event‑level evidence: This carries the heaviest weight—video/bodycam/911 audio/witness accounts that depict an abrupt, affective escalation with disorganization and no contemporaneous instrumental conduct.

Minimum bundle to reach clear and convincing (all must be present)
1) Reactive event signature
- Acute provocation to violence within seconds/minutes; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous observations of dissociation (“went blank”), marked autonomic arousal, or post‑event confusion. If planning or instrumental steps are shown, the excuse should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense from at least two sources (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits for rage episodes, probation reports noting stimulus‑bound outbursts).

3) Objective developmental insult
- At least one independently documented exposure consistent with the mechanism (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥10 µg/dL once or ≥5 µg/dL on two occasions; or clinically verified early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia; or well‑documented FASD risk), plus geocoded residence in high‑deprivation/high‑violence tracts for substantial childhood years.

4) Neurocognitive impairment with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and affective Go/No‑Go), with intact embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests and stability across sessions; a delay‑discounting or impulsive choice measure adds weight. Trait psychopathy should not be high; I would avoid overreliance on the PCL‑R but do require that the profile be reactive, not predatory.

5) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to Stage‑1 exposures and showing triggers/symptoms plausibly tied to the offense; biological stress corroboration is supportive, not required.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse (mitigation only).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB belongs under insanity, not here.
- Strong evidence of calculated motive, malingering (failed PVTs), or post‑event instrumental behavior defeats the excuse.
- Testing conditions standardized (sleep, meds) and timed as early as practicable, with heavy reliance on pre‑charge records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Scientific/legal pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medications, and litigation stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol; require re‑testing or collateral corroboration.
- Base‑rate and reverse‑causation errors: many with deficits never offend; post‑offense incarceration can alter biomarkers—use pre‑offense documentation where possible.
- Junk neurolaw risk: exclude glamor evidence (fMRI); insist on methods with known error rates and general acceptance; give limiting instructions (Rule 403) to prevent overweighting.
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple validity tests and neutral experts are essential.

Procedural safeguards
- Pretrial 104(a)/Daubert hearing tied to a standardized proffer checklist; clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to reduce adversarial bias; funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Offense limitation: confine to reactive interpersonal violence (and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions to preserve jury focus and reduce expressive harm.

Disposition
- If excused, noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep remediation, employment supports), with civil commitment reserved for those shown dangerous under applicable standards. This protects victims and public safety without signaling justification.

This is consistent with a narrow avenue I can endorse: (i) tightly bounded involuntary‑rage/automatism in reactive cases; (ii) MPC‑style EED limited to homicide; and (iii) structured mitigation at sentencing keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators. I would not extend to broad “societal fault” apportionment at guilt. With these guardrails, we honor Hart’s fairness limit without opening the floodgates.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your evidence-and-administrability hat, would Santiago’s/Chen’s five‑pillar gate (reactive event signature, pre‑offense dyscontrol records, validated inhibition deficits, a mapped DSM diagnosis, and at least one objective exposure biomarker) be workable at Daubert and trial? What would you exclude as too speculative (e.g., single‑day salivary cortisol, WCST), and how would you cabin jury use of biomarkers so they don’t over‑weight them? Please sketch the key elements of a limiting instruction and special verdict form, and say whether you’d require bifurcation and a narrow definition of “reactive offense” (and how to handle voluntary intoxication) to keep error costs down.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

I find Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate conceptually sound and, with the right evidentiary guardrails, administrable. But courts must be clear about what Stage 2 can and cannot prove. None of the proposed tests or biomarkers is temporally precise enough to “time‑stamp” loss of control. They are corroborative. The fulcrum is the event signature of a reactive, unplanned outburst; the rest must converge to make that account credible and attributable to long‑run exposures.

On the tools

- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the most relevant to inhibitory control. Affective variants (emotional Go–No‑Go/Stroop) are preferable where negative affect is the trigger. Classic Stroop and WCST have poor specificity to the mechanism and should be down‑weighted. Multiple performance‑validity tests are non‑negotiable.
- Stress/exposure markers: Historic childhood blood‑lead levels and documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency are probative of mechanism, not moment. Hair cortisol is a better chronic stress index than single‑day saliva but is still nonspecific and subject to confounds. Use as supportive, not determinative. I would bar courtroom fMRI/“brain pictures” under Rule 403 in most cases; the risk of undue prejudice outweighs marginal probative value at this time.

Minimum bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard

I would require all of the following (no single item suffices):

1) Event‑level phenotype of reactive dyscontrol
- Immediate escalation (seconds to minutes) after a salient provocation; disorganized, noninstrumental execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions or recordings evidencing “going blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal, and rapid de‑escalation. Any meaningful planning or cool‑down defeats the claim.

2) Pre‑offense corroboration of dyscontrol tendencies
- Nonforensic records created before the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits for rage episodes, documented chronic sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reduces “forensic artifact” concerns.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below age‑ and education‑adjusted norms (e.g., SSRT prolongation, antisaccade error rate, affective Go–No‑Go), with intact embedded and stand‑alone effort indices and either repeat testing stability or cross‑task convergence. Include a choice‑impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if feasible. Low–moderate trait psychopathy is supportive (impulsive rather than predatory profile), used cautiously.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- A DSM‑5 trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established by a qualified clinician using structured instruments, anchored to exposures documented in Stage 1, with symptom triggers that plausibly explain the index event.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, or a single ≥10; early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; documented FASD risk), pre‑dating the offense, plus geocoded environmental/housing records where available.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls:

- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as the proximate driver defeat the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; the bar should be high.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple performance‑validity tests; consistency across sessions; collateral informants. Be alert to “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles and selective impairments congruent with coaching.
- Alternative causes: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time of offense, and clear instrumental motives.
- Testing window: complete core testing promptly (ideally within 30–60 days) and, if feasible, re‑test to mitigate state noise (sleep, meds, legal stress). Heavily weight pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls the court should police

- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress depress performance and cortisol. Standardize conditions; corroborate with pre‑offense documentation or actigraphy where available.
- Reverse causation: Post‑charge stress can flatten cortisol; hair cortisol offers a pre‑offense window but is not dispositive. Contemporaneous nonforensic records are the best antidote.
- Base‑rate error/ecological fallacy: Many in deprived settings have these exposures without offending; Stage 1 only opens the door. Stage 2 must carry causation through event‑level proof and exclusion of alternatives.
- Over‑interpretation of “brain” evidence: Exclude glossy neuroimages; insist on peer‑reviewed methods with known error rates (Daubert/Kumho), standardized administration, and population norms appropriate to the defendant.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and fairness)

- Limit the domain: Confine the excuse to truly reactive interpersonal violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime and coordinated group offenses.
- Pretrial gatekeeping: Daubert/Kumho hearing tied to a structured proffer addressing each required element; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and records: Early notice; standardized templates for objective records (pediatric labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA, unemployment insurance, geocoded residence histories). Prioritize documents created before litigation.
- Burden and findings: Defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act. Consider special verdict interrogatories on each element to aid review.
- Rule 403 and instructions: Exclude unduly prejudicial demonstratives; instruct jurors that Stage 1 background is not itself exculpatory and may be considered only insofar as it bears on volitional control at the time.

Disposition

If the excuse is found, I favor noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision (housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, trauma‑focused treatment, nutrition/sleep supports, education/jobs), with civil commitment available where the person remains dangerous and meets statutory criteria. That balances Hart’s fairness limit (no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply) with victims’ protection and public legitimacy.

Bottom line

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 list, refined as above and coupled with Dr. Chen’s cautions, can support a narrow dyscontrol excuse without opening floodgates. Event‑level reactivity is the keystone; neurocognitive and exposure evidence should corroborate, not replace, that showing. With neutral experts, strict notice and Daubert enforcement, and a confined offense domain, courts can keep the gate tight and the doctrine principled.

### Speaker: Host

You were detailing pitfalls (state–trait confounds, malingering, acute intoxication) when your remarks cut off. Could you please complete that list—especially reverse causation and the “forensic artifact” problem—and then name one concrete modification to Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 criteria you would mandate to mitigate those risks (for example, a required category of pre‑offense records, a timing window for testing, or a categorical exclusion rule)?

---

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

Thanks, Chair. I largely agree with Prof. Santiago’s architecture: no single measure can time‑stamp loss of control, but a convergent bundle that aligns mechanism, history, and the moment can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow class of reactive cases. A few refinements and cautions:

On the proposed tools and their specificity/temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive batteries
  - Keep Stop‑Signal (SSRT) and Go/No‑Go; add antisaccade and flanker, and include an affect‑laden variant (emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop). These better approximate inhibitory control under negative affect—the context for most “reflexive” assaults.
  - Down‑weight WCST; it taps set‑shifting more than response inhibition and is nonspecific.
  - Always include multiple performance validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and, where feasible, re‑test to mitigate state noise (sleep, anxiety, meds).
- Stress/exposure markers
  - Hair cortisol (3‑month window) is preferable to single‑day salivary profiles; still supportive, not dispositive.
  - Historic childhood blood lead levels (BLLs) and documented early malnutrition/iron deficiency are probative of developmental prefrontal impact if they occurred in sensitive windows, but they do not speak to moment‑of‑offense control.
  - Consider autonomic indices (low resting high‑frequency HRV; threat‑potentiated startle) as supportive markers of impaired affect regulation.

Minimum converging bundle to support substantial volitional impairment (clear and convincing)
Require all five pillars below, with structured disqualifiers:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/preparation/cover‑up; contemporaneous signs of autonomic arousal/dissociation (“saw red,” “went blank”), ideally corroborated by video/911/bodycam.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the charge (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, prior ED/clinic notes of dissociation/IED, juvenile records of stimulus‑bound outbursts, sleep disruptions tied to environmental stress).

3) Neurocognitive impairment with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT delay, antisaccade error rate, affective Go/No‑Go), with intact performance‑validity indices and cross‑task convergence or stability on re‑test.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R; use cautiously).

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the event. Chronic stress marker (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of at least one biologically plausible early insult (e.g., repeated BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or single ≥10; documented IDA/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk) temporally preceding the emergence of dyscontrol.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless invoking a different doctrine), acute TBI at the time of offense, and clear instrumental motives (planning, gain).
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, consistency across sessions, and collateral informant reports.
- Timing safeguards: test early (30–60 days) where possible; triangulate with pre‑charge records to avoid “forensic artifact” effects.

Key scientific pitfalls for courts to watch
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, withdrawal, pain, legal stress can depress executive performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize pre‑test conditions; prefer repeated measures or pre‑offense documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use a multi‑method validity strategy; be wary of selective, “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” impairment confined to legally salient tasks.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition and are common in reactive violence; voluntary intoxication should ordinarily preclude the excuse.
- Reverse causation/post‑offense effects: Incarceration stress can alter cortisol and cognition; hair cortisol helps establish pre‑offense load; lean on historical records.
- Over‑interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI/EEG patterns are group‑level and not diagnostic for individuals; machine‑learning “classifiers” lack forensic validation and should be excluded or treated as purely exploratory.
- Base‑rate/ecological fallacy: Many people with high adversity or lead exposure never offend; do not infer causation from exposure alone. The event signature and pre‑offense dyscontrol history are essential.
- Measurement invariance and norms: Ensure tests use appropriate, demographically adjusted norms; consider language/literacy effects to avoid spurious deficits, but avoid “over‑adjusting” away genuine impairment.
- Gene–environment correlation: Family history may co‑travel with exposure; legally, the focus remains fair opportunity at the time, but experts should acknowledge these complexities to avoid overclaiming.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 criteria are directionally right. I would (a) tighten the battery toward inhibition under affect, (b) insist on pre‑offense documentation, (c) treat hair cortisol and historic BLLs as plausibility enhancers, not time‑locked proofs, and (d) make the event‑level signature and exclusion of alternatives do heavy lifting. With those guardrails and a clear‑and‑convincing burden, successful claims should remain rare and largely confined to prototypical reactive cases where mechanism, history, and moment align.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions as givens, could you propose a concrete model jury instruction (and brief special‑verdict questions) for a narrowly tailored dyscontrol excuse? Please build in: (i) clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; (ii) convergence requirements across exposure history, neurocognitive/clinical evidence, and event‑level phenomenology; (iii) confinement to reactive violent offenses; and (iv) explicit disqualifiers (substantial voluntary intoxication, planning/instrumental motive). Keep it tight and administrable.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Bottom line. None of the proposed tools is specific or time‑stamped enough, standing alone, to prove loss of inhibitory control “at the moment.” As admissible, convergent indicia, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a narrow slice of reactive cases. The court’s task is to insist on alignment across (a) the event signature, (b) pre‑offense documentation, and (c) current, validity‑checked neurobehavioral findings, while excluding alternative proximate causes.

Are the tests/markers fit for purpose?
- Neurocognitive batteries
  - Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go (with credible SSRT estimates) and antisaccade are the best available probes of inhibition; useful but state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation).
  - Affective variants (emotional Go‑No‑Go, affective Stroop) add face validity for affect‑triggered assaults; classic Stroop and WCST are broad executive measures and should be down‑weighted for specificity.
  - All testing must include multiple performance‑validity tests and, ideally, replication or cross‑test convergence to blunt state noise and malingering.
- Stress/exposure markers
  - Hair cortisol offers a 2–3 month window on chronic load; single‑day salivary profiles are too noisy. Even so, these are nonspecific correlates of stress, not moment‑of‑offense gauges.
  - Historic childhood blood‑lead records (particularly repeated elevations ≥5 µg/dL, or any ≥10) are probative of developmental insult to prefrontal systems; they bolster plausibility in the presence of executive deficits.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition/FASD documentation and sleep disruption records are supportive, not dispositive.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)
Require all of the following five pillars; no single pillar suffices:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; disorganized, unplanned execution; absence of luring, weapon staging, concealment, or calculated post‑event conduct. Prefer neutral corroboration (video/body‑cam/911 audio, disinterested witness accounts noting “blanking out,” tremor, hyperventilation).
- If there is evidence of planning or cover‑up, the excuse should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School/juvenile/clinical records predating the offense reflecting stimulus‑bound rage episodes, dissociation, explosive reactivity, chronic sleep disruption; not created for litigation.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT on Stop‑Signal or Go‑No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), with intact effort indices (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs) and cross‑task convergence or stability across sessions.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (not predatory) aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R, used cautiously).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index act
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and phenomenology of the offense. Biological stress indices (hair cortisol flattening, low HF‑HRV) may support but are not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult (historic BLLs, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, credible FASD risk), temporally preceding and plausibly contributing to current deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the offense, and strong instrumental motives.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, internal consistency, collateral informants; be alert to “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles.
- Timing: test as early as practicable and triangulate with pre‑charge records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, legal stress, medication changes depress performance and cortisol; standardize and, where feasible, retest.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge incarceration can flatten cortisol; prefer pre‑offense records and hair assays spanning pre‑offense months.
- Base‑rate/ecological error: high adversity raises population risk but does not prove individual dyscontrol at time t; juries need an instruction on this.
- Over‑interpretation/prejudice: fMRI/EEG should be admitted, if at all, only as background mechanism under robust Daubert scrutiny; risk of Rule 403 prejudice is high.
- Biomarker equity: hair cortisol varies with hair type/treatment; courts should demand methodological controls to avoid spurious group differences.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Notice and structured proffer keyed to the elements above; pretrial Daubert‑style hearing; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Standardized templates for documentary proof (medical labs, CPS/school/housing/EPA/ UI records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Limit offense domain to genuinely reactive violence (and the rare truly impulsive nonviolent act); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Clear and convincing burden on the defense that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Jury instruction (to preserve legitimacy)
- Advise that adversity and test deficits increase risk generally but do not by themselves establish loss of control at the critical moment; the question is whether, in light of all the evidence, the defendant’s ability to inhibit an impulsive act in response to the precipitating event was substantially impaired.

Disposition
- If excuse is found, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma treatment, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, job placement) with victims’ input; civil commitment only where statutory criteria are met. This aligns with public protection and avoids the expressive overreach that concerns retributivists.

With these gates, you will see few qualifying cases: a small fraction of reactive violent offenses will make it past the hearing, fewer still to successful excuse. That is where, in my view, the moral claim (Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit) is strongest and the institutional risks manageable.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle into courtroom practice? Specifically: (1) What should a Daubert/Frye pretrial gatekeeping order enumerate as necessary showings and acceptable methods (e.g., required records, testing windows, validity checks, disqualifiers like voluntary intoxication), and should the offense domain be cabined to reactive violence? (2) What limiting instruction and verdict form would you give to prevent leakage into general mitigation—i.e., define for jurors “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause,” and make clear what does not qualify? (3) Where do you set the burden (clear and convincing?) and who pays for/appoints neutral experts to avoid adversarial science? If you can, be concrete—propose a model gatekeeping checklist and a short model jury instruction—and briefly note how you are trading off Type I (false excuse) vs. Type II (false rejection) error costs.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions. The science can underwrite a narrow dyscontrol excuse only when mechanism, history, and the moment line up. What the law must add is administrability and crisp limiting principles. Here is how I would operationalize Stage 2 for courts.

1) Offense domain and burden
- Eligible offenses: reactive violent crimes (homicide, aggravated assault) and, in rare cases, truly impulsive serious nonfatal violence. Exclude planned acquisitive offenses and predatory violence.
- Voluntary intoxication: proximate intoxication defeats the excuse. Baseline dyscontrol can still mitigate at sentencing.
- Burden/standard: defendant by clear and convincing evidence must show (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time of offense and (ii) that this degradation was a substantial contributing factor in the act.

2) Gatekeeping procedure
- Pretrial Daubert/Kumho hearing keyed to a structured proffer. Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA/HUD, UI records; geocoded exposure history).
- Testing within 60–90 days where feasible; heavy weight on pre‑offense records to avoid forensic artifact.

3) Required convergence for Stage 2 (all five required)
A. Event signature (reactive)
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/staging/cover‑up. Prefer objective corroboration (video/911/bodycam) and contemporaneous witness descriptions of “seeing red,” dissociation, autonomic arousal.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school discipline/IEPs for explosive behavior, prior ED/clinic notes, juvenile files, sleep disruption). Establishes temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and cross‑session or cross‑task stability.
- Downweight WCST and classical Stroop as mechanism‑nonspecific; include delay discounting where available. Low–moderate trait psychopathy scores to support impulsive (not predatory) aggression.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage mapping to the event
- Structured‑diagnostic PTSD (especially dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder anchored in pre‑offense exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the index trigger/response. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) is supportive, not determinative.

E. Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one independent, pre‑litigation developmental insult: childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or a peak ≥10); documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; or well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk. These are not time‑stamps but supply causal plausibility when matched to the deficits.

4) Disqualifiers/alternative‑cause controls (any defeats or strongly undercuts)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver.
- Clear planning/instrumental motive, staging, or concealment.
- Primary psychosis/mania causally unrelated to RSB exposures; acute TBI at offense; malingering (failed PVTs/embedded validity, “too bad to be true” profiles).
- State–trait confounds unmanaged: acute sleep deprivation, medication changes, incarceration stress explaining the entirety of deficits without pre‑offense corroboration.

5) Scientific cautions for courts
- State vs trait: standardize testing (sleep, caffeine, meds), repeat or corroborate; privilege pre‑offense records. Hair cortisol offers a pre‑offense window; single‑day salivary profiles are noisy.
- Test selection: inhibitory control tasks (SSRT, antisaccade, affective variants) are most probative; WCST is least. fMRI/EEG should not be dispositive; admit only as supportive after a reliability showing.
- Base‑rate/ecological errors: avoid moving from group correlations to case certainty without the required convergence; the doctrine must remain rare.

6) Jury instruction (bifurcated or special interrogatories)
- Deprivation alone is not a defense. The question is whether, because of documented developmental insults and trauma, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an otherwise unlawful, reactive act was substantially impaired at the time such that he lacked a fair opportunity to conform to law (Hart’s fairness limit).
- If the excuse fails, RSB remains relevant at sentencing.

7) Disposition upon excuse
- Verdict form: “Not Responsible by Reason of Dyscontrol.” Dispositional hearing follows, with a presumption for ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines). Civil commitment available only upon the usual mental‑illness/dangerousness showing. Periodic judicial review; validated risk tools; victim‑safety conditions.

Why this is governable
- Narrow offense class; strict disqualifiers; requirement of five‑pillar convergence with neutral experts and performance‑validity checks; and a clear‑and‑convincing standard will keep this to the top tail of cumulative adversity where mechanism and moment align. Most RSB evidence will continue to do its work at sentencing, which is where, institutionally, it best belongs in the run of cases.

This framework respects Prof. Watkins’s desert concerns by reserving full exculpation for the no‑fair‑opportunity slice, addresses Ms. Whitford’s floodgates and victim‑protection worries through gatekeeping and ESB supervision, and stays within administrable evidentiary lines the trial courts can manage.

### Speaker: Time check

You have 15 minutes remaining. Please start to wrap up the discussion.

### Speaker: Host

From the bench, how would you operationalize the gate Santiago and Chen sketched? Please be concrete: (1) which measures would you admit under Daubert/Frye and which would you presumptively exclude or tightly limit (e.g., SSRT/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, Stroop vs. WCST, hair cortisol vs. single‑day salivary cortisol, historic blood‑lead levels, PCL‑R, structural/functional MRI); (2) your pretrial architecture (notice, court‑appointed neutral experts, standardized proffer, and whether the clear‑and‑convincing standard is applied at admissibility or only at the merits); and (3) a tight, two‑sentence pattern instruction that defines “substantial degradation of inhibitory control,” confines the excuse to reactive aggression, and carves out voluntary intoxication.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s structure and Dr. Chen’s cautions. At guilt, if we are to entertain a dyscontrol excuse at all, the science can only corroborate what the event itself and the defendant’s pre‑offense history already strongly suggest. None of the proposed measures is timestamped to the moment of the offense; their probative force comes from convergence, temporality, and fit with a reactive, unplanned episode. The gate must be narrow, rule‑bound, and policed in limine.

1) On the proposed tools and their limits
- Neurocognitive tasks
  - Stop‑signal (SSRT), Go/No‑Go, antisaccade, and an affective inhibition task are the best of an imperfect lot. They index trait‑like inhibitory control but are state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation). WCST adds little to the mechanism we care about and I would not give it much weight. Stroop belongs only as part of a battery.
  - Multiple, independent performance‑validity tests are indispensable; raw data should be discoverable to the prosecution’s expert.
  - Norms matter: ensure demographically appropriate norms and account for language/education to avoid confounding deprivation with testing artifacts.

- Stress/toxin markers
  - Childhood blood lead levels (BLLs) are probative of developmental insult when documented contemporaneously during sensitive windows. They do not speak to the instant moment but strengthen causal plausibility if paired with present‑day executive deficits.
  - Hair cortisol provides a rough three‑month window of chronic stress; single‑day salivary diurnal profiles are too noisy to carry much weight. Treat all stress biomarkers as supportive, not dispositive.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition records, FASD risk, and verified early sleep deprivation (with contemporaneous records) are supportive history, not moment‑level proof.
  - fMRI/EEG offer, at best, research‑grade associations; I would admit only under a strict Daubert scrutiny and as low‑weight corroboration.

2) Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
I would require all of the following five pillars, plus the disqualifiers below. No single pillar suffices.

A. Event signature strongly consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a provocative trigger; no luring, staging, or concealment; disorganized execution; contemporaneous witnesses (or audio/video) describing “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal, and post‑event confusion. If the record shows planning or instrumental motive, the defense should presumptively fail.

B. Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- School/juvenile, medical, or CPS records predating the offense reflecting stimulus‑bound rage/dissociation/IED‑like episodes, chronic sleep disruption, or similar regulation problems. This addresses temporality and blunts reverse‑causation claims.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity and convergence
- At least two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below well‑matched norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go/Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indices and either replication on a second sitting or cross‑test convergence. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy/antisocial trait scores help distinguish impulsive from predatory aggression but should not be overread.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD, dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented Stage‑1 adversities, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and phenomenology of the offense. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol) are supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; FASD risk; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition), temporally preceding the emergence of regulation problems, plus evidence that the severity of exposure tracks the magnitude of present‑day inhibitory deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; as a rule, acute alcohol/stimulant effects should not carry an RSB excuse.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the scene; malingering (multiple PVTs, consistency across sessions, collateral reports).
- Testing soon after the event (ideally within 30–60 days) with standardized conditions (sleep, meds) and, where feasible, repeat or collateral corroboration; heavy reliance on pre‑offense records to mitigate forensic artifact.

3) Scientific pitfalls the court should watch for
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, pain, withdrawal, and incarceration stress can depress test scores and flatten cortisol. Standardize and, where possible, replicate.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity checks; be wary of selective or “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Reverse causation: post‑charge stress can alter biomarkers; hair cortisol gives a pre‑offense window; historic BLLs must be truly historic.
- Examiner allegiance and publication bias: prefer court‑appointed neutral experts; require disclosure of all tests administered, not just favorable ones.
- Ecological validity/base rates: remember these are probabilistic markers with nontrivial false‑positive rates; anchor in event facts.

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Mandatory pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; use neutral court‑appointed experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (school/CPS/medical labs, EPA/HUD, housing, unemployment records; geocoded exposure history).
- Limit the doctrine to genuinely reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts); exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Clear jury instruction: the defense must prove that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act; mere hardship, anger, or character does not suffice.
- Bifurcation to preserve jury focus; funding parity for indigent defendants to avoid inequitable access.

Bottom line
Used this way—as a rare exception requiring alignment of event phenomenology, pre‑offense history, objective developmental insult, validated neurocognitive deficits, and a coherent psychiatric narrative—the Stage‑2 showing can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment at the moment of offense. Anything looser risks neuro‑hype, expressive harm, and floodgates.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you propose concrete jury‑instruction language for a narrowly tailored dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse? Please include: (i) the burden (clear and convincing); (ii) a definition of “substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time of the offense” keyed to reactive (affective) violence versus instrumental planning; and (iii) automatic disqualifiers (e.g., substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause, evidence of planning/cover‑up). Also note one or two admissibility conditions you would insist the court find at a Daubert‑style hearing before any such instruction is given, to protect against junk science and jury confusion.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

Big picture. Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally sound: none of the proposed tools can time‑stamp loss of control; they acquire probative force only in triangulation. Courts should treat neurocognitive tasks and stress markers as supportive of a mechanism, not as direct proof of momentary incapacity. Event‑level phenomenology and pre‑offense documentation carry the most weight; lab measures corroborate.

Are the measures specific/temporally sensitive? Only partly.

- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade indices of inhibition (SSRT, commission errors) are the closest fit, but they are state‑sensitive and not specific to RSB. They should be used in a small battery with affective variants (emotional Go–No‑Go/Stroop).
- WCST is weakly tied to inhibitory control; I would downweight or drop it.
- Diurnal/hair cortisol evidences chronic stress physiology, not momentary dyscontrol; treat as background plausibility.
- Historic blood lead levels (BLLs) are powerful for developmental insult if elevated in early childhood; they say nothing about the instant offense but strengthen the causal chain when paired with inhibition deficits.
- fMRI/EEG should be admitted, if at all, only as tertiary support after a Daubert gate; they are not case‑dispositive.

Minimum converging bundle (clear and convincing)

I would require all five pillars; missing any one defeats the excuse and relegates the evidence to mitigation.

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate eruption after a salient provocation; no luring, staging, or concealment; disorganized execution; contemporaneous indicia of autonomic arousal/dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”), preferably corroborated by 911/body‑cam/video or neutral witnesses. If the sequence shows planning or instrumental motive, the excuse fails.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Non‑forensic records (predating the offense) of episodic explosive reactivity/dissociation or impulse‑control problems: school IEP/discipline, ED notes, juvenile records, prior evaluations. This addresses temporality and guards against reverse causation.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below age‑/education‑adjusted norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), administered under standardized conditions, with multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) passed, and either test‑retest stability or cross‑task convergence. Include a delay‑discounting or similar impulsive choice assay if feasible. Trait profile should be inconsistent with predatory aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in the moderate–high range).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD with dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index act. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is helpful but not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Independent proof of at least one biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or ≥10 once; documented IDA/malnutrition; well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk) temporally preceding the emergence of control problems.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one is presumptively fatal)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver of the behavior.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to the RSB pathway (that is a different doctrine).
- Strong evidence of calculated, instrumental motive.
- Malingering/secondary gain: failure of performance‑validity tests, “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” patterns, or marked inconsistency across sessions/collaterals.

Scientific pitfalls for courts

- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, legal stress can depress executive performance and cortisol. Standardize testing (sleep/caffeine/meds), use actigraphy or collateral sleep reports if available, and prefer replication or pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/effort: Require multiple PVTs and embedded indicators; scrutinize selective underperformance.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication should defeat the excuse in all but the most exceptional, independently established dyscontrol cases, and even then generally only for mitigation.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑charge incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and degrade testing; give greater weight to pre‑charge documentation and historic medical/environmental records.
- Over‑reliance on imaging or single biomarkers: Admit only after reliability hearings; treat as supportive.
- Cultural/education effects on testing: Use demographically corrected norms and ensure language/reading demands do not artifactually depress performance.

Administrability guardrails (to keep the gate tight)

- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with a structured proffer tied to the five pillars; require notice and standardized documentary exhibits (geocoded exposure histories; lab records; CPS/school/housing/EPA/ UI files).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) for indigent parity and to reduce partisan science.
- Offense domain: confine the excuse to affective/reactive violent offenses; planned acquisitive crime should be out. Where the facts show chronic, simmering grievance rather than abrupt dyscontrol, the proper channel is MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (mitigation in homicide), not an excuse.
- Burden: on the defense, clear and convincing, to show substantial degradation of inhibitory control and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions: insulate the guilt decision from broad social‑science narrative; if the excuse is not reached, RSB evidence comes back at sentencing for structured mitigation.

Bottom line. With these constraints, the Stage‑2 toolkit is sufficient to support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a narrow band of cases that fit an involuntary‑rage/dyscontrol paradigm. Absent the full bundle, courts should treat the evidence as mitigation, not exculpation. This preserves Hart’s fairness limit while controlling error costs and protecting public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Santiago and Chen’s five‑pillar bundle into an admissibility and instruction framework a trial court can actually run? Specifically: (1) At a Rule 104(a)/Daubert–Kumho hearing, what checklist must the defense proffer before the jury hears any RSB‑dyscontrol evidence (objective exposure records, biomarkers, pre‑offense records, event signature, neurocog with validity, and explicit exclusions like voluntary intoxication/planning)? Who bears what burden, and when in the timeline should this be litigated? Would you appoint neutral experts and impose standardized templates? (2) Draft a concise model jury instruction defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and “reactive (affective) vs. instrumental aggression,” including the clear‑and‑convincing burden, what counts as probative versus insufficient (e.g., adversity alone), and a voluntary‑intoxication carve‑out. (3) What verdict form or special interrogatories would you use (complete excuse vs. mitigation‑only option), and should this be bifurcated from core guilt? (4) On appeal, what should be the standard of review for the gatekeeping decision and the instruction, and how would you handle harmless‑error analysis? Finally, address equality/administrability: how do we avoid a doctrine that only the well‑resourced can mount while keeping the gate tight and the floodgates closed?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Dr. Chen’s core point: none of these instruments can time‑stamp loss of control; they are trait‑leaning indicators that, at best, make a momentary dyscontrol inference plausible when they converge with the facts of the event and pre‑offense records. Used that way—and only that way—they can support a clear‑and‑convincing showing in a narrow band of reactive cases.

On specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) index inhibitory control reasonably well at the trait/state margin, but are noisy and effort‑sensitive. WCST adds little to the mechanism at issue (set‑shifting, not inhibition).
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) reflect chronic load, not the instant. Historic blood lead levels (BLLs) are developmentally probative but likewise non‑temporal. These are corroborators, not clocks.
- fMRI/EEG are, in my courtroom experience, more prejudicial than probative for this purpose; I would admit imaging only for limited, theory‑supportive context with a strict limiting instruction.

Minimum converging bundle (what I would require)
Treat this as an affirmative excuse with a clear‑and‑convincing burden. I would not let a jury hear it unless the defense proffers all of the following, plus exclusion of obvious alternative drivers:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam/witnesses) of “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal, confusion. If planning or instrumental aims are shown, the defense fails.

2) Pre‑offense documentary history
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound losses of control (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, ED/clinic notes of dissociation/IED, juvenile files; documented chronic sleep disruption). This anchors temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity and replication
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below demographically corrected norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade error rate, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with:
  - Multiple performance‑validity tests passed;
  - Either re‑testing stability or cross‑test convergence within 2–4 weeks;
  - Low–moderate psychopathic traits, consistent with impulsive, not predatory, aggression.

4) Objective exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented developmental insult (any of: childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a prior ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑supported FASD risk), OR
- Severe, verified trauma/adversity (e.g., substantiated CPS abuse/neglect or caregiver incarceration) plus elevated ACEs, tied to the history in (2).
- Stress physiology (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) may corroborate chronic load but is not required.

5) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) where symptom triggers plausibly explain the index event and are supported by longitudinal (pre‑charge) material.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, baseline dyscontrol must be shown independent of intoxication.
- Primary psychosis/mania (unless proceeding under an insanity pathway), acute TBI at the scene, or strong instrumental motive disqualify.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, collateral informants, internal test consistency. Be wary of selective “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” patterns.
- Timing and state effects: standardize sleep/meds; document recent sleep via collateral/actigraphy if possible; prefer pre‑charge records and repeat testing to minimize post‑arrest artifact.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, pain, medication changes, and litigation stress depress performance and cortisol. Require standardized testing conditions and, where feasible, a second session or corroboration from pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and worsen testing. Hair cortisol (pre‑offense 3‑month window) and old pediatric/CPS/school/EPA records help.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: neighborhood‑level deprivation is an eligibility screen, not causation. Do not let experts imply that population correlations alone explain the instant act.
- Over‑interpretation of imaging: avoid “brain‑made‑me‑do‑it” rhetoric; bar ultimate‑issue opinions on legal volition.
- Norms and fairness: use age/education/sex‑corrected neurocognitive norms; do not “poverty‑norm” performance in a way that normalizes impairment.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing with a structured checklist keyed to the five required pillars above; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden at this gate.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); ensure indigent resource parity or the doctrine becomes an equality trap.
- Limit domain: reactive interpersonal violence (and truly impulsive nonviolent acts in rare cases). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcation and instructions: use specialized instructions defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause”; bar “but‑for” causation language. Consider special verdict interrogatories on each element.

Bottom line
The tests and biomarkers are not, alone, specific or temporally precise enough. But if—and only if—the event looks reactive, the dyscontrol pre‑dated the crime in the records, the inhibition system is measurably weak with good validity, and there is at least one objective developmental insult or severe verified trauma tying mechanism to history, a court can let a jury consider dyscontrol on a clear‑and‑convincing standard. This keeps faith with Hart’s “fair opportunity” limit while containing error costs and preserving public legitimacy.

From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, suppose you had to draft (i) a pretrial gatekeeping order and (ii) a pattern jury instruction for an RSB‑dyscontrol excuse. What exact elements, burdens, and bright‑line disqualifiers would you include? Please be concrete: scope of eligible offenses (reactive violence only?), clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense, required categories of proof (event signature, pre‑offense records, neurocognitive testing with validity checks, at least one objective exposure biomarker), explicit exclusions (voluntary intoxication, planning), and whether to require neutral court‑appointed experts. Also specify how you’d instruct the jury on causation (“substantial contribution” vs. “but‑for”), and how to avoid correlation‑versus‑causation confusion.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

I agree with Dr. Chen’s central cautions: no single assay is specific or temporally precise enough to prove momentary loss of control. If courts are to admit Stage 2 evidence at all, it should be only as a convergent bundle that aligns mechanism, history, and the moment. From a gatekeeping and administrability perspective, here is the minimum showing I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard, together with the principal pitfalls to police.

A. Minimum converging bundle (all required)

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol, contemporaneously corroborated
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; seconds/minutes time course; disorganized execution; absence of luring, weapon staging, or concealment.
- Contemporaneous corroboration wherever available (911 audio/body‑cam/video; witness descriptions of “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal, post‑event confusion).
- Presumptive disqualifiers: evidence of planning (texts, staging, ambush), deliberate post‑offense concealment or flight consistent with instrumental aims.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity; juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/intermittent explosive episodes; ED visits for rage episodes; sleep disturbance tied to environmental stressors). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive evidence tied to inhibition/affect regulation, with validity safeguards
- Administered promptly (ideally within 30–60 days) with repeat or cross‑task convergence.
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below age/education‑adjusted norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal or Go/No‑Go with valid SSRT, antisaccade, and an affective variant such as emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop).
- Include delay‑discounting (impulsive choice) as supportive.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) showing adequate effort; stability across sessions where possible.
- Down‑weight WCST; it is not specific to the mechanism at issue.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured diagnostic workup by a qualified clinician establishing a trauma/impulse‑control disorder (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom triggers and phenomenology that plausibly explain the index event and pre‑date it in the records.
- Physiological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol) can be admitted as supportive only; not determinative.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult predating the offense (e.g., childhood blood lead levels ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated, or a prior ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑supported FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to the current inhibition deficits.
- These biomarkers do not “time‑stamp” the offense; they strengthen causal plausibility when aligned with Items 2–4.

6) Rule‑outs and negative controls
- Voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause defeats the excuse; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Exclude primary psychosis/mania unrelated to Stage‑1 exposures; acute TBI at the time of offense; malingering (guarded against by multiple validity indices and collateral consistency).
- Where feasible, within‑person or sibling contrasts (e.g., sibling without lead exposure) may be considered probative but not required.

B. Pitfalls and how courts should police them

- State–trait confounds: Executive performance and cortisol are state‑sensitive (sleep loss, meds, acute legal stress). Standardize testing conditions; prefer pre‑offense records; repeat or cross‑validate results when possible.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Require multiple PVTs; be wary of selective or implausible impairment patterns; look for cross‑source consistency (teachers, employers, medical records).
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; the law generally treats voluntary intoxication as non‑exculpatory. Toxicology and timelines must be clear.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑charge incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance. Hair cortisol gives a pre‑offense window but has its own confounds (hair treatments, ethnicity); treat as supportive only.
- Over‑interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI and quantitative EEG should presumptively be excluded absent strong Daubert showings of reliability, error rates, and general acceptance for forensic attribution. Historic BLLs and hematology are reliable; diurnal salivary cortisol is noisy—hair cortisol is better for chronic load but still not specific.
- Norms and cultural/educational bias: Ensure tests use appropriate age/education/language norms; avoid turning disadvantage itself into a proxy for impairment.

C. Procedural and doctrinal guardrails

- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing: Require a structured proffer tied to the elements above; appoint neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Pretrial notice and standardized templates for documentary proof (pediatric labs, CPS, school, EPA/HUD, housing, UI records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Offense domain: Limit to genuinely reactive violent offenses (homicide, aggravated assault) and a narrow subset of truly impulsive nonviolent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden and findings: Defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act. Use special interrogatories so the jury makes discrete findings on event signature, pre‑offense dyscontrol, neurocognitive deficits (with validity), clinical linkage, biomarker, and rule‑outs.
- Jury instruction: Anchor in Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply. Make clear this is an excuse, not a justification; sympathy for poverty is not a defense; voluntary intoxication defeats it.
- Bifurcation and resources: Consider bifurcating the excuse phase to protect the guilt determination; ensure funding parity for indigent defendants or the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

D. Bottom line on specificity and timing

Stop‑signal/antisaccade/affective inhibition tasks plus credible pre‑offense documentation and an event‑level reactive signature can, together, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment at the moment. Cortisol profiles and historic BLLs add weight on mechanism but should never carry the day. The error costs run both ways: false positives erode legitimacy; false negatives punish without fair opportunity. The “five‑pillar” bundle above, combined with strict rule‑outs, neutral expertise, and narrow offense scope, keeps the gate tight enough to avoid floodgates while honoring the law’s core commitment to fair opportunity to comply.

### Speaker: Host

From the bench’s vantage point, are Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five-pillar bundle administrable without turning every violent case into a sprawling mini-trial? If you had to operationalize this as (i) a pretrial admissibility protocol and (ii) a model jury instruction, what precisely would they say—burden, elements, permissible evidence, and limiting offense categories? Also, which error costs worry you most (false positives vs. false negatives), and how would you structure appellate review to keep the doctrine tight but not illusory?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly in the same place as Dr. Chen: none of these tools time‑stamps loss of control, and none should be dispositive. If we are to use Stage 2 at guilt rather than solely at sentencing, the court’s gate must insist on tight convergence across mechanism, history, and the moment, and keep the science in its lane under Rule 702/Daubert.

On the proposed measures

- Neurocognitive tasks. Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with a defensible SSRT) and antisaccade are the most on‑point for inhibition; affective variants (emotional Go–No‑Go/Stroop) add relevance to affect‑laden triggers. Classic Stroop and WCST are too nonspecific standing alone; WCST I would downweight. Require multiple performance‑validity indices and, ideally, re‑test or cross‑task stability to blunt state noise.

- Stress/biologic markers. Childhood blood‑lead records are probative of developmental hits to control systems if levels were elevated during sensitive windows; they are not event‑level markers. Hair cortisol provides a pre‑offense window for chronic load but is noisy (hair treatments, ethnicity) and should be supportive only. HRV/startle same—supportive, not determinative. I would not admit fMRI or other reverse‑inference neuroimaging for culpability; whatever their research interest, their forensic specificity and error‑rate profile are poor.

- Psychiatric linkage. A structured DSM‑5 diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) that maps plausibly onto the index event helps tie the strands together, but the court should scrutinize timing (pre‑offense documentation preferred) and avoid post‑charge, purpose‑built labels.

Minimum bundle to meet clear and convincing

I would require all of the following; failure on any one should presumptively defeat the excuse:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation after a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous indicia (“saw red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal) corroborated where possible (witnesses, 911/body‑cam). Evidence of planning/cover‑up is disqualifying absent extraordinary proof.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of stimulus‑bound rage/dissociation, ED visits) showing the same kind of episodic loss of control. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- At least two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below appropriate demographic norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with intact embedded and stand‑alone effort measures and either repeat testing or cross‑task convergence. Include a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if feasible. Use PCL‑R or trait instruments only to rule out a predatory profile, and with caution.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that fits the index act
- A structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician that explains how the documented exposures produce the observed, stimulus‑bound dyscontrol; supportive biological evidence of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) is a plus but not required.

5) Objective exposure biomarker/history consistent with mechanism
- At least one developmental biological insult documented outside litigation (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑founded FASD risk) plus the Stage‑1 deprivation/trauma profile. The court should demand that these exposures plausibly contribute to the current executive deficits.

And the following exclusions/controls:

- Voluntary intoxication. Where alcohol/drugs are the proximate driver, the excuse fails. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.

- Major alternative causes. Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless a different doctrine is invoked), acute TBI at the time, and strong instrumental motives.

- Malingering/forensic artifact. Multiple PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral informants. Be wary of “too bad to be true” profiles and late‑breaking symptoms. Prefer pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls the court should police

- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss, medications, pain, and incarceration stress degrade performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; consider actigraphy/collateral sleep documentation; use repeat or corroborated testing.

- Normative bias. Ensure neuropsych results are interpreted against appropriate age/education/language norms to avoid over‑calling deficits in low‑SES or minority defendants.

- Reverse inference/overreach. Ban or strictly limit flashy neuroimaging for culpability; insist on methods with known error rates and professional standards.

- Base‑rate neglect. Many individuals with similar deficits do not offend in this way; the moment matters. Event‑level corroboration should carry the most weight.

Procedural guardrails

- Pretrial reliability hearing tethered to a structured checklist (as above), with court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.

- Notice and standardized documentary proffers (medical labs, CPS/school/housing/EPA‑HUD/UI records; geocoded exposure histories).

- Offense limitation. Confine this excuse to truly reactive interpersonal violence (and, at most, rare impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.

- Burden. Clear and convincing evidence that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Disposition

If the excuse is found, it should not be an automatic walk‑out. I favor ESB‑oriented, court‑supervised dispositions (trauma therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, housing relocation, job pipelines), with civil commitment available for those who remain dangerous. That protects victims and preserves legitimacy without converting the courtroom into a broad tribunal on social policy.

Bottom line

As a gatekeeping judge, I would view Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 elements as directionally sound if tightened as above: give greatest weight to the event signature and pre‑offense documentation; treat neurocognitive and biologic markers as corroborative; and keep a sharp eye on the well‑known confounds Dr. Chen identified. Done this way, the doctrine remains narrow, principled, and administrable.

### Speaker: Time check

You have 15 minutes remaining. Please start to wrap up the discussion.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, from an administrability and error‑cost perspective, would you codify Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution as a pretrial, court‑screened excuse with a clear‑and‑convincing burden? If so, please specify the procedural architecture you’d adopt: Daubert‑style hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts, scope limits (e.g., reactive violent offenses only), model jury instructions distinguishing “substantial impairment at the moment” from character evidence, and any bright‑line disqualifiers (voluntary intoxication, evidence of planning). If not, where would you prune or tighten to keep juries from being swamped and to ensure parity for indigent defendants?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and with Dr. Chen’s cautions. None of the Stage 2 tools is specific or time‑precise standing alone; the law should demand tight convergence plus a reactive event signature before we infer “no fair opportunity to comply” at the moment of offense.

Answering your questions directly:

1) Are the proposed measures specific/temporal enough?
- Not individually. Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (SSRT) is the most mechanism‑relevant; Stroop and WCST are supportive at best. Hair cortisol is a chronic stress index, not a time‑stamp. Historic BLLs (lead) speak to developmental insult and plausibility, not momentary control.
- As a bundle, anchored to event‑level phenomenology and pre‑offense records, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of reactive dyscontrol in a narrow class of cases.

2) Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)
Make two elements mandatory, then require three additional converging showings; all must be consistent, and disqualifiers must be absent.

Mandatory
A. Event signature of reactive dyscontrol: Near‑immediate escalation to violence after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/preparation/concealment; contemporaneous descriptions (“saw red,” dissociation, marked autonomic arousal). Prefer corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam, witnesses).
B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol: Nonforensic records predating the offense (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, prior ED/clinic notes of dissociation/IED, juvenile findings). This addresses temporality and counters “forensic artifact.”

Plus three of the following four
C. Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity: ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact effort/performance‑validity testing and stability/cross‑test convergence. Add delay‑discounting as supportive. Low–moderate psychopathy scores to fit an impulsive (not predatory) profile.
D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event: Structured‑diagnostic PTSD (dissociative subtype) or Intermittent Explosive Disorder tied to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the trigger and dissociation. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) is supportive but not required.
E. Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism: Independent records of childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or any ≥10), or documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia, or credible FASD risk—occurring in sensitive windows—plus a plausible link to current executive deficits.
F. Dose–response coherence: The severity/duration of Stage‑1 exposures predicts the magnitude of measured deficits (e.g., higher BLLs with worse SSRT; higher ACEs with more affective lability), and similar dyscontrol episodes appear in pre‑offense records.

Necessary disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse (RSB history may still mitigate at sentencing).
- Exclude frank primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; exclude acute TBI at offense; exclude strong instrumental motives.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral informants.
- Timing: testing as early as feasible (ideally ≤60–90 days) and triangulated; rely on pre‑charge documentation to avoid incarceration‑induced artifacts.

3) Scientific pitfalls courts should watch for
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, legal stress can depress performance and cortisol; standardize/retetst where possible; use actigraphy/collaterals for sleep.
- Malingering/secondary gain: robust validity testing; beware selective or “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: differentiating chronic toxin history (lead, FASD) from contemporaneous alcohol/drug effects.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense stress can flatten cortisol and degrade testing; hair cortisol helps with pre‑offense windows; weight pre‑offense records heavily.
- Ecological/base‑rate errors: group‑level associations don’t decide the case; require individualized proof and a reactive event signature.
- “Neuro‑seduction”: colorful imaging is prejudicial; admit fMRI/EEG only if tightly tied to task‑based deficits and passes Rule 403/Daubert.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and equality)
- Pretrial Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing; structured proffer keyed to the elements above.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); parity funding for indigent defendants.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS/school/housing/EPA‑HUD/UI records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Narrow offense domain: presumptively reactive violent offenses; planned acquisitive crime excluded.
- Burden: defendant must prove substantial degradation of inhibitory control and that it was a substantial contributing cause—by clear and convincing evidence.
- Trial management: bifurcation; specialized limiting instructions to prevent “character by adversity” drift; special verdict forms on the two prongs.
- Evidence hygiene: privilege robust performance‑based measures; downweight WCST; treat Stroop as ancillary; prefer hair‑cortisol over single‑day saliva; do not require neuroimaging.

Channeling and disposition
- Many who clear Stage 1 will not clear Stage 2; their RSB evidence should be reserved for MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or structured mitigation at sentencing, not guilt.
- Where the excuse succeeds, dispositions should be ESB‑oriented under court supervision (trauma‑focused care, safe housing/relocation, nutrition/sleep, employment pathways); civil commitment remains available where statutory criteria (mental illness plus dangerousness) are met. Include victim‑protection conditions and a victim voice.

Bottom line
The Stage‑2 batteries and markers, used cautiously and in convergence with a reactive event signature and pre‑offense documentation, can satisfy a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a small class of cases. The combination of mandatory event‑level proof, objective developmental insult, validated executive deficits, psychiatric mapping, and exclusion of intoxication/planning keeps the gate narrow enough to avoid floodgates and preserves legitimacy while honoring Hart’s fairness limit.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the lines Prof. Santiago sketched and Dr. Chen vetted, could you draft what a model pattern jury instruction should say and what a judge’s pretrial proffer checklist should require? Please specify: (1) the operative elements the jury must find by clear and convincing evidence; (2) categorical exclusions (e.g., voluntary intoxication, planned/instrumental offenses); and (3) a concise, step‑by‑step proffer that trial judges can use at a Daubert‑style hearing to gatekeep the evidence. Feel free to propose a verdict form (e.g., Not Guilty by Reason of Dyscontrol) and note whether you’d bifurcate the proceeding to preserve jury focus.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly in accord with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage structure and Dr. Chen’s cautions. Stage 2 is where courts will win or lose administrability. No single test or biomarker can time‑stamp loss of control; the law should demand tight convergence, rigorously policed for alternative explanations, and confine the doctrine to truly reactive interpersonal violence.

Are the proposed measures specific/temporally sensitive enough?
- Alone, no. Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go and related tasks index inhibitory control but are state‑sensitive; Stroop and WCST are even less specific. Hair/diurnal cortisol shows chronic load, not momentary incapacity. Historic BLLs speak to developmental insult, not the instant act. fMRI is, at this point, supportive at best and freighted with Rule 403 concerns.
- Together, if they line up with event‑level phenomenology and pre‑offense records, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment at the time of a reactive assault.

Minimum bundle I would require (defense burden: clear and convincing), with no single item sufficient:
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate eruption after a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous observations (video/911/witness) of “blanking out,” autonomic arousal; post‑event confusion helps but is not decisive.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the charge showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile clinic notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits, sleep disruption tied to neighborhood stressors).

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity checks
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), replicated or cross‑validated; multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests intact; trait measures consistent with impulsive, not predatory, aggression.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures; symptom triggers plausibly explain the index act. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) may support but should not be required.

5) Objective developmental insult or deprivation biomarker
- Independent documentation (pre‑litigation) of at least one biologically plausible insult (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk) or verified severe deprivation marker (e.g., prolonged extreme crowding with sleep disruption) that plausibly contributes to current executive vulnerabilities.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless separately addressed under insanity), acute TBI at offense, and instrumental motives.
- Guard against malingering: multi‑method effort testing, cross‑session consistency, collateral informants.
- Address state–trait confounds and reverse causation: standardize testing conditions; prefer early testing; lean on pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Scientific pitfalls for courts to watch
- State–trait noise (sleep loss, meds, acute legal stress) depressing test scores.
- Coaching/secondary gain on symptom inventories and simple tasks.
- Over‑interpretation of non‑specific markers (cortisol, HRV) and neuroimages; admit as supportive only, with careful Rule 702/703/403 scrutiny.
- Post‑offense incarceration effects mimicking chronic stress biology.

Gatekeeping/administrability safeguards
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing keyed to a standardized proffer mirroring the five‑pillar bundle; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Notice and uniform documentary templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA, unemployment records; geocoded exposure histories). Protective orders to facilitate record access.
- Offense domain: limit to reactive interpersonal violence (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent bursts). Exclude planned acquisitive crime and cases with cooling‑off or staging intervals.
- Bifurcation and specialized instructions: jurors should be told this is a narrow excuse grounded in lack of fair opportunity to comply at the moment, not a general “bad background” defense. Use special verdicts on each element.

Disposition
- If excused, avoid carceral punishment; order ESB‑oriented, court‑supervised conditions (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines). Reserve civil commitment for those meeting standard dangerousness criteria with mental disease; otherwise, structured ESB probation with risk monitoring.

Bottom line
With pre‑specified elements, neutral expertise, and a narrow offense scope, Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 can be made governable. The minimum bundle above operationalizes Hart’s fairness limit while keeping the gate tight enough to avoid floodgates and protect public legitimacy.

From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, do Santiago/Chen’s two‑stage gate and five‑pillar convergence get you comfortable, or what would you tighten? Please be concrete: (i) outline a Daubert-style pretrial protocol (what documentary proffer, which neutral experts, and what exclusions) to cabin the defense to reactive violence; (ii) propose jury instruction language that requires clear‑and‑convincing proof that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and a substantial factor in the instant act, and that expressly disqualifies planned or intoxication‑driven offenses; and (iii) specify funding/appointment safeguards to avoid wealth‑based disparities. If you’d change the burden or offense domain, say so and why.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage structure and Dr. Chen’s cautions. For courts, the question is less “can science pinpoint the second of dyscontrol?” than “is there clear and convincing, convergent proof that, at the moment, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit was substantially degraded by long‑running, verified exposures?” No single test or biomarker can do that work; a disciplined bundle can.

What I would require at Stage 2 (attribution) to reach clear and convincing:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Acute provocation and rapid escalation; disorganized act; no luring/preparation/concealment.
- Contemporaneous corroboration preferred: 911/body‑cam/video, witness descriptions of “blanking out,” tachypnea/tremor; brief post‑event confusion.
- If planning/goal‑directed features are present, the excuse should presumptively fail.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive behavior, juvenile clinic notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits), to address temporality and avoid reverse‑causation.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity and specificity to inhibition/affect
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD on at least two inhibition/affect‑linked tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go with reliable SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity indices passed and either replication or cross‑test convergence.
- Downweight WCST; it’s not specific to inhibition. Use Stroop only as part of a broader battery.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive, not predatory (use PCL‑R cautiously or alternative trait measures).

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the offense
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to Stage 1 exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and response in the index event.
- Physiological corroboration (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one developmental biological insult documented before the offense: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or a prior ≥10), or clear records of iron‑deficiency/malnutrition or FASD risk. These do not time‑stamp the episode, but they strengthen causal plausibility when paired with (3).

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse (absent non‑voluntary intoxication).
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania/TBI as alternative causes unless pursued under the appropriate doctrine (insanity).
- Robust malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; consistency across sessions; collateral informants.
- Standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine); where feasible, repeat testing or corroborate with pre‑offense data.

On the proposed tools’ probative value
- Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (with sound SSRT estimation) and antisaccade are the most probative behavioral indices of inhibition we have; still susceptible to state noise and motivation—hence the need for validity checks and replication.
- Stroop adds limited value alone; keep it in a battery.
- WCST should not be a pillar.
- Diurnal salivary cortisol is noisy; hair cortisol offers a 2–3 month window for chronic load but is nonspecific and subject to confounds (hair treatment, ethnicity). Treat all stress markers as supportive context, not determinative.
- Historic BLLs are developmentally probative if recorded in sensitive periods; they are never dispositive of the moment.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, legal anxiety can depress performance and cortisol. Prefer pre‑offense records; standardize and, if possible, repeat.
- Malingering/secondary gain: use batteries with strong PVT coverage; be alert to “selective” or “too bad” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: disentangle from baseline dyscontrol; generally a bar to the excuse.
- Reverse causation: avoid over‑reliance on post‑charge testing; anchor to pre‑offense records.
- Neuro‑overclaiming: fMRI/brain images are high‑prejudice/low‑incremental value for timing; admit, if at all, only as explanatory support under Daubert with Rule 403 scrutiny.

Procedural guardrails (to keep this governable)
- Notice and a pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tied to specified elements; defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden on (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) substantial contribution to the instant act.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health to avoid partisan “hired‑gun” battles.
- Limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and, in rare instances, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Use special verdict interrogatories to cabin juror discretion (e.g., findings on provocation/immediacy, planning, test validity, diagnosis mapping, exposure biomarker).
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions explaining that this is an excuse (not a justification), available only if the jury finds the specified elements.

Disposition
- If the excuse is found, default to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (removal from criminogenic context, trauma‑focused treatment, sleep/nutrition interventions, lead abatement if relevant, job pathways). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous under established standards.

Bottom line
- The Santiago/Chen bundle—event phenomenology + pre‑offense dyscontrol + two validated inhibition deficits + diagnosis that maps to the event + at least one objective developmental insult, with intoxication/malingering/alternative‑cause exclusions—meets my fairness and administrability concerns. It will make this a rare excuse, focused on the narrow band of cases where mechanism, history, and moment align, while preserving public legitimacy and victim protection.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and jury‑management standpoint, could you sketch the core instruction architecture for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse? Specifically: (i) would you codify it as an affirmative defense with a clear‑and‑convincing burden; (ii) what precise instruction language would map Hart’s “fair opportunity to comply” limit into a lay standard (e.g., reactive event only, seconds–minutes after salient provocation; no substantial voluntary intoxication); and (iii) would you use special verdict interrogatories (e.g., whether RSB‑caused substantial impairment of inhibitory control was a substantial factor) to guide juries and appellate review. Please be concrete about phrasing and any neutral‑expert/Daubert gating you’d require to keep equality and error costs in check.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Short answer. None of the proposed tools (stop‑signal, Stroop, WCST, cortisol, historic BLLs) is, standing alone, specific or time‑precise enough to prove loss of volitional control at the moment of offense. Used as a convergent bundle—anchored by event‑level facts and pre‑offense documentation—they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of reactive dyscontrol in a narrow class of cases. The law’s job is to translate that into a tight, administrable gate.

On specificity and temporality
- Neurocognitive tasks
  - Best-in-class for inhibition: stop‑signal (SSRT), Go/No‑Go, antisaccade; add an affective variant (emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop) because triggers are affect‑laden.
  - Stroop (classic) and WCST are weakly specific to the mechanism; I would down‑weight WCST.
  - All testing must include multiple performance‑validity tests and standardization (sleep, meds, caffeine).
- Stress/exposure markers
  - Hair cortisol (3‑month window) is more informative than single‑day salivary profiles but is still nonspecific; ethnicity and hair treatment matter.
  - Historic blood lead (BLL) in childhood is probative of developmental insult if measured during sensitive periods; it is not a moment‑of‑offense marker.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition and FASD risk are supportive context, not dispositive.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)
Require all six elements below; no single element suffices, and failure on any of the disqualifiers defeats the claim:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation following a salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of planning/cover‑up; contemporaneous descriptions (“saw red,” blanked out, obvious autonomic arousal). Prefer objective corroboration (video/911/bodycam).

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption tied to environment).

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity indices, and stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented adversities, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index event. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol) is supportive but not required if the rest is strong.

5) Objective developmental exposure biomarker
- At least one independently documented biological insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated, or a ≥10 µg/dL event; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk). If historic labs are unavailable, I would accept a narrow substitute only where there is (i) contemporaneous housing/code or HUD/EPA lead hazard documentation for the residence during childhood, plus (ii) pre‑offense cognitive/behavioral records consistent with executive dysfunction; but the preference is a direct biomarker to keep the gate tight.

6) Dose–response/temporality and fit
- Show that exposure severity (lead, ACEs, sleep/crowding) plausibly predicts measured deficits; and that these impairments pre‑dated the offense (school/juvenile records), not created post‑charge.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one defeats the excuse)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver of the act.
- Strong evidence of instrumental planning (weapon staging, luring, concealment) or clear pecuniary motive inconsistent with reactive violence.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to the RSB pathway; acute TBI at the time of offense.
- Malingering or unreliable testing (failed performance‑validity measures, “too bad to be true” patterns).
- Testing conducted so late, or under such confounded state conditions (severe sleep loss, acute withdrawal), that results are not probative—and cannot be corroborated by pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep deprivation, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress executive performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize and, where feasible, repeat; lean on pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: over‑weight records and biomarkers that predate the offense; be cautious with post‑charge findings.
- Task specificity: avoid over‑interpreting WCST and classic Stroop; prioritize inhibition/affect tasks.
- Biomarker overclaiming: fMRI and EEG are not time‑stamps; admit only, if at all, as modestly supportive under Rule 702/Daubert with careful limiting instructions.
- Performance validity: require multiple PVTs; look for cross‑source consistency (teachers, supervisors, medical notes).

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Notice and a structured pretrial proffer keyed to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Early testing (ideally ≤60–90 days post‑offense) and reliance on pre‑offense, nonforensic records to mitigate forensic inflation.
- Limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and only exceptionally to truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Defense bears the clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

A word on instructions and fit with doctrine
- Frame this as an excuse (not a justification): the conduct remains wrongful; the actor lacked a fair opportunity to comply (Hart).
- Require the jury to find both severity and causal contribution; define “substantial” as a significant causal role without which the offense would likely not have occurred, or would have been materially less grave, and not merely that adversity made compliance harder.
- Preserve existing lanes: automatism for truly involuntary acts; MPC‑style EED for homicide where the lens is “a person in the actor’s situation”; and sentencing mitigation when the proof falls short at guilt.

Bottom line. As Prof. Santiago and Dr. Chen suggest, these tools are probative only in convergence. If courts insist on the six‑part bundle above, apply the disqualifiers rigorously, and cabin the offense domain, the inference of substantial volitional impairment can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a small fraction of cases without opening the floodgates or compromising public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence as a working template, how would you formalize this in the courtroom to keep the gate tight and the task intelligible to jurors? Please be concrete about (i) a Daubert/Frye admissibility framework—what instruments/biomarkers you would generally admit as relevant and reliable (e.g., SSRT and affective Go–No–Go yes; WCST or stand‑alone fMRI no; hair cortisol only as supportive), and (ii) a model jury instruction that operationalizes “substantial degradation of inhibitory control was a substantial contributing cause” without inviting nullification. Would you also mandate court‑appointed neutral experts and a clear‑and‑convincing burden at the guilt phase?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage approach, but Stage 2 must be tighter and anchored in contemporaneous, event‑level proof. These tools are, at best, probabilistic trait indicators; they support an inference of degraded control only when they converge with the “signature” of a reactive, unplanned assault and pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol. Courts should treat most physiological assays as corroborative, not dispositive, and exclude showy but nonspecific neuroimaging.

Admissibility and framing
- Daubert/Rule 702 gate: require methods with known error rates, peer review, standards, and general acceptance. fMRI for individual responsibility fails that test today; HRV/cortisol/hair cortisol are supportive only.
- Offense domain: limit to affective/reactive violence where loss of control could matter (not planned acquisitive crime).
- Burden/standard: clear and convincing evidence that inhibitory control was substantially degraded and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the instant act.
- No voluntary intoxication: significant self‑induced intoxication as a proximate driver should defeat the excuse.

Minimum converging bundle (all seven required)
1) Event signature (most probative)
- Rapid escalation after a salient provocation; seconds/minutes latency; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous corroboration (video/body‑cam/911 audio/witnesses) of “blanking out,” autonomic arousal, confusion.

2) Pre‑offense documentation (temporality)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, ED/clinic notes for dissociation or intermittent explosive episodes, juvenile records); not created post‑charge.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity (mechanism)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks tightly linked to control (e.g., Stop‑Signal Reaction Time, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus a choice impulsivity measure if available; intact multiple performance‑validity tests; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Downweight WCST; it’s nonspecific to inhibition.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD with dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician; symptom triggers plausibly explain the event; low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits supporting an impulsive, not predatory, profile.

5) Objective developmental insult (plausibility)
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one biological insult during sensitive periods: repeated childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (ideally a prior ≥10), documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or well‑documented FASD risk. This is plausibility, not timestamping.

6) Exclusion of alternative proximate drivers
- Toxicology excludes substantial voluntary intoxication as the principal cause; rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the event, or clear instrumental motives.

7) Alignment with Stage 1 dose–response
- Demonstrate that the severity/duration of documented exposures (lead, malnutrition, chronic violence) align with the magnitude of current inhibitory deficits and with the person’s pre‑offense dyscontrol history.

Scientific pitfalls the court should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, withdrawal, pain, or legal stress can depress test performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing, consider actigraphy/collaterals, and repeat key tasks where feasible.
- Malingering/secondary gain: insist on multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; be wary of selective or “too bad to be true” profiles and coaching.
- Acute intoxication: alcohol/stimulants readily degrade inhibition; the doctrine should not excuse intoxication‑driven violence.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑arrest stress can alter cortisol and cognition; pre‑charge records are critical.
- Base‑rate and multiple comparisons: experts should report effect sizes, normative adjustments (education/culture), and test–retest reliability; courts should be alert to p‑hacking and expert shopping.

Weighting of specific tools
- Most weight: event‑level corroboration; pre‑offense dyscontrol records; inhibition tasks with validity checks.
- Moderate, corroborative weight: historic BLLs during childhood; hair cortisol for chronic load (with methodological caveats); HRV; ACEs when independently corroborated.
- Low/inadmissible: WCST as a primary marker; fMRI/EEG offered to “prove” individual nonresponsibility.

Procedural safeguards
- Pretrial structured proffer tied to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized templates for retrieving school, medical, CPS, housing, and environmental records.
- Specialized jury instruction keyed to Hart’s “fair opportunity to comply,” explaining that poverty alone is not an excuse; the issue is substantial degradation of control in this episode.

Disposition
- If the bundle is met, channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions with tight supervision; use civil commitment only where lawful and necessary for demonstrable ongoing dangerousness.
- If the bundle falls short, treat the same evidence as mitigation (or, in homicide, as MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance) rather than a full excuse.

Bottom line
Event‑proximate proof and pre‑offense documentation do the work; trait batteries and stress biomarkers corroborate. Require all pieces to align, and most cases will screen out at the gate. This keeps the doctrine narrow, principled, and administrable.

### Speaker: Host

Assuming we adopt Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence and a clear‑and‑convincing burden, what procedural architecture would make this administrable? Please be concrete: (i) outline a short pretrial gatekeeping checklist (Daubert factors, required documents, neutral experts, bright‑line exclusions like voluntary intoxication and evidence of planning), and (ii) draft a skeleton jury instruction defining “reactive dyscontrol” and its elements, including how to weigh event‑level phenomenology versus test results. Would you bifurcate guilt/defense, and if so, at what stage would the jury hear the RSB evidence to minimize prejudice while preserving the defendant’s right to tell their story?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Host, three judgments from the bench: specificity, the minimum bundle, and how to keep the gate narrow without inviting pseudo‑science or unduly burdening juries.

1) Are these tools specific and temporally probative?
- Event signature is doing most of the legally relevant work. Affective, near‑instant escalation; disorganized execution; no luring or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions (“went blank,” “saw red”)—these are the closest we can get to the moment of offense. Without this, the rest is weak tea.
- Neurocognitive batteries (Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop/Flanker) can show trait‑level inhibitory deficits. They are not time‑stamped to the offense, and scores are state‑sensitive. Use them as corroboration, never as a stand‑alone.
- WCST is too nonspecific; downweight or omit. Include effort/validity tests in all batteries.
- Stress markers (hair cortisol > salivary diurnal) and historic BLLs speak to mechanism and temporality (developmental insult) but are not offense‑moment measures. Treat as supportive only.
- fMRI/EEG: high Rule 403 risk; admit, if at all, only as limited corroboration with a cautionary instruction.

Bottom line: none of these, alone, proves loss of control “then and there.” They can, in convergence with a compelling event signature and pre‑offense documentation, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment.

2) Minimum converging bundle (defense’s clear‑and‑convincing burden)
Require all four pillars; failure on any defeats the excuse:

A. Index‑event markers (must have)
- Acute provocation; seconds‑to‑minutes latency; disorganized/impulsive act; no preparatory steps or concealment.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam/witness) of dissociation or marked autonomic arousal.

B. Pre‑offense, nonforensic record of dyscontrol (must have)
- School/juvenile/clinical records predating the offense documenting stimulus‑bound rages, dissociation, or impulse‑control failures (IEPs, suspensions for explosive behavior, ED notes). This anchors temporality and avoids reverse‑causation artifacts.

C. Objective developmental insult or chronic adversity biomarker (must have at least one)
- Childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated or ≥10 once) or documented lead hazard residence; or
- Verified early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency (labs/medical/WIC); or
- FASD‑risk documentation; or
- Substantiated severe ACEs (CPS‑confirmed abuse/neglect, caregiver incarceration, witnessed violent death) plus corroborated chronic sleep disruption from environmental stressors.
These connect Stage 1 exposures to plausible neural mechanisms.

D. Neuropsychiatric linkage with validity (must have all)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (SSRT/Go–No‑Go/antisaccade/affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity indicators intact and, if feasible, stability across sessions.
- Low/moderate psychopathic traits (to favor reactive over predatory aggression).
- A structured‑interview diagnosis that maps to the index event (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented exposures; biological stress indices (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) are supportive but not required.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver; planned or instrumental crime; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; malingering (failed validity testing).

3) Scientific pitfalls to watch
- State–trait confounds: sleep deprivation, acute legal stress, meds can depress test scores and cortisol. Standardize conditions; prefer pre‑offense records; consider repeat testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: use multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; beware selective or “too bad to be true” impairments.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: neighborhood deprivation does not prove individual dyscontrol; many with deficits never offend.
- Norms and cultural fairness: ensure demographic‑appropriate norms; language/education effects can mimic impairment.
- Criterion contamination: clinicians inferring causation from the same narrative offered to the jury—insist on independent, pre‑charge documentation.
- PCL‑R misuse: avoid overreliance; use as one piece, mindful of error and bias.

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability and legitimacy)
- Pretrial Rule 702/Daubert hearing with a structured checklist tied to the pillars above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Notice and standardized proffer (medical/CPS/school/housing/EPA/UI records; geocoded history).
- Clear and convincing burden on the defense; limiting instruction that “hard life” or mere impulsivity is insufficient—the jury must find substantial impairment of the capacity to conform conduct at the time of offense.
- Confine at guilt to reactive interpersonal violence (and, if at all, a narrow class of truly impulsive nonviolent acts); channel the rest to sentencing mitigation.

5) Disposition
- If excused, prefer ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep, employment supports) with judicial supervision; civil commitment only where current dangerousness is proven by appropriate standards.

This keeps faith with Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit while honoring the institutional cautions: a narrow offense domain, pre‑specified evidentiary thresholds, neutral expertise, and a focused instruction. It will make successful assertions rare and credible—closer to involuntary‑rage automatism than a broad dyscontrol amnesty—preserving public legitimacy and victim respect.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate the Santiago/Chen framework into concrete trial tools? Specifically: (1) propose the core elements a jury must find for a dyscontrol excuse—define “substantial degradation of inhibitory control,” specify that poverty per se is insufficient, require a reactive event signature and absence of planning, and address voluntary intoxication—ideally with sample instruction language; and (2) outline a pretrial Rule 702/Daubert checklist you’d use (neutral court‑appointed experts, required data sources, validity checks) and confirm your preferred burden (clear and convincing?). Would you also confine the excuse to reactive violent offenses, and if so, how would you phrase that gate without inviting mini‑trials on life circumstances?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I largely agree with Dr. Chen: no single test can “time‑stamp” loss of control. The law should demand alignment across mechanism, history, and the moment, and it should do so through a structured, rule‑governed gate. Two points from an evidentiary/administrability vantage.

1) Specificity and temporal fit
- The proposed tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop/Go–No‑Go) are the right neighborhood; WCST is too nonspecific and should be down‑weighted. Even the best inhibition tasks are state‑sensitive and cannot by themselves establish momentary dyscontrol.
- Historic BLLs are probative only if elevated during sensitive developmental windows and coupled with present inhibition deficits. Diurnal or hair cortisol supports chronic stress, not the instant state. These are corroborators, not clinchers.
- The most case‑probative evidence is still event‑level phenomenology (abrupt, affective escalation; disorganization; lack of planning) corroborated by contemporaneous sources (911 audio, video, witness statements).

2) Minimum bundle to reach clear and convincing
I would require all of the following; failure on any one should presumptively defeat the excuse. Limit the doctrine to genuinely reactive violence.

- Event signature: Near‑immediate, provoked escalation; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous descriptions of dissociation or “seeing red”; post‑event disorientation. Prefer objective corroboration (video/dispatch logs).
- Pre‑offense corroboration: Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile or ED notes, sleep disturbance tied to environmental stress). This anchors temporality and counters reverse causation.
- Neurocognitive profile with validity: At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), administered with multiple performance‑validity tests and, ideally, replicated or triangulated. Low‑to‑moderate trait antisociality (e.g., not a predatory profile).
- Clinical linkage: A structured‑diagnostic finding (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptoms plausibly map onto the index event’s triggers and phenomenology. Biological stress markers may corroborate but are not required.
- Objective developmental insult: At least one independently documented exposure likely to impair control systems (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL, repeated or ≥10 once; documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency; well‑supported FASD risk), with a plausible linkage to current deficits.
- Exclusions: No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, and instrumental motives; guard against malingering with stand‑alone and embedded validity tests and collateral consistency.

Scientific and forensic pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress, or litigation stress can depress performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; give weight to pre‑offense records; be wary of single‑session snapshots.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Require multiple validity indices; scrutinize “too bad to be true” profiles; prefer convergence across tasks and sessions and collateral histories.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication should generally defeat the excuse unless the defense proves baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Reverse causation and ecological fallacy: Post‑offense stress can mimic chronic markers; neighborhood‑level deprivation does not prove individual impairment—insist on individual‑level documentation.
- Neuro “seduction”: Treat fMRI/EEG as at most supportive and subject to Daubert limits; avoid over‑interpretation of small effects or exploratory analyses.
- Measurement error and multiple comparisons: Demand pre‑specified batteries, normative references, and full reporting (including non‑significant findings).

Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a standardized proffer; clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Restrict offense domain to reactive violence (and perhaps a narrow class of truly impulsive nonviolent acts); exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcate and give a tailored instruction: deprivation alone is not a defense; the question is whether, at the moment, defendant’s capacity to inhibit was substantially impaired and that impairment was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Finally, much of this same evidence should channel to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance in homicide and to structured mitigation at sentencing when the full excuse is not met. That preserves public legitimacy while honoring Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply.

### Speaker: Host

Dr. Chen, could you crystallize this into a crisp decision rule a trial judge can apply at gatekeeping: the minimal converging bundle that must be present to reach clear-and-convincing that volitional control was substantially degraded at the moment of offense, and the explicit disqualifiers that defeat the claim? Please phrase it as bullet points suitable for a Daubert-style ruling.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

- Over-interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI/EEG are not diagnostic at the individual level; results are highly sensitive to preprocessing choices, motion, and task design, with substantial analytic flexibility and poor test–retest reliability for many paradigms. Admit only as supportive context, never as dispositive.
- Norm/reference issues: Executive tasks and physiological markers require demographically corrected norms (age, sex, education, language, culture). Using inappropriate norms will inflate apparent deficits. Courts should insist on population-appropriate, peer‑reviewed norms and disclosure of scoring corrections.
- Measurement reliability and timing: SSRT and affective inhibition tasks have only moderate test–retest reliability; single‑day salivary cortisol is noisy; hair cortisol is affected by hair treatments and ethnicity; historic BLLs taken years after exposure are weak proxies. Prefer repeated or corroborated measures and documented childhood labs/records over retrospective proxies.
- State contamination: Acute sleep loss, pain, medication changes, or incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions, document sleep (e.g., actigraphy/collateral), and, where feasible, repeat testing to confirm trait‑like deficits.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Require multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance validity tests, cross‑measure consistency, and collateral informants. Be alert to selective “too bad” patterns confined to litigated domains.
- Acute intoxication confounds: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition. Voluntary intoxication should presumptively defeat a dyscontrol excuse unless the defense can show baseline impairment independent of substance effects and that intoxication was not the proximate driver.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑charge stress and learning effects can alter tests. Weight pre‑offense documentation (school/medical/CPS, prior labs) heavily to establish temporality.
- Trait–state misattribution: Low HRV/flattened cortisol reflect chronic load but are not specific to volitional impairment; they should not substitute for event‑level evidence and inhibitory testing.
- Alternative mechanistic explanations: Primary psychosis/mania, TBI, or clear instrumental motives must be ruled out; otherwise the dyscontrol mechanism is not the best explanation.
- Small effects/base‑rate problem: Many exposed individuals show no dyscontrol; population correlations cannot be reverse‑imputed to the person. Convergence across history, mechanism, and moment is essential.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing)
- Event signature: Near‑instant, affective escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized act; no planning/cover‑up; contemporaneous corroboration (witness, audio/video) of dissociation/“saw red”/autonomic arousal.
- Pre‑offense history: Nonforensic records predating the offense documenting episodic reactive dyscontrol (e.g., school IEP/discipline, juvenile MH notes, ED visits), establishing temporality.
- Neurocognitive evidence with validity: ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop) with intact PVTs and either replication or cross‑test convergence; low–moderate psychopathic traits supporting a reactive, not predatory, profile.
- Psychiatric linkage: Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented exposures and mapping plausibly to the index trigger; physiological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol) as supportive but not required.
- Objective developmental insult: Independent documentation of at least one biologically plausible exposure (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, documented FASD risk), consistent with current executive deficits.

Disqualifiers: substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate cause; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; strong instrumental planning; malingering.

Process safeguards
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tied to a pre‑specified checklist; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsych, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Blinding where possible (evaluator not told case theory), standardized testing protocols, and full disclosure of raw data and scoring.
- Emphasize pre‑offense records for temporality; treat imaging as at most supportive.

Bottom line: No single test can “time‑stamp” loss of control, but a tightly specified, convergent bundle—history → mechanism → moment—can justify a dyscontrol excuse in a narrow subset of reactive violent cases.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assuming we adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence, please draft a concise model jury instruction (3–4 sentences) for an RSB‑dyscontrol excuse that: (i) sets a clear‑and‑convincing burden to prove substantial degradation of inhibitory control that substantially caused the offense; (ii) limits applicability to reactive, unplanned conduct; and (iii) categorically excludes cases where voluntary intoxication was the proximate cause. If you would add any other bright‑line exclusion to keep error costs acceptable, include it in the instruction.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Two points from the bench’s perspective: temporal precision is unattainable; administrability is non‑negotiable. No single test will time‑stamp loss of control. But a pre‑specified, convergent bundle can justify putting a tightly cabined dyscontrol excuse to a jury without opening the floodgates.

What I would require before the defense reaches the jury

- Burden and domain
  - Clear and convincing evidence; defense bears the burden.
  - Offense domain limited to reactive interpersonal violence (seconds to minutes after a salient provocation). Presumptive exclusion for planned acquisitive crimes.

- Gatekeeping procedure
  - Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tied to the elements below.
  - Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
  - Notice and standardized documentary proffers (medical labs, CPS, school/IEP, housing/EPA, unemployment records; geocoded residence histories).

- Minimum convergence (“five pillars”), none sufficient alone
  1) Objective exposure history (mechanistic plausibility)
     - Longitudinal deprivation: residence ≥8 of first 18 years in top‑decile Area Deprivation Index tracts with high violent‑crime exposure; plus at least one of: chronic school poverty/underfunding, housing instability/evictions, caregiver unemployment (verified by records).
     - Biological insult during sensitive periods (one required): childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or any ≥10); documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk. These do not prove momentary loss of control but supply a credible pathway.

  2) Pre‑offense dyscontrol documentation (temporality)
     - Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school discipline/IEPs for explosive behavior, juvenile mental health notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits). This reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

  3) Event signature (moment alignment)
     - Acute provocation with near‑immediate escalation; disorganized execution; no luring/staging/cover‑up; contemporaneous witness descriptions of “seeing red,” blanking, marked autonomic arousal. Video/911/body‑cam if available. Evidence of planning or instrumental motive should defeat the excuse.

  4) Neurocognitive profile with validity (mechanism now)
     - Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and reasonable stability across sessions. Include a delay‑discounting measure if available. Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy scores consistent with impulsive (not predatory) aggression.

  5) Psychiatric/stress linkage (clinical plausibility)
     - A DSM‑5 trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established with structured instruments, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, and symptom content that plausibly maps to the index event (triggers, dissociation). Stress biomarkers (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) are supportive, not required.

- Disqualifiers/alternative causes to exclude
  - Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (defeats the excuse).
  - Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time, or clear instrumental motive.
  - Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity indices; watch for “too bad to be true” patterns.

What the science cannot do and how to compensate

- Specificity/temporality limits: Stroop and WCST are nonspecific; downweight them. Stop‑signal and antisaccade are better but sensitive to state (sleep, meds). Hair cortisol is a three‑month stress window; salivary diurnal profiles are noisy. None time‑stamps the instant. The law must rely on alignment across history, mechanism, and the event, anchored by pre‑offense records and contemporaneous observations.

Key pitfalls for courts

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer corroboration or repeat testing.
- Reverse causation: rely heavily on pre‑charge documentation (school, pediatric, environmental records).
- Over‑interpretation of “neuro”: treat fMRI/EEG as inadmissible or strictly supportive unless tied to accepted clinical syndromes; they are not dispositive of volition.
- Resource asymmetry: without funded neutral expertise for indigent defendants, the doctrine will either be unusable or unequally applied.

Jury management and instructions

- Use bifurcation or, at minimum, a specialized instruction clarifying:
  - This is an excuse (not a justification); it does not endorse the act.
  - The question is whether, due to cumulative, verified exposures, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit action was substantially degraded at the moment, and that degradation was a substantial contributing cause.
  - General social disadvantage, without the required convergence, is insufficient.

Disposition

- If excuse found on an involuntary‑rage/automatism theory: NG by reason of involuntariness; then ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, job supports), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.
- For homicides falling short of automatism: channel to MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (manslaughter) with calibrated instructions (“person in the actor’s situation” limited to proven, case‑specific deprivation factors).
- All other cases: RSB belongs at sentencing via validated mitigation frameworks keyed to verified deprivation indicators and biological insults.

Bottom line

Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s cautions are directionally right. If we codify the “five pillars,” keep the offense domain narrow, and insist on neutral expertise and clear‑and‑convincing convergence, courts can honor Hart’s fairness limit without sacrificing administrability or public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Given Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence standards, design the courtroom architecture to make this administrable: (i) what should a pretrial Daubert‑style hearing require (checklist, neutral court experts, offense domain limits), and what precise definition of “substantial volitional impairment” should the court use at that stage; (ii) should the excuse be tried in a bifurcated phase (as with insanity) to reduce prejudice and jury confusion, and if so, propose model limiting instructions; and (iii) draft a short pattern jury instruction for the merits phase that captures the clear‑and‑convincing burden, the need for alignment across history–mechanism–moment, and disqualifiers (planning, voluntary intoxication), while minimizing expressive harm and preventing socio‑economic bias. Please be concrete and include any bright‑line exclusions you think essential to avoid floodgates.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen on the science and with Prof. Santiago on the structure. None of these instruments is time‑stamped to the moment of offense; the law therefore must demand tight convergence across history, mechanism, and the event itself, and cabin the doctrine to the narrow class of reactive, non‑instrumental violence. Here is how I would translate Stage 2 into administrable courtroom gates.

1) Admissibility and burden
- Pretrial Daubert-style hearing; defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden on attribution.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to review both sides’ proffers; standardized testing protocols and performance‑validity checks.
- Limit the excuse to reactive violent offenses (rapid escalation after salient provocation). Presumptive exclusion for planned acquisitive crime and for substantial voluntary intoxication proximate to the act.

2) What evidence can support “substantial volitional impairment” at the time of offense
No single test suffices. Require a converging bundle that, taken together, makes it highly probable the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform at the critical moment (Hart’s fairness limit). I would require all of the following four pillars plus the exclusions:

A. Event‑level signature (mandatory)
- Near‑immediate, affective escalation after a specific trigger; minimal planning; disorganized execution; contemporaneous reports of dissociation/“seeing red”/marked autonomic arousal; ideally corroborated by body‑cam/911 audio/video. Any luring, weapon staging, lying‑in‑wait, or post‑event concealment defeats this pillar.

B. Pre‑offense corroboration of dyscontrol (mandatory)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense reflecting stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile MH notes of dissociation/Intermittent Explosive Disorder, prior ED visits for rage episodes, documented chronic sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive evidence with validity (mandatory)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks directly tied to the mechanism (e.g., Stop‑Signal or Go/No‑Go with reliable SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact effort/performance‑validity indices and either replication or cross‑test convergence. Downweight WCST; include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) and use trait psychopathy measures cautiously to support an impulsive—not predatory—profile.

D. Mechanistic linkage (mandatory, with at least one biological indicator)
- A DSM‑5 trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established by a qualified clinician using structured instruments, with symptom content plausibly mapping the index trigger; and
- At least one objectively documented developmental biological insult that plausibly degrades inhibitory control (e.g., childhood blood‑lead history ≥5 µg/dL, preferably repeated or a prior ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; credible FASD risk). Chronic stress markers (e.g., flattened hair/diurnal cortisol, low resting HF‑HRV) are supportive but not determinative.

E. Exclusions/controls (mandatory)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse; the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures, acute TBI at offense, malingering (multiple PVTs, consistency checks), and strong evidence of instrumental motive.
- Standardize testing conditions (sleep, meds, caffeine) and rely, where possible, on pre‑charge documentation to avoid “forensic artifact” effects of incarceration stress.

If the defense proves A–D and satisfies E by clear and convincing evidence, the attribution meets the threshold. If one pillar is weak (e.g., no usable biomarker), the rest must be exceptionally strong and independently corroborated; fMRI, if offered, is at most supportive.

3) Specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks and stress markers are not temporally precise, but the law routinely infers states of mind circumstantially (e.g., heat of passion, MPC EED). The “event signature” does the temporal work; the tests and biomarkers supply mechanism and plausibility. Used that way, the bundle can justify the inference in a small subset of cases.

4) Pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, legal stress can depress executive performance and cortisol; require standardized protocols and, where feasible, repeat/triangulate; give greater weight to pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: insist on multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; be wary of selective “too bad to be true” deficits.
- Acute intoxication: alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; keep the voluntary‑intoxication bar firm.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and impair testing; hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and longitudinal pediatric/school/CPS/EPA records help.
- Biomarker allure: fMRI/EEG and even hair cortisol have limited specificity and, in the case of hair cortisol, possible ethnic and hair‑treatment confounds. Treat them as corroborative, not dispositive.
- Base‑rate neglect/equality: without funding parity and neutral experts, this will become an “affluence defense.” Courts must ensure resources for indigent defendants.

5) Jury instruction and offense‑domain narrowing
- Provide a patterned instruction: “Substantial impairment of inhibitory control” means that, because of documented environmental insults and resulting deficits, the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to conform his conduct at the time of a sudden provocation; background hardship alone is insufficient; the impairment must be a substantial contributing cause of the act. Clarify that planned or instrumental conduct is outside the doctrine and that voluntary intoxication precludes the excuse.
- Outside this narrow lane, channel evidence to MPC‑style EED in homicide (partial mitigation) or to structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators.

6) Disposition
- Special verdict (e.g., “not guilty by reason of involuntary dyscontrol”) with ESB‑oriented supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment supports), periodic judicial review, and civil‑commitment backstop only where the person remains demonstrably dangerous. Incorporate victim‑safety conditions and victim voice.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 architecture is directionally sound if pared to tasks that target inhibition, anchored in pre‑offense records, and yoked to a strong event‑level signature with firm exclusions. Administered with neutral expertise and a clear‑and‑convincing standard, this will be a once‑in‑a‑while excuse for truly reactive violence—consistent with Hart and Fletcher’s fair‑opportunity limit, and with the institutional need to keep the gates tight.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and equality standpoint, would you make a documented developmental biological insult (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or FASD indicators) a necessary element of a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse, or treat such biomarkers as supportive but not required? Please justify in terms of Daubert reliability and Type I/II error tradeoffs, and say how you’d instruct trial judges at a pretrial gatekeeping hearing to avoid mini‑trials and indigency‑driven disparities.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m largely aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage design and Dr. Chen’s cautions. Stage 2 can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference only when the law’s question—fair opportunity to conform at the moment—meets convergent, nonforensic evidence. I would cabin the doctrine to reactive violence and require a tight, court‑managed bundle before a jury hears it.

Minimum bundle I would require (all five, with no single item sufficient):

1) Event‑level reactive signature
- Near‑instant escalation after a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous witnesses/video/911/bodycam describing “blanking out,” marked autonomic arousal, or dissociation. Any meaningful planning, weapon pre‑positioning, or concealment defeats the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive outbursts, juvenile mental‑health notes, ED visits) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control. This addresses temporality and counters reverse‑causation.

3) Neurocognitive findings with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD impaired (e.g., Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), replicated or cross‑validated, with multiple performance‑validity tests passed. Add a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting). Low–moderate trait psychopathy supports an impulsive—not predatory—profile (used cautiously).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview DSM‑5 diagnosis (PTSD—dissociative subtype or IED) tied to pre‑offense exposures; symptom content plausibly explains triggers/dissociation in the instant act. Physiological corroboration (hair cortisol flattening or low HF‑HRV) is supportive only.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independently documented exposure pre‑dating adolescence (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. Mixed cases require showing baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless separately excused), acute TBI at offense, malingering (multiple PVTs), and strong instrumental motives.
- Testing as early as practicable (30–60 days) with standardized conditions; heavy weight on pre‑charge records to avoid forensic artifact.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police:
- State–trait confounds (sleep loss, acute stress, meds): standardize testing; seek replication or cross‑task coherence.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; scrutinize “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: do not let toxin‑history (lead, FASD) be a backdoor for alcohol/drug intoxication.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance; favor pre‑offense documentation.
- Over‑reading biomarkers: fMRI/EEG are not time‑of‑offense meters; admit only as background science, not determinative proof. Hair cortisol is a coarse 3‑month index; treat as corroboration.

Judicial management to keep the gate tight:
- Written notice and a pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a standardized checklist mirroring the bundle above.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Prohibit “one‑sided” shopping.
- Limit the doctrine to reactive interpersonal violence (and perhaps a narrow band of truly impulsive nonviolent offenses). Presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime and stalking‑type domestic cases.
- Defense bears clear‑and‑convincing proof that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act; special verdict form on those two findings.

Jury instructions/disposition:
- Bifurcate. In the excuse phase, instruct that the question is fair opportunity to comply at the moment, not general hardship. Make clear this is an excuse, not a justification.
- If excused, move to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions with supervision (trauma treatment, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, job supports). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

Bottom line: the proposed batteries and markers are not time stamps; they gain legal traction only when they line up with a compelling reactive event picture and pre‑offense records. With that convergence, and the procedural guardrails above, the doctrine remains both morally defensible and administrable.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, how would you operationalize Dr. Chen’s proposed "convergent bundle" in the courtroom? Please be concrete: (i) a pretrial gatekeeping protocol (what documentary proffer and test results must be shown at a Daubert‑style hearing before the jury hears any RSB‑dyscontrol evidence, and any categorical exclusions such as substantial voluntary intoxication or evidence of instrumental planning); (ii) a short model jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and the clear‑and‑convincing burden, with guidance on weighing event‑level phenomenology versus test results; and (iii) any verdict form or bifurcation tweaks (special interrogatories, lesser‑included options) you’d adopt to preserve jury focus and public legitimacy while avoiding floodgates and disparate application.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Broadly, I’m aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage structure and with Dr. Chen’s cautions. The science can support a dyscontrol excuse only when history, mechanism, and the moment converge; no single test time‑stamps loss of control. The court’s job is gatekeeping and administrability. I would adopt a narrow, rule‑governed approach:

1) Admissibility and weight
- Admissibility: Under Daubert (or Frye), standard neuropsych tasks (Go/No‑Go, stop‑signal with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go/Stroop), validated PTSD/IED instruments, and historic blood‑lead records are admissible in principle. WCST has low mechanism‑specific value here; fMRI should be excluded or, at most, treated as non‑determinative demonstrative evidence due to modest forensic reliability and high prejudice/confusion risk. Hair cortisol is admissible as a chronic stress correlate (with proper foundation and caveats), not as a moment‑of‑offense marker.
- Weight: The court should pre‑screen for probative value tied to inhibitory control and affective reactivity, and exclude global cognitive screens that don’t track the asserted mechanism.

2) Minimum bundle to reach clear‑and‑convincing on Stage 2 (all items required unless noted)
A. Event signature (must have)
- Acute, salient provocation with seconds‑to‑minutes escalation; disorganized conduct; no luring or concealment; contemporaneous indicators of autonomic arousal/dissociation (911/bodycam/witnesses). If there is planning or post‑event instrumental behavior, the excuse should presumptively fail.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (must have)
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school disciplinary/IEP entries for explosive behavior; prior ED/clinic notes for rage/dissociation; sleep disruption) to establish temporality and reduce reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity (must have)
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go; antisaccade error rates; affective Stroop/Go‑No‑Go), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and, ideally, stability across two sessions or cross‑test convergence. Include a choice‑impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available. Downweight WCST; do not treat it as a core marker.

D. Psychiatric linkage (must have)
- DSM‑5 diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) using structured tools, with symptom content and triggers plausibly mapping onto the index event, corroborated by longitudinal records.

E. Objective developmental insult (must have at least one)
- Childhood blood lead level ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated elevations or one ≥10) documented in pediatric/public‑health records; or documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition during sensitive periods; or well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk. These are not time‑of‑offense measures but supply mechanistic plausibility when coupled with C and D.

F. Disqualifiers and exclusions (all must be satisfied)
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; toxicology required where feasible. If substances present, defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication; ordinarily voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse.
- Performance validity intact; no evidence of malingering (multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs).
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, or clear instrumental motives (robbery planning, revenge plotting).
- Trait profile consistent with reactive, not predatory, aggression (e.g., low‑to‑moderate PCL‑R, used cautiously).

This “five pillars plus exclusions” approach is materially the same as Dr. Chen’s, with a judicial emphasis on event‑level proof and pre‑offense documentation.

3) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Executive performance and cortisol are state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, acute legal stress). Standardize testing conditions; prefer repeated or corroborated testing; rely heavily on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple PVTs and check cross‑task consistency; beware selective, “too bad to be true” deficits.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary use should usually defeat a dyscontrol excuse.
- Reverse causation: Post‑offense incarceration and stress can flatten cortisol and depress performance; hair cortisol can help with pre‑offense windows but is confounded by hair treatment/ethnicity; the best antidote is pre‑charge records (pediatric BLLs, school files).
- Base‑rate/reference‑class error: Population links (e.g., adversity to SSRT) don’t establish individual causation; that is why the bundle requires pre‑offense records and event signature.
- Ecological fallacy/culture shopping: Neighborhood‑level deprivation alone is not proof of impairment; insist on individual‑level documentation and neutral experts.
- Over‑reliance on WCST/global IQ: These are weakly tied to the claimed mechanism and can mislead jurors.

4) Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Bifurcated process. Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing with a structured written proffer keyed to the elements above; the court makes explicit findings on each pillar and disqualifier. If the threshold is met, the jury receives a tightly drafted instruction focused on reactive dyscontrol (not societal fault or justification).
- Neutral expertise. Court‑appointed neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental‑health experts to reduce partisanship; ensure indigent funding parity to avoid an equality trap.
- Narrow offense domain. Limit to reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Special verdicts. Ask the jury to find, separately: (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time; (ii) that such degradation was a substantial contributing cause; and (iii) absence of voluntary intoxication as proximate cause. This preserves appellate review and transparency.
- Limiting instruction. Make clear this is an excuse, not a justification; it does not license violence or diminish the victim’s wrong.

5) Disposition
Consistent with my prior view, an excuse finding should channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision (housing relocation, trauma therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous and meet civil criteria. This addresses public‑safety and legitimacy concerns without converting the guilt phase into a policy inquest.

Bottom line: With a convergent bundle of event‑level reactivity, pre‑offense documentation, valid inhibition deficits, a diagnosis that maps to the event, and at least one documented developmental insult—plus strict exclusion of intoxication and malingering—the clear‑and‑convincing standard is workable and the gate can remain narrow.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle as inputs, what would your black‑letter gatekeeping rule and a concise model jury instruction look like to make this administrable and contain error costs? Please specify: (i) the pretrial Daubert standard and required proffer; (ii) the burden and elements the defense must prove; (iii) the offense categories covered/excluded (e.g., reactive violence only; voluntary intoxication bar); and (iv) the short instruction you’d give on “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” that avoids collapsing into general sympathy.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaking as a judge worried about administrability and error costs, I would not treat any single Stage 2 measure as specific or time‑precise enough to prove loss of volitional control at the moment of offense. As Dr. Chen notes, these tools are probative only in convergence. The question for courts is whether a reliably established pattern of impaired inhibition, tied to pre‑offense exposures, aligns with an offense that bears the hallmarks of reactive dyscontrol, and whether obvious alternative drivers have been excluded. If we are to recognize a dyscontrol excuse at guilt, I would require a tight, pre‑specified bundle, a high burden (clear and convincing), and bright‑line disqualifiers.

What is probative, and how to use it
- Event signature (most probative for temporality)
  - Near‑immediate escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; lack of planning/cover‑up; contemporaneous descriptions of “blanking out,” dissociation, autonomic arousal; ideally corroborated by video/911/body‑cam. If there is luring, weapon staging, prior threats, or concealment, the excuse should presumptively fail.
- Pre‑offense documentation (anchors temporality; reduces reverse‑causation)
  - Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound eruptions (school IEPs/discipline, juvenile mental‑health notes, ED visits for rage/dissociation, sleep disruption). Post‑charge testing alone is insufficient.
- Neurocognitive testing (mechanism; not time‑stamped)
  - Valid deficits (≥1.5 SD) on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop); include delay discounting as supportive.
  - Multiple embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Downweight WCST; it lacks specificity.
- Clinical linkage (maps symptoms to the index event)
  - Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom content and triggers that plausibly explain the offense; corroborated by longitudinal records. Biomarkers of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol) are supportive, not determinative.
- Developmental exposure biomarker (supports causal plausibility)
  - Historic BLLs ≥5 µg/dL in childhood (ideally repeated, or a prior ≥10), documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or well‑documented FASD risk, all predating the deficits. These are not momentary indices but strengthen the mechanism claim.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
Require all of the following:
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol; and
2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol; and
3) Neurocognitive inhibition deficits on ≥2 tasks with intact validity indices; and
4) A structured trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis that maps to the event; and
5) At least one independently documented developmental biological insult (e.g., childhood lead, FASD risk, or documented malnutrition/anemia).

Plus disqualifiers/controls:
- Substantial voluntary intoxication proximate to the act defeats the excuse (mitigation only).
- Evidence of instrumental planning or motive defeats the excuse.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures belongs under insanity, not RSB dyscontrol.
- Malingering safeguards failed (invalid performance) defeats the excuse.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; where feasible, repeat; rely on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple PVTs and embedded validity checks; beware selective, “too bad to be true” patterns. Court‑appointed neutral examiners help.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary use generally defeats a dyscontrol excuse at guilt.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑offense stress can alter biomarkers and tests; hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) helps; pre‑charge pediatric/school/CPS/EPA records are best.
- Ecological fallacy/base‑rate neglect: High‑risk environments do not prove individual dyscontrol. Keep the focus on the defendant’s documented history and testing, not population‑level correlations.
- Over‑interpretation of flashy neuroscience: fMRI/EEG lacks individual‑diagnostic specificity; admit, if at all, as background education, not as proof.

Procedural guardrails (to keep the gate narrow and fair)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tied to a structured checklist reflecting the bundle above; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden on (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) its substantial contribution to the act.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; standardized templates for records (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA/HUD, UI; geocoded exposure histories).
- Offense domain limited to reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent outbursts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions: If the gate is met, the jury receives a narrow dyscontrol instruction focused on loss of inhibitory control, not broad societal blame. Otherwise, RSB evidence is channeled to sentencing mitigation.

Evidentiary standard and causation language
- Use “substantial factor” rather than strict but‑for causation for the volitional element; require clear and convincing proof that degraded inhibitory control substantially contributed to the act at the moment it occurred.

Disposition
- If excused, ESB‑oriented noncarceral conditions (trauma therapy, stable housing, nutrition/sleep interventions, relocation from criminogenic contexts, job pipelines) under court supervision; civil commitment only if the person is dangerous and meets mental‑illness criteria.

Bottom line
- The proposed batteries and markers are not specific or temporally precise alone, but a tightly defined, convergent bundle—anchored by event‑level evidence and pre‑offense documentation—can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a small subset of cases. The safeguards above are what make the doctrine governable and preserve public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, would you write Prof. Santiago/Dr. Chen’s dyscontrol gate into a model rule—and if so, how narrowly? Please propose concise model language for (i) a pretrial gatekeeping standard (burden, notice, neutral experts, sources of proof), (ii) the offense domain (e.g., reactive violence only; explicit exclusion of planned acquisitive crimes and voluntary intoxication), and (iii) the jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control.” Also, weigh in on whether to make a developmental biological insult (e.g., childhood lead) a required element versus supportive evidence, given equality/access concerns.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Two points at the outset. First, courts are in the “fair opportunity” business, not the lab. We need administrable gates that let truly dyscontrol cases through without turning every hard life into an excuse. Second, timing and mechanism have to line up: a cumulative exposure story plus a moment-of-offense signature.

Admissibility and weight under Daubert/Frye
- Stronger, generally accepted items: historic childhood blood‑lead levels from medical records; CPS/medical documentation of severe early adversity; school/juvenile records evidencing longstanding impulse dyscontrol; well‑validated neurocognitive inhibition tasks with performance‑validity checks.
- Supportive but not determinative: hair/diurnal cortisol (noisy, state‑sensitive); heart‑rate variability; actigraphy/sleep clinic data. Admit with caution and limiting instructions.
- I would not rest causation on fMRI/EEG; in the courtroom these are still better as didactic context than proof of volitional failure.
- WCST has low specificity to inhibition; downweight. Prefer stop‑signal (SSRT), Go/No‑Go (including affective variants), antisaccade, flanker, delay‑discounting—administered with multiple PVTs and, where feasible, repeat testing.
- PCL‑R should not be overused; if used, it’s to rule out a predatory profile, not to prove dyscontrol.

Minimum convergence to meet clear and convincing
I would require all five pillars below; none suffices alone:

1) Reactive event signature
- Provocation to act within seconds/minutes; disorganized execution; no luring, weapon staging, or concealment; contemporaneous witness/video/911 descriptions of “blanking out,” “seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal. The presence of planning or instrumental follow‑through should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the charge: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, ER visits for rage episodes, documented chronic sleep disruption. This addresses temporality and avoids reverse‑causation from the litigation environment.

3) Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and affective Go/No‑Go or antisaccade), with intact effort indices (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs) and stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Add a choice‑impulsivity measure (delay discounting) where possible.

4) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented exposures and with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index act. Biological stress markers (flattened hair/diurnal cortisol) are corroborative only.

5) Objective developmental insult(s)
- At least one independent, pre‑existing biological or environmental insult consistent with impaired prefrontal control: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or any ≥10), early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or well‑documented FASD risk. Geocoded residence linked to lead abatement orders or similar environmental hazards is probative.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania/TBI at the time of offense unless proceeding under a different doctrine.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral informants; beware “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles.
- State–trait confounds: standardize testing (sleep, caffeine, meds); prefer early testing (30–60 days) and triangulate with pre‑offense records.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and depress test performance; rely on pre‑charge documentation to anchor claims.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and equity)
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with a structured proffer tied to the pillars above; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses (and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts). Planned acquisitive crime is out.
- Notice and standardized templates for documentary proof (medical labs, CPS/school records, HUD/EPA orders, unemployment records, geocoded histories).
- Bifurcation and a tailored jury instruction: the question is whether, because of severe environmental deprivation, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate impulse was substantially impaired and that impairment was a substantial factor in the act.
- Rule 403 vigilance: keep junk science and cumulative trauma testimony from overwhelming the trial; use limiting instructions to cabin what the evidence can prove.

Disposition
Where the excuse is found, I favor ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation from criminogenic areas, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment pipelines). Civil commitment should be available only if the person remains demonstrably dangerous and meets mental‑health criteria.

Why this stays narrow
Requiring (1) a reactive event, (2) pre‑offense dyscontrol records, (3) validated inhibition deficits, (4) a diagnosis mapping to the event, and (5) at least one documented developmental insult—plus exclusions for intoxication and planning—will confine the excuse to a small, top‑tail subset. That respects Hart’s fairness limit and Prof. Watkins’s expressive concerns, and addresses Ms. Whitford’s administrability/victim‑protection worries.

Finally, two cautions from the bench:
- Do not let “societal fault” swallow guilt. Apportionment belongs at sentencing via validated mitigation factors (chronic unemployment, lead, severe ACEs), not at liability except in this tightly defined dyscontrol lane.
- Keep imaging glamorous but peripheral. Courts should prefer sturdy, contemporaneous records and well‑validated behavioral assays over colorful scans that suggest more precision than they deliver.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, suppose a legislature codifies a narrow RSB–dyscontrol excuse. What precise gatekeeping architecture would you write into statute or rule? Please specify: (1) burden and standard (e.g., clear‑and‑convincing); (2) a required pretrial Daubert‑style hearing and whether to mandate court‑appointed neutral experts; (3) admissible vs. out‑of‑bounds evidence categories (e.g., neurocognitive tasks with validity checks; childhood BLLs; hair cortisol; fMRI; self‑report scales); (4) categorical disqualifiers (voluntary intoxication, instrumental/planned crimes); (5) offense classes to which the excuse is available; and (6) model jury‑instruction language to confine the ultimate question to “substantial impairment of inhibitory control causing a reactive, not instrumental, act.” Keep it concrete—what would you actually put on paper to keep juries focused and the floodgates closed while honoring Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery: I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage design and with Dr. Chen’s cautions. Stage 2 is where courts can lose control if we aren’t exacting. As a matter of evidentiary law and administrability:

- None of the proposed tests or biomarkers is time‑stamped to the moment of offense. They can support an inference of reactive dyscontrol only as part of a convergent bundle that ties mechanism, history, and event together.
- The right posture is a rigorous pretrial gate (Daubert‑style) with court‑appointed neutral experts and a clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense, limited to reactive violent offenses.

Are the proposed tools specific and temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive batteries: Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go (SSRT) and antisaccade tasks are the most probative for inhibitory control; Stroop/affective Stroop adds some weight; WCST is comparatively nonspecific and should be down‑weighted or replaced with flanker/affective inhibition tasks. All require multiple performance‑validity checks and, ideally, replication or cross‑task convergence. They assess trait‑like capacity with state noise, not momentary impairment.
- Stress markers: Historic childhood BLLs, documented FASD risk, and early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition are probative of developmental injury to control systems; they are not moment‑specific but bolster plausibility when paired with current deficits. Diurnal or hair cortisol reflects chronic load, not instant loss of control; use only as supportive context.
- Neuroimaging (fMRI/EEG): High risk of juror over‑weighting; at most supportive and rarely necessary to meet the threshold.

Minimum bundle I would require to reach clear and convincing
All of A–D, plus E or F; and none of the disqualifiers present:

A) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate response to salient provocation; minimal planning; disorganized execution; contemporaneous corroboration (witness, video, 911/body‑cam) of “blanking,” “seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal. Evidence of luring, pre‑positioning, concealment, or instrumental motive should presumptively defeat the excuse.

B) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline noting explosive outbursts, prior ED/juvenile notes of dissociation/IED, sleep disruption documented). This is key for temporality and to blunt reverse‑causation concerns.

C) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below demographically corrected norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indices and either replication across sessions or cross‑task convergence. Include an impulsive choice measure (delay discounting) if available. Low/moderate psychopathy trait scores to support a reactive profile.

D) Psychiatric linkage mapping to the event
- Structured clinical diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to documented exposures and with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index event. Physiologic corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol) may support but is not required.

E) Objective developmental exposure biomarker (preferably mandatory)
- Childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (ideally repeated, or a prior ≥10), documented FASD risk, or verified early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency during sensitive periods, contemporaneous with Stage 1 deprivation—independent of litigation.

F) Alternatively, a robust, independent physiological marker of impaired affect regulation
- Low resting high‑frequency HRV and heightened threat‑potentiated startle, if competently obtained; supportive but I would not accept this in lieu of E unless exceptionally strong and paired with C and D.

Disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver (alcohol/stimulants) defeats the excuse absent extraordinary evidence that baseline dyscontrol—not intoxication—substantially caused the act.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at offense; strong instrumental motive; malingering (failed PVTs or “too bad to be true” patterns).
- Testing conducted under confounded states (acute sleep deprivation, medication changes) without standardization/replication.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Executive performance and cortisol are state‑sensitive. Standardize testing (sleep, caffeine, meds), use demographically corrected norms, and favor pre‑offense records and replicated findings.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; cross‑check with collateral sources; appoint neutral examiners.
- Acute intoxication: Keep a bright‑line presumption against the excuse where intoxication plausibly explains the conduct.
- Reverse causation and forensic artifact: Post‑charge stress and incarceration can flatten cortisol and depress cognition. Weight historic medical/school/CPS/EPA data and pre‑charge documentation more heavily than post‑charge testing.
- Neuro‑glamour: Exclude or strictly cabin fMRI/EEG; Daubert factors (known error rates, standards, peer review, general acceptance) should be rigorously applied.
- Cultural/measurement bias: Ensure neuropsych norms appropriate to language, education, and cultural background; avoid misattributing culturally mediated test performance to dyscontrol.

Process safeguards and offense limits
- Pretrial proffer and Daubert hearing keyed to the elements above; clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Confine the excuse to genuinely reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Use bifurcation/special interrogatories to keep juror focus: guilt elements first, then a discrete excuse finding under tight instructions.

Bottom line
As tightened above, Stage 2 can be made workable: require the event‑level signature plus pre‑offense corroboration, neurocognitive deficits with validity, a mapped psychiatric diagnosis, and at least one objective developmental exposure marker—with intoxication and instrumental conduct as defeaters. That convergence will keep the gate narrow, align with Hart’s “fair opportunity” limit, and maintain public legitimacy. For cases that fall short, channel RSB to structured sentencing mitigation (using verified deprivation/toxin indicators) or, in homicide, to MPC‑style EED.

### Speaker: Host

From an evidentiary gatekeeping perspective, do Prof. Santiago’s and Dr. Chen’s proposed measures (SSRT/Go–No-Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop; hair/diurnal cortisol; childhood blood‑lead levels; ACEs/CPS and school records; PCL‑R) satisfy Rule 702/Daubert reliability and “fit” to prove substantial volitional impairment at the time of offense? Please be concrete: (1) which categories you would admit, which you would exclude or tightly cabin (and why—methodological reliability, relevance to moment‑of‑offense, undue prejudice/confusion); (2) any pretrial orders you’d issue to standardize the proof (neutral experts, testing protocols, timing, validity checks); and (3) a short model jury instruction you’d use to focus the panel on impairment “at the moment,” minimizing moral overreach and mini‑trials on poverty writ large.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Two framing points from the bench. First, Stage 2 cannot deliver time-stamped loss of control; what it can deliver, at best, is a highly corroborated inference that inhibitory control was substantially degraded when the act occurred. Second, if we are to keep faith with Hart’s “fair opportunity to conform” constraint and preserve administrability, the attribution showing must be rule‑governed, convergent, and tightly cabined to reactive violence. With that in mind:

1) Are the proposed tools specific and temporally sensitive enough?
- Neurocognitive batteries: Useful only as part of a convergent package. Stop‑Signal/Go‑No‑Go and antisaccade tasks are the most on‑point for inhibitory control; Stroop and WCST are weakly specific to the mechanism and should be down‑weighted. Any such testing is state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation) and susceptible to malingering; multiple performance‑validity tests and, ideally, re‑testing are nonnegotiable.
- Stress/insult markers: Childhood blood lead levels (especially repeated elevations, or a spike ≥10 µg/dL during early childhood) and documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency are probative of developmental injury to control systems, but not moment‑to‑moment indices. Diurnal cortisol is noisy; hair cortisol (prior 3 months) is a better chronic‑load proxy but still nonspecific. These are supporting actors, not leads.
- Bottom line: No single measure suffices. The only way to approach clear‑and‑convincing is to align mechanism (developmental insult + current deficits), pre‑offense history, and the event’s reactive signature, while excluding better explanations.

2) Minimum bundle I would require (all five pillars; each independently corroborated)
A. Event‑level reactive signature
- Near‑immediate escalation in response to a salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of preparatory acts (luring, weapon staging) or concealment; contemporaneous evidence (video/body‑cam/911 audio/witness) of dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”) or marked autonomic arousal. Any credible evidence of planning or instrumental motive should presumptively defeat the excuse (the proper home then is MPC EED mitigation or sentencing).

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, documented chronic sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity safeguards
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., Stop‑Signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), plus a delay‑discounting or similar impulsive choice measure; intact embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity tests; stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence. Low–moderate psychopathic trait scores to support an impulsive, not predatory, profile.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the index trigger and response. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol profile) is supportive but not required.

E. Objective developmental insult
- At least one independently documented exposure consistent with the mechanism (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk), with a plausible dose‑response link to current executive deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Alternative causes excluded: primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, malingering (multiple PVTs), or clear instrumental motives.
- Equity in proof: heavy reliance on pre‑charge records; post‑charge testing alone is insufficient.

3) Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, withdrawal, legal stress, meds can depress performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions and, where feasible, repeat; give weight to pre‑offense documentation.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Require multiple validity measures and consistency across time and sources; beware “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles or selective task failure.
- Acute intoxication: Don’t let historic toxin exposure be confused with same‑day voluntary intoxication effects.
- Reverse causation: Incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and impair testing; hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) and old medical/school records help.
- Neuro‑“glamour”: fMRI/EEG should be treated, at most, as corroborative; exclude unless methods are pre‑specified, peer‑accepted, and interpreted by neutral experts; never treat a colorful image as causal proof.
- Norms and bias: Ensure tests use appropriate demographic norms; avoid overreliance on PCL‑R; appoint neutral experts; resource indigent defendants or the doctrine will be inequitable.

4) Procedural guardrails for administrability and legitimacy
- Narrow offense domain: limit to affective/reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden and standard: defense must prove (i) substantially degraded inhibitory control and (ii) that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act, by clear and convincing evidence.
- Gatekeeping: pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tied to a standardized proffer template tracking the five pillars; use court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Bifurcation and instructions: bifurcate guilt/excuse; use specialized instructions emphasizing that this is not a “bad background” defense, not a license for anger, and turns on lack of fair opportunity to conform at the moment, not character.
- Disposition: if excused, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, safe housing relocation, sleep/nutrition, job pipelines), with civil commitment reserved for those meeting statutory dangerousness/mental illness criteria; periodic judicial review; victim input.

If we hold to these elements, we respect Hart’s fairness limit, avoid Fletcher’s concern about unbounded excuses, and keep the gate tight enough to avert floodgates. Most cases with deprivation will not meet this bundle; those rare cases that do are precisely the ones in which full condemnation would outstrip culpability.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage screen and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as the scientific backbone, what would your administrable gatekeeping and instruction package look like? Please sketch (i) a pretrial RSB–dyscontrol Daubert-style hearing standard (burden, neutral experts, required categories of proof, categorical exclusions like voluntary intoxication), and (ii) a concise model jury instruction limited to reactive violence that captures “substantial impairment of inhibitory control causally linked to cumulative RSB,” including the verdict form you’d use (e.g., full acquittal with ESB disposition eligibility). Also note the key error-cost tradeoffs you’re trying to control for.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

Bottom line: none of the proposed measures (Stroop, WCST, stop‑signal, cortisol, historic BLLs) is, standing alone, either specific or time‑precise enough to establish loss of volitional control at the moment of the offense. Used as a convergent bundle, anchored by the event’s “reactive” signature and pre‑offense documentation, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference in a narrow class of cases. The gate must be tight and focused on “fit” (Rule 702/Daubert): do these data speak to inhibitory control in this defendant at this time?

On the tools themselves
- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go: most probative of motor inhibition (with a well‑estimated SSRT), but state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation). Must include performance‑validity testing and, ideally, a re‑test.
- Stroop: useful part of a battery; limited specificity to the mechanism at issue.
- WCST: weakest of the three for inhibition; I would downweight it and prefer antisaccade, flanker, and affective inhibition tasks (emotional Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop).
- Cortisol: single‑day salivary profiles are noisy; hair cortisol offers a 2–3 month window for chronic load but is nonspecific and confounded by hair treatment/ethnicity.
- Historic BLLs: strengthen developmental plausibility (especially repeated ≥5 µg/dL or any ≥10 µg/dL in early childhood) but do not time‑stamp the offense.
- fMRI: I would not rely on it for adjudication; at most, it is weakly supportive background.

What I would require (clear and convincing) before letting a dyscontrol excuse go to a jury
All of the following, with no single element sufficient:

1) Event‑level reactive signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of planning/cover‑up; contemporaneous evidence (video/911/body‑cam/witness) of “blanking,” “seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal; rapid cessation once the trigger abates.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school discipline/IEPs for explosive episodes; juvenile or ED notes referencing dissociation/IED; sleep disruption tied to neighborhood stress). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity and replication
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity indices passed and stability across a second session or cross‑test convergence; include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting). Low–moderate psychopathic traits to support an impulsive, not predatory, pattern.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps onto the index event
- Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response in the offense. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) is supportive but not essential.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independently documented early‑life biological insult (historic BLLs, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition markers, or well‑documented FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to current executive deficits.

6) Exclusions/negative controls
- Voluntary intoxication not the proximate driver (a meaningful BAC or stimulant level should presumptively defeat the excuse absent strong proof of baseline dyscontrol sufficient to produce the act regardless).
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania, acute TBI at the time of offense, and clear instrumental motives (luring, weapon staging, concealment).
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral informants.

Key scientific/legal pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, meds can degrade performance and flatten cortisol; standardize and, where feasible, re‑test; lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: “too bad to be true” profiles; selective impairments; require validity testing and collateral corroboration.
- Acute intoxication: do not let historic “toxin” histories blur the line with self‑induced intoxication at the offense.
- Base‑rate neglect/ecological validity: many with these deficits do not offend reactively; do not over‑infer from trait‑like findings to the momentary loss of control.
- Overclaiming by experts: cabin testimony to accepted measures, known error rates, and “fit”; prohibit “ultimate issue” conclusions about legal responsibility.

Procedural guardrails (administrability/error‑costs)
- Pretrial Daubert hearing with a structured proffer addressing each element above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Standardized templates for documentary proof (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA, UI records; geocoded exposure histories); testing protocols with repeat or cross‑validation.
- Offense domain narrowed to truly reactive violence; presumptive exclusion for planned acquisitive crimes.
- Clear jury instructions (bifurcated if feasible) clarifying that this is an excuse (not a justification), unavailable where voluntary intoxication or planning drove the act.

Disposition
- If established, channel to the narrow lanes I’ve endorsed: involuntary‑rage automatism‑type excuse for tightly defined reactive cases, MPC‑style EED in homicide, and otherwise to sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/toxin indicators. Pair excusal with ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions or civil commitment where dangerousness is shown.

With these constraints, the science can be used responsibly: it won’t time‑stamp “no control” to the second, but aligned history, mechanism, and moment can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a small fraction of cases without opening the floodgates.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Prof. Santiago’s and Dr. Chen’s proposals into a concrete courtroom blueprint? Specifically: (1) what would you require at a Daubert/Frye hearing as a minimum admissibility proffer (records, test batteries, biomarkers, collateral sources) before the jury ever hears an RSB–dyscontrol claim; (2) what burden and timing (clear and convincing? pretrial only?) would you impose to avoid mini‑trials; and (3) draft the core jury instruction you’d give on “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” that cleanly distinguishes reactive dyscontrol from instrumental aggression and addresses voluntary intoxication. Please be precise about gatekeeping criteria and any categorical exclusions you’d adopt to keep this administrable and fair.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I largely agree with Dr. Chen’s bottom line. None of these instruments can time‑stamp loss of control to the moment. Courts should not pretend they can. The legal question is Hart’s: was there a fair opportunity to comply? That can be answered—rarely—by converging, preponderantly objective evidence that (i) the defendant is the sort of person whose inhibitory control has been degraded by identifiable insults, and (ii) the index event bears the reactive, unplanned signature of that degradation.

Specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the most probative for inhibition; Stroop and WCST are supportive at best and easily confounded by education and fatigue. Use affective variants (emotional Go–No‑Go/Stroop) given affect‑triggered assaults.
- Stress/toxin markers: Hair cortisol (3‑month window) and historic childhood BLLs (developmental insult) are probative of mechanism, not moment. Single‑day salivary cortisol is too noisy. Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition and verified sleep disruption are supportive.
- Imaging (fMRI/EEG): admissible, if at all, only as pedagogical corroboration; not specific enough to bear weight.

Minimum bundle to meet clear‑and‑convincing
I would require all five pillars below; no single item suffices:

1) Event signature (reactive, not instrumental)
- Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of luring/planning/concealment; contemporaneous witnesses/video/911 describing “saw red,” dissociation, autonomic arousal. Any credible evidence of staging or goal‑directed planning should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol and exposure
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound explosions (school IEPs/discipline, juvenile MH notes, ED visits), and objective exposure history (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated—or documented FASD risk; malnutrition/IDA; verified chronic sleep disruption from environmental conditions). This addresses temporality and avoids “litigation‑generated” profiles.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity safeguards
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), plus a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting), all with multiple stand‑alone and embedded performance‑validity tests clean; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Trait profile consistent with reactive—not predatory—aggression (e.g., low‑moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored in the documented exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index event. Chronic stress physiology (flattened hair‑cortisol slope) is supportive but not required.

5) Exclusions/controls satisfied
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; no primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; no credible malingering (multiple PVTs, raw data disclosure, collateral consistency); no strong instrumental motive. Negative‑control evidence (e.g., sibling without the exposure profile) is probative where available.

Scientific pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance/flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions, repeat when feasible, and lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple PVTs, replicate or cross‑validate results, compel disclosure of raw data to the court’s neutral expert.
- Intoxication: alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; treat voluntary intoxication as a bar absent de minimis use.
- Reverse causation: post‑arrest stress can mimic chronic patterns; hair cortisol and pre‑charge documentation mitigate this.
- Test bias/education/language: use demographically corrected norms, nonverbal tasks, bilingual assessors where appropriate.
- Dueling experts/over‑interpretation: limit to well‑validated tasks; downweight WCST/Stroop standing alone; treat imaging with great caution.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)
- Daubert‑style pretrial hearing keyed to a standardized checklist reflecting the five pillars; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health) with access to raw data.
- Offense domain: confine to affective/reactive violent offenses (and the rare truly impulsive nonviolent act); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Jury instruction that “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” means loss of a fair opportunity to conform at the time of the act; special verdict on the excuse.
- If the bundle falls short, channel the same evidence to MPC‑style EED in homicide or to structured sentencing mitigation.

Disposition
Where the excuse is found, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma therapy, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pathways) under close court supervision; civil commitment only for those dangerous and mentally ill. This respects victims’ safety and public legitimacy without treating RSB as a justification.

With these gates, only a narrow band of cases—where mechanism, history, and moment align—should pass. That is the right place for a dyscontrol excuse to live.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle as the scientific gate, how would you translate this into courtroom architecture? Specifically: (1) What Daubert-style admissibility checklist and pretrial procedures would you require (e.g., neutral court-appointed experts, standardized documentary proffers) to keep juries from being swamped? (2) What offense domain and burden would you adopt (reactive violence only; clear-and-convincing by the defense; voluntary intoxication as a per se bar)? (3) How would you instruct juries to link Stage 1 exposures to Stage 2 event-level dyscontrol without overweighing sympathy? If you can, sketch concrete instruction elements and note any bifurcation you would require.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Building on Dr. Chen’s science and Prof. Santiago’s framework, here is how I would translate Stage 2 into judicially usable gates, with a premium on specificity, timing, and administrability.

1) What the court should require (clear and convincing; all prongs)
- Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
  - Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; no luring, staging, or concealment; disorganized execution; contemporaneous indicia of autonomic arousal or dissociation (video/911/body‑cam, witness accounts).
- Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (non‑forensic)
  - School/juvenile/medical records predating the charge showing stimulus‑bound rages, dissociation, sleep disruption, or prior ED visits consistent with explosive reactivity; not crafted for litigation.
- Neurocognitive evidence with validity
  - At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on tasks tied to motor/affective inhibition (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go/antisaccade/affective Stroop), with:
    - Multiple performance‑validity tests passed (embedded and stand‑alone),
    - Stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence,
    - Norms appropriate for age, education, and culture/language.
  - Downweight WCST; it is nonspecific. Do not let a single Stroop carry the day.
- Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
  - Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to Stage‑1 exposures; symptom triggers plausibly align with the instant offense. Biological corroboration (e.g., hair/diurnal cortisol flattening) is supportive, not determinative.
- Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
  - Independent records of at least one: childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (better if repeated or any ≥10), FASD‑risk documentation, or iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive windows; ideally a dose–response story (higher exposure correlates with worse inhibition).

And the following disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Exclude primary psychosis/mania (unless a different doctrine is invoked), acute TBI at the offense, or evidence of instrumental motive.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, replication/consistency, collateral informants; be wary of “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Timing: testing as early as practicable (within ~60–90 days) plus reliance on pre‑offense records to avoid reverse‑causation artifacts from incarceration stress.

2) What the court should be most alert to (scientific pitfalls)
- State–trait confounds: Sleep loss, acute stress, meds can depress test performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; replicate or corroborate with pre‑offense records/actigraphy.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Require multi‑method validity checks and consistency across tasks/sessions.
- Acute intoxication: Do not conflate lead/FASD history with alcohol/stimulant effects at the moment.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Hair cortisol offers a pre‑offense window; lean heavily on records created before arrest.
- Over‑interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI/EEG are not diagnostic of legal dyscontrol; admit only as supportive and only from qualified experts following validated paradigms.
- Norming/measurement bias: Use culturally and educationally appropriate norms; consider language proficiency; avoid over‑pathologizing low SES test profiles.
- Base‑rate neglect/equifinality: Many with adverse profiles do not offend; adverse biology increases risk but does not prove momentary loss of control—hence the insistence on the event signature and pre‑offense history.
- Cherry‑picking/multiple comparisons: Require a pre‑specified battery or court‑approved protocol to reduce p‑hacking and selective reporting.
- PCL‑R misuse: Treat trait measures cautiously; use to distinguish reactive from predatory patterns, not to brand character.

3) Gatekeeping mechanics to keep it governable and fair
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with a structured checklist tied to the elements above; require defense to proffer documentary exhibits (BLL labs, CPS/school/housing/EPA/UI records) and specify the test battery in advance.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; equal funding for indigent defendants.
- Offense limitation: confine the excuse to genuinely reactive violent offenses (and the rare truly impulsive nonviolent act); planned acquisitive crime presumptively excluded.
- Jury instructions (specialized)
  - Make clear that adversity alone is not an excuse.
  - Define “substantial impairment of volitional control” as a marked, situationally triggered inability to inhibit an immediate aggressive response, and require the jury to find both (i) such impairment and (ii) that it was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
  - Caution against equating dissatisfying life conditions with legal dyscontrol; remind that voluntary intoxication defeats the claim.

4) Minimum convergence I would deem “clear and convincing”
- All five pillars above present (event signature, pre‑offense documentation, valid inhibition deficits on ≥2 tasks, diagnosis mapping to the event, and at least one objective developmental insult), plus no disqualifiers.
- Neutral expert concurrence that the pattern is more consistent with reactive dyscontrol than alternative explanations.
- If any pillar is missing (e.g., no developmental biomarker), the showing would have to be extraordinarily strong on the remaining pillars (e.g., impeccable pre‑offense documentation and replicated, sizeable inhibition deficits).

Bottom line
None of these tools time‑stamp control failure. But when mechanism (documented developmental insult and chronic stress), trait‑level impairment (well‑validated neurocognitive deficits), and moment (reactive, disorganized event with contemporaneous indicators) line up—and obvious alternatives are excluded—the inference that the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply is strong enough to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow band of cases. That is the right moral limit (Hart) and a workable institutional limit if we hold parties to pre‑specified protocols, neutral expertise, and tight offense and evidentiary boundaries.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence as the evidentiary backbone with a clear‑and‑convincing burden, could you propose a succinct model jury instruction for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse that: (i) defines “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” at the time of the offense; (ii) explains “substantial contributing cause” in this context; (iii) delineates the types of evidence jurors may weigh (and how to discount voluntary intoxication); and (iv) uses a special verdict form, if you think appropriate? Please draft the instruction and, if you favor it, the verdict questions—tight enough to avoid a “trial by zip code,” but precise enough to guide lay factfinders.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

Big picture. I find Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage design sound in principle and, with Dr. Chen’s cautions, administrable if we keep the domain narrow (reactive violence), the burden high (clear and convincing), and the gate formal (pretrial Daubert hearing with neutral experts). None of the proposed measures can timestamp loss of control; the law should demand convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment, and treat any single metric as supportive only.

Minimum bundle I would require (all five; failure on any defeats the excuse)

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Acute provocation-to-act latency in seconds/minutes; disorganized execution; no luring or concealment; contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam/witness) of dissociation or autonomic arousal. Any substantive planning, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental behavior presumptively defeats the defense.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (nonforensic)
- School/juvenile/medical/CPS records predating the offense showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., explosive outbursts, dissociation, sleep disruption) or special education/IEPs for impulse regulation; avoids reverse‑causation artifacts.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity and specificity
- Within 30–90 days, two independent inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact effort indices (multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs) and either stability on retest or cross‑test convergence. Downweight WCST; include delay discounting as ancillary. Low–moderate PCL‑R or equivalent trait profile to support impulsive, not predatory, aggression.

4) Psychiatric/physiologic linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview DSM‑5 diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and response. Physiologic corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol profile) is supportive, not required.

5) Objective developmental biological insult
- Independent records of at least one: childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or any ≥10), documented IDA/malnutrition during sensitive periods, or prenatal alcohol exposure/FASD risk; those exposures must plausibly contribute to current executive deficits. These are not momentary gauges but raise mechanistic plausibility when paired with Item 3.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances present, defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, cross‑source consistency, avoidance of “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania, acute TBI at the time, or clear instrumental motive.
- Timing and replication: standardize sleep/meds/caffeine; repeat or corroborate testing; lean heavily on pre‑offense records.

On specific tools
- Stop‑signal and antisaccade are the most probative for inhibition; Stroop (especially affective variants) is helpful but nonspecific; WCST should not carry weight for inhibition per se.
- Hair cortisol offers a better chronic stress window than single‑day diurnal salivary curves but is noisy; use cautiously.
- Historic BLLs are historically probative, not proximate; they should never be the centerpiece.
- I would not admit fMRI/EEG for case‑level attribution beyond limited corroboration; the Daubert factors (error rates, standards, general acceptance for forensic inference) weigh against them.

Pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds (acute sleep loss, legal stress, meds) depressing test performance; standardize and, where possible, retest.
- Reverse causation (post‑arrest stress flattening cortisol); prefer pre‑charge documentation and hair cortisol segments.
- Ecological fallacy: neighborhood deprivation proves risk, not individual impairment; that’s why Items 2–5 are all required.
- Data quality: geocoding errors; unreliable lab assays; chain of custody for medical/environmental records.
- Inequality and “culture shopping”: appoint neutral experts; provide funding parity; require standardized documentary templates.
- Racialized application: keep criteria objective and published; track outcomes.

Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial RSB‑dyscontrol hearing (Daubert‑style) with court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden on each element.
- Offense domain limited to affective/reactive violent offenses; presumptive exclusion of planned acquisitive crimes.
- Strict notice and proffer requirements; protective orders for sensitive records.

Jury instruction (sketch)
- The defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence that, because of cumulative environmental deprivation and its biological/psychological sequelae, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an impulsive violent response to a provoking stimulus was substantially impaired at the time of the act. Ordinary anger, grief, or frustration does not suffice. If you find the act was planned, instrumental, or primarily driven by voluntary intoxication, you must reject the defense.

Dispositions
- If established, release to ESB‑oriented, court‑supervised conditions (housing relocation, trauma‑focused therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, job placement); secure civil commitment only if the person remains demonstrably dangerous under applicable standards. Incorporate victims’ input and regular judicial review.

Where I would cabin the doctrine
- Treat this as an automatism‑adjacent excuse for a small class of reflexive violence; in the larger run of hard cases, use MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance (homicide mitigation) or structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators. I would not endorse “societal fault” apportionment at guilt.

This package keeps faith with Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply—while managing error costs and protecting public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume a jurisdiction adopts a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the lines sketched by Prof. Santiago and Dr. Chen. Focusing on administrability, could you propose concrete model jury instructions and a special verdict form for this excuse that: (i) cabin it to reactive, unplanned violent offenses; (ii) require the defense to prove by clear and convincing evidence both substantial degradation of inhibitory control and that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act; (iii) explicitly exclude voluntary intoxication as a proximate cause; and (iv) direct the jury to return to ordinary culpability if any element is not met? Please draft the operative instruction text and the verdict questions you’d put to the jury so trial judges have a rule-governed template.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge’s assessment

Big picture. Stage 2 is where error costs spike. None of the proposed instruments time‑stamps volitional failure; most are trait‑leaning and state‑contaminable. So, as Dr. Chen noted, the only safe route is convergent proof that (i) this was a reactive, provocation‑bound episode and (ii) the defendant carried pre‑existing inhibitory vulnerabilities plausibly traceable to documented exposures. Event‑level corroboration and pre‑offense records must do the heaviest lifting; labs and tests are supportive.

Are the tools specific/temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive tasks. Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go and antisaccade are the best of an imperfect lot for inhibition; Stroop and WCST add breadth but are not specific to dyscontrol. All are vulnerable to sleep, medications, motivation, and coaching; hence performance‑validity testing and, where possible, re‑testing are essential.
- Stress markers. Childhood blood lead levels (BLLs) and other developmental insults are probative of mechanism (prefrontal vulnerability), not of momentary state. Hair cortisol can index chronic load over months; single‑day salivary profiles are noisy. Treat these as plausibility enhancers, not proximate‑cause proof.

Minimum converging bundle (clear and convincing)
I would not submit a dyscontrol instruction absent all of the following “must‑haves,” with the “supportive” items treated as add‑ons only:

Must‑haves
1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/preparation/concealment.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (ideally video/911/body‑cam or multiple witnesses) of dissociation/“saw red”/marked autonomic arousal.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile MH notes of dissociation/IED episodes, prior ER visits for rage), establishing temporality.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop).
- At least two performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) intact; reasonable stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and phenomenology of the offense; collateral corroboration (family/school/medical).

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independently documented exposure preceding the deficits (one or more): repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (or a prior ≥10), documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia, or credible FASD risk; plus evidence connecting exposure timing to current impairments.

6) Exclusions and negative controls
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (if substances present, defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication).
- No strong instrumental motive; no evidence of planning.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI as better explanations (unless being pursued under a different doctrine).
- Personality profile consistent with impulsive/reactive rather than predatory aggression (use PCL‑R cautiously; low–moderate range supports but is not dispositive).

Supportive (not required)
- Hair cortisol indicating blunted diurnal pattern; low resting high‑frequency HRV; heightened threat‑potentiated startle. Helpful if well‑measured, but not gate‑determinative.

Procedural guardrails
- Daubert/Rule 702 hearing keyed to a structured checklist; require standardized documentary proffers (school/CPS/medical, EPA/HUD, housing, UI, geocoded residence histories).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); defense bears a clear‑and‑convincing burden on (i) substantial degradation of inhibitory control and (ii) substantial contribution to the act.
- Limit offense domain to reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes and cases with weapon staging or concealment.
- Testing timing and conditions: conduct as early as practicable (30–60 days), standardize sleep/medication/caffeine where feasible, and document deviations.

Scientific pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds. Sleep loss, acute stress, incarceration effects, medication changes can depress executive scores and flatten cortisol. Mitigate with standardized conditions, repeat or cross‑validate testing, and reliance on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain. Use multiple performance‑validity tests; watch for “too bad to be true” patterns or selective failures.
- Acute intoxication. Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication generally defeats an excuse. Disentangle chronic toxin history (lead/FASD) from acute use.
- Reverse causation and double‑counting. Post‑offense stress can mimic chronic stress markers; group‑level adversity findings do not establish individual causation. Do not infer proximate causation from trait markers alone.
- Over‑weighting glamor science. Be skeptical of fMRI/EEG offered as silver bullets; admit only if tied to validated paradigms and used as supportive context, not determinative proof.
- Measurement equity. PCL‑R and some instruments have documented bias risks; prefer multi‑method assessment and avoid dispositive reliance on any single tool.

Jury instruction (illustrative)
“You may consider evidence of the defendant’s background and testing only if you find, by clear and convincing evidence, that at the time of the offense the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate, affect‑driven response was substantially degraded, and that this degradation was a substantial factor in causing the act. Evidence of hardship or past exposure, by itself, is not sufficient. If you find the act was planned or motivated by instrumental goals, or substantially caused by voluntary intoxication, you must reject this defense.”

Bottom line. Hart’s “fair opportunity” limit is the right lodestar, but we preserve legitimacy only if Stage 2 demands (a) strong event‑level corroboration, (b) pre‑offense documentation, and (c) carefully vetted science. With those guardrails, the doctrine should remain rare and administrable.

### Speaker: Time check

You have 15 minutes remaining. Please start to wrap up the discussion.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle and disqualifiers as a starting point, are these administrable in a busy trial court without unacceptable error costs? Please be concrete: What pretrial gatekeeping architecture would you impose (timing of a Daubert/Kumho hearing, use of court‑appointed neutral experts, required documentary proffers), and what tightly worded jury instruction would you give to connect any accepted science to Hart’s “no fair opportunity to conform” limit? If you think this is still too open‑textured, what narrower channel (e.g., automatism only or MPC EED limited to homicide) would you substitute to preserve legitimacy?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you, Chair. From a gatekeeping and administrability standpoint, I agree with Dr. Chen’s core thrust: no single test or biomarker can time‑stamp loss of control; you need alignment among history, mechanism, and the moment. The science can underwrite a narrow excuse if the court demands a structured, convergent showing and screens out alternative drivers.

What the tools can and cannot do
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop/flanker) are probative of inhibitory control; WCST is least specific and should not carry weight alone. All are state‑sensitive and must be accompanied by multiple performance‑validity checks and, where feasible, retest or cross‑task convergence.
- Stress/exposure markers (historic blood lead; credible FASD documentation; childhood iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; hair or diurnal cortisol) support mechanism and temporality but are not moment‑specific.
- fMRI/EEG have low forensic specificity; if admitted at all, they should be demonstrative and never dispositive.

Minimum bundle to justify instructing the jury on a dyscontrol excuse (clear and convincing; all prongs required)
1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid provocation‑to‑act interval; disorganized execution; no luring/weapon staging/concealment.
- Contemporaneous evidence (video/911/bodycam/witness) of “blanking out,” marked autonomic arousal, or dissociation.
2) Pre‑offense documentation (nonforensic) of stimulus‑bound loss of control
- School/IEP, juvenile MH, ED visits, or similar records pre‑dating the offense that show episodic explosive reactivity, dissociation, or sleep disruption; not first reported post‑charge.
3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Affective Stroop), with intact embedded and stand‑alone PVTs and either retest stability or cross‑task convergence.
- Low–moderate psychopathic traits (to support an impulsive, not predatory, pattern).
4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and response. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair cortisol) are supportive but not required.
5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of at least one biological insult during sensitive windows (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated or one ≥10; FASD‑risk documentation; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition), plus a plausible link to current inhibitory deficits.

Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls (any one defeats the excuse)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate cause of the act.
- Clear planning/instrumental motive (luring, weapon procurement for the event, concealment).
- Primary psychosis/mania not traceable to the RSB exposures at issue.
- Malingering or invalid testing (failed PVTs, “too bad to be true” patterns).
- Testing performed only post‑charge with no pre‑offense corroboration, or inconsistent across sessions without explanation (sleep deprivation, meds).

Procedural guardrails to preserve administrability and equity
- Pretrial Daubert/Kumho hearing on a structured proffer tied to the five‑prong bundle; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS/school, housing/EPA/HUD, employment/UI, geocoded residence history).
- Limit domain to reactive violent offenses and rare, truly impulsive nonviolent acts; presumptively exclude acquisitive/planned crime.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) the degradation was a substantial contributing cause at the time of offense.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants to avoid a de facto wealth gate.

Pitfalls for courts to watch
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress executive performance/flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; favor pre‑offense records; consider actigraphy where feasible.
- Cultural/SES bias in neuropsych norms: insist on appropriate normative references and expert explanation of their limits.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense stress effects masquerading as baseline; hair cortisol (3‑month window) and pre‑charge school/medical records help anchor temporality.
- Over‑interpretation of “hard” science: keep fMRI/EEG on a tight leash; they do not answer the legal question.
- Jury confusion: cabin expert testimony to mechanisms and clinical findings; forbid ultimate‑issue opinions on legal responsibility where applicable (Rule 704(b) analogues).

Instructional architecture and fallbacks
- If the bundle is met, a narrow automatism/dyscontrol instruction focused on “substantial impairment of the capacity to inhibit an otherwise conscious act in the moment” is appropriate. Define “substantial” (significant, not trivial) and stress that adversity alone is insufficient; the impairment must be a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- If the showing falls short, consider MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance mitigation (in homicide) and robust RSB‑based sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators (e.g., chronic unemployment, lead, malnutrition), not a full excuse.

Disposition
- Where the excuse is found, favor ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma therapy, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment) with a separate dangerousness hearing to set conditions. Reserve civil commitment for those who remain dangerous and meet mental‑illness criteria.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 criteria are directionally right; Dr. Chen’s cautions on specificity and timing are sound. With a pre‑specified, five‑pillar bundle, strict disqualifiers, and neutral‑expert gatekeeping, courts can admit this evidence without opening floodgates. Where the evidence does not converge, the proper home for RSB remains EED (in homicide) and calibrated mitigation at sentencing.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s convergence requirements as the scientific floor, can you translate this into administrable doctrine? Please draft: (a) a pretrial gatekeeping checklist for judges (Daubert‑style) to decide if the RSB–dyscontrol defense goes to the jury; and (b) a model, two‑paragraph jury instruction specifying elements, burden (clear and convincing), limiting conditions (reactive offense, no substantial voluntary intoxication or planning), and how jurors should evaluate conflicting expert testimony. Also note any default dispositions (e.g., ESB probation, civil commitment) the verdict should trigger to protect public safety.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate is the right architecture; Dr. Chen is right about what the science can and cannot do. From a court’s vantage, the problem is not conceptual but administrability: how to keep the doctrine narrow, avoid “forensic artifact” evidence, and give juries something tighter than a sociological morality play. I would adopt a pretrial admissibility screen (Rule 104(a); Daubert/Frye as applicable) keyed to specified predicates, then a lean trial presentation with a focused instruction.

1) Gatekeeping: required showings before the jury hears it
Burden: clear and convincing on each prong; defense bears it. State gets reciprocal discovery. Appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology and psychiatry; where Stage 1 relies on toxins, appoint an environmental health expert.

Stage 1 (exposure plausibility) – documentary and pre‑offense only:
- Longitudinal deprivation: objective records showing sustained residence in high‑deprivation/high‑violence tracts plus at least one other deprivation indicator (e.g., school finance/segregation metrics; repeated evictions; caregiver unemployment). Geocoding and official records, not just narrative, to avoid hearsay fights.
- Early adversity: substantiated CPS/juvenile court findings or pre‑offense clinical documentation (e.g., IEPs, ED notes) of abuse/neglect or repeated exposure to violence; validated instruments administered pre‑offense where available.
- Biological insult (at least one): childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated, or a single ≥10); documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk. These must predate the offense and be recorded outside the litigation context.

Stage 2 (case‑level attribution) – convergence, not any single datapoint:
- Event signature: evidence that the act was reactive/affective (rapid escalation post‑provocation; disorganized execution; “saw red/blanked out” contemporaneous reports; absence of luring/prep/cover‑up). Video/911/body‑cam or multiple witness accounts are high‑value corroboration.
- Pre‑offense dyscontrol: school/juvenile/medical records showing episodic, stimulus‑bound loss of control; not newly minted reports.
- Neurocognitive profile: deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go SSRT; antisaccade; affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and reasonable test–retest or cross‑task stability. WCST can be supportive but should not carry the day. Include a choice impulsivity measure (delay discounting) if available. Trait psychopathy in low–moderate range (cautiously used) supports a reactive, not predatory, profile.
- Psychiatric linkage: structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (PTSD—dissociative subtype, or Intermittent Explosive Disorder) with symptom content plausibly mapping to the index trigger. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) may corroborate chronic load but are never determinative.
- Exclusions: substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; frank primary psychosis/mania (unless independently excusing), significant malingering (failed PVTs), or evidence of instrumental motive/planning are disqualifiers.

If the defense cannot meet all of the above with competent, pre‑offense‑anchored proof and valid testing, the court should withhold the issue from the jury.

2) Minimum bundle to reach the jury (clear and convincing)
I would require all of the following:
- A reactive event profile with corroboration; and
- Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol episodes; and
- At least one documented developmental biological insult consistent with impaired prefrontal control; and
- Neuropsychological deficits on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks with intact validity indices; and
- A structured clinical diagnosis that plausibly links exposures to the index offense; and
- No substantial voluntary intoxication and no persuasive indicia of planning/instrumentality.

3) Scientific/forensic pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medication changes, and incarceration stress degrade performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer hair cortisol (pre‑offense window) over single‑day saliva; lean heavily on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Use multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; beware “too bad to be true” or selective deficits on easily feigned tasks.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Discount post‑charge diagnoses or testing in isolation; require alignment with pre‑offense history.
- Overclaiming from imaging: Exclude fMRI/EEG as determinative; admit, if at all, only as background corroboration after a Daubert/Frye showing of methodological reliability and relevance.
- Intoxication: Make clear that voluntary substance use that materially contributed to the act defeats the excuse (unless independently excusing under existing law).

4) Offense domain and structure
- Limit to reactive violent offenses (homicide/assault) and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Use bifurcation: pretrial admissibility hearing; if admitted, a tightly cabined trial presentation with a tailored instruction on “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the act,” not a general plea for sympathy.
- Jury instruction (sketch): The defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence that, because of cumulative environmental exposures and their effects, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit an immediate, angry response to a provocative trigger was substantially impaired at the moment of the act, such that he lacked a fair opportunity to conform his conduct to law. Stress that biomarkers are corroborative only; stress that ordinary stress, disadvantage, or anger do not suffice.

5) Disposition and victim protection
- If the excuse succeeds, default to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused therapy; stable housing; relocation from criminogenic blocks; sleep/nutrition; supported employment), with validated risk assessment and robust supervision (no‑contact orders, GPS where appropriate). Reserve civil commitment for those who remain dangerous and meet statutory criteria. Ensure victims’ participation at disposition.

6) Equality and resources
- Funding parity is not optional; without it, the defense becomes illusory and unevenly applied. Courts should order state funding for indigent defendants’ experts and records retrieval, and appoint neutral experts to reduce partisanship.

Bottom line
As narrowed by these predicates, Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is administrable; Dr. Chen is right that timing precision is beyond our tools, but the law often works with convergent, circumstantial proof. The error costs cut both ways. A clear‑and‑convincing, multi‑pillar showing, constrained offense domain, neutral expertise, and a focused instruction keep the gate tight. Outside this lane, I would steer RSB evidence to two existing avenues: MPC‑style EED mitigation in homicide and structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation and exposure indicators.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and legitimacy standpoint, assume we adopt Prof. Santiago’s five‑pillar bundle and Dr. Chen’s cautions. What precise jury instruction would you give for a narrow dyscontrol excuse in reactive violence cases? Please draft concise language specifying: (i) elements the defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence; (ii) a definition of “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” and “reactive dyscontrol”; (iii) the causation standard (a substantial contributing cause at the moment of offense); and (iv) explicit exclusions (voluntary intoxication as proximate driver, significant planning/cover‑up). In addition, outline a brief pretrial gatekeeping order (Daubert/Frye style) with the findings the court must make before the instruction is given, including use of neutral experts and the Stage‑1/Stage‑2 documentary thresholds.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally sound: courts should not credit any single metric as proving momentary loss of control. The only way to make a dyscontrol excuse administrable is to demand tight convergence across mechanism, history, and moment, and to keep the offense domain narrow. I would, however, streamline and reweight her Stage 2 showing for courtroom use, and build in gatekeeping to reduce junk‑science drift.

1) What the tests can and cannot show
- None of the proposed measures (SSRT/Go–No‑Go, Stroop, WCST, cortisol, historic BLLs) is specific or time‑stamped to the offense. They are probative only in combination and only insofar as they corroborate a reactive, unplanned event consistent with loss of inhibitory control.
- Within that limitation, some tools are more legally useful:
  - Stronger: Stop‑Signal (SSRT) and antisaccade (motor inhibition), affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop (inhibition under negative affect), delay discounting (impulsive choice), with multiple performance‑validity tests and, where feasible, re‑test.
  - Weaker/supportive: classic Stroop, WCST (set‑shifting), hair cortisol (chronic stress), historic BLLs (developmental insult), iron‑deficiency/malnutrition markers. fMRI should be treated as demonstrative at most; it rarely passes Daubert in this context.

2) Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing; all five)
A. Event signature (contemporaneously corroborated)
- Near‑immediate eruption after salient provocation; disorganized execution; no preparatory steps or concealment; contemporaneous accounts (“went blank,” “saw red”), ideally supported by video/911/bodycam. Evidence of luring, weapon staging, or post‑event instrumental behavior defeats the claim.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, pediatric/ED notes, juvenile mental‑health records) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation risk.

C. Neurocognitive deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and antisaccade, or SSRT and affective Go–No‑Go), plus a convergent impulsivity measure, all with intact embedded and stand‑alone performance‑validity indices (e.g., TOMM/MSVT/PVTs) and consistency across sessions or measures.

D. Psychiatric mapping to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to Stage‑1 exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and dissociation in the index event. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol slope) are supportive, not required.

E. Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one developmental insult documented independent of litigation (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or one ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), plus geocoded/housing records. These do not prove momentary loss of control; they fortify causal plausibility when paired with C and D.

Disqualifiers/controls (any one typically defeats the excuse)
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver (ordinary voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse).
- Clear instrumental motive or planning.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures (that is a different doctrine).
- Malingering/secondary gain indicators (failed validity testing; “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles).
- Testing contaminated by acute state factors (severe sleep loss, medication changes) without standardization or re‑testing.

3) Scientific pitfalls the court should police
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep deprivation, withdrawal, pain, and litigation stress can depress executive performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize test conditions; prefer pre‑offense records; consider re‑testing.
- Reverse causation and forensic artifacts: Post‑arrest stress can create abnormal profiles. Weight historic, pre‑charge documentation heavily.
- Base‑rate neglect: Many disadvantaged defendants will show some deficits; absent the event signature and pre‑offense dyscontrol, such deficits have little probative value on culpability.
- Adversarial allegiance and “Christmas‑tree” batteries: Limit to validated tasks tied to the claimed mechanism; avoid cumulative, speculative opinions; cap experts; appoint neutrals.
- PCL‑R misuse: Treat trait measures cautiously; “low psychopathy” can support a reactive profile but should not drive the analysis.
- Cross‑cultural/linguistic test norms: Ensure appropriate norms and interpreters; otherwise, deficits may be artifactual.

4) Procedural guardrails
- Narrow offense domain: confine to genuinely reactive violent offenses (and a very small class of truly impulsive nonviolent acts); exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden and standard: Defendant must prove (i) substantially degraded inhibitory control and (ii) that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act, by clear and convincing evidence.
- Pretrial Daubert/Kumho hearing (Rule 104(a)): structured proffer keyed to the bundle above; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; written findings on each element; limit cumulative experts; standardized templates for records (schools, CPS, medical labs, UI, EPA/HUD; geocoded address history).
- Jury management: bifurcate; give a focused instruction tying the excuse to Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment absent a fair opportunity to comply—and caution that trait‑level deficits alone do not establish loss of control at the moment.

5) Disposition
- If the excuse succeeds, order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused care, stable housing away from criminogenic hotspots, nutrition/sleep remediation, employment), with civil commitment available only upon the usual mental‑illness/dangerousness showing. If the excuse fails, the same record should be squarely considered at sentencing.

Bottom line
Santiago’s Stage 2 list is a good scaffold; Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence is the right evidentiary posture. For courts, the test must be conjunctive, not “any three of ten,” and anchored to the event signature plus pre‑offense documentation. With those guardrails, the doctrine will remain rare, governable, and truer to Hart’s principle of fair opportunity, while preserving public legitimacy and victim respect.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume we adopt Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle. From an administrability standpoint, what precise pretrial gatekeeping protocol and jury instruction would you write? Please specify: (i) the burden and standard at a Rule 104(a)/Daubert‑style hearing; (ii) the determinations the judge must make before submitting the excuse to the jury; and (iii) a concise pattern instruction defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and limiting the excuse to reactive violence, including an express intoxication disqualifier. If you would bifurcate, indicate where this instruction lands and why.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Two predicates must be satisfied in court: reliability under our evidence rules and “fit” to the legal issue—here, whether the defendant lacked a fair opportunity to comply at the moment of the offense. None of the proposed measures (SSRT, Stroop, WCST; cortisol; historic BLLs) has the temporal precision or specificity, standing alone, to prove momentary loss of control. As a convergent bundle—anchored in event-level phenomenology and pre‑offense documentation—they can, in a narrow class of reactive cases, support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial volitional impairment.

On specificity and timing
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the most probative of inhibitory control; Stroop adds interference control; WCST is least specific and should be down‑weighted. All are state‑sensitive and must be interpreted with validity checks and, ideally, replication or cross‑test convergence.
- Stress/toxin markers: Historic childhood BLLs and documented malnutrition/iron deficiency increase plausibility of prefrontal dyscontrol but do not time‑stamp the instant offense. Diurnal salivary cortisol is noisy; hair cortisol gives a 2–3 month window and is only supportive. None should be treated as dispositive.

Minimum converging bundle I would require (clear and convincing)
All six of the following, with no single item sufficient:

1) Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation within seconds or minutes of a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring or staging; contemporaneous corroboration (witnesses, 911/body‑cam/video) of dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”), marked autonomic arousal, or post‑event confusion.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic documentation of dyscontrol
- Records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, pediatric/ED notes, juvenile mental health documentation) evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control or dissociation. This addresses temporality and counters reverse causation.

3) Neurocognitive profile with performance validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with multiple effort validity tests passed and either stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence. Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting). Low–moderate psychopathic traits to support an impulsive (not predatory) profile.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented adversities, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and response in the instant event. Collateral records must predate the offense; post‑charge, litigation‑generated diagnoses are insufficient by themselves.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of at least one biological insult during sensitive periods (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, or one ≥10; documented early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), plus Stage‑3 deficits consistent with those exposures. High, corroborated ACEs/trauma are necessary but not a substitute for at least one objective exposure marker.

6) Exclusion of alternative proximate causes
- Toxicology and evidence exclude substantial voluntary intoxication as the driver; no strong evidence of planning/instrumental motive; rule out primary psychosis/mania or acute TBI as the principal cause; multiple malingering safeguards (embedded and stand‑alone validity tests, consistency across sessions, collateral informants).

Supportive but not required
- Hair cortisol flattening; low resting high‑frequency HRV; neighborhood‑level exposure mapping. Functional neuroimaging should be treated, at most, as weakly supportive; it is not yet courtroom‑ready to answer this legal question.

Scientific pitfalls for courts
- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, medications, caffeine, pain, and legal stress depress performance and alter cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; when feasible, repeat; prioritize pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: Require multiple validity indices and look for cross‑domain consistency; beware “too bad to be true” or selective deficits.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol and stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication should ordinarily defeat a dyscontrol excuse unless robust baseline dyscontrol is independently shown and the substance contribution is minor.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: Post‑offense incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and degrade testing; hair cortisol can anchor a pre‑offense window; weigh most heavily documentation generated before arrest.
- Base‑rate and ecological fallacy: Many people with adversity or elevated BLLs do not offend; do not infer individual causation from group correlations. Use Bradford Hill logic—temporality, plausibility, dose response—at the individual level.
- Adversarial “expert shopping” and multiple comparisons: Guard with court‑appointed neutrals, pre‑specified test batteries, and Daubert hearings focused on known error rates and external validity.

Procedural guardrails to preserve administrability and legitimacy
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing tied to a structured proffer addressing each element above; appoint neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA, unemployment records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Limit the doctrine to genuinely reactive violence (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Use bifurcation and special interrogatories so jurors make discrete findings on each prong (event signature; pre‑offense history; test results with validity; diagnosis linkage; exposure marker; exclusions).
- Clear and convincing burden on the defense.

With these constraints, Stage 2 evidence can be both admissible and probative without swamping the docket. It keeps faith with Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply—while avoiding the expressive and administrability harms of a broad, free‑standing RSB defense. Where the excuse is found, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision are the appropriate next step; civil commitment remains available for the truly dangerous.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle into a model jury instruction for a dyscontrol excuse? Please give concise operative language that: (1) assigns the burden (and standard) to the defense; (2) defines “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of the offense” in plain terms; (3) lists the required findings (e.g., documented cumulative deprivation plus at least one biological insult, pre‑offense dyscontrol history, neurocognitive deficits with valid effort, and an event signature of reactive—non‑instrumental—violence); and (4) enumerates disqualifiers (notably substantial voluntary intoxication and evidence of planning). Aim for something administrable that a trial judge could actually read to a jury.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I agree with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage architecture and, on Stage 2, largely with Dr. Chen’s scientific cautions. From an adjudicative standpoint, none of these instruments is time‑stamped to the instant of offense or specific to “loss of will.” They can, however, justify a narrow dyscontrol excuse when they converge with the event’s signature and pre‑offense documentation.

What the tools can and cannot do
- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with a well‑estimated SSRT) and antisaccade tasks are the most mechanism‑proximal; they still capture trait‑like inhibitory capacity, not a momentary lapse.
- Classic Stroop and WCST are broad executive screens; probative only in a battery and easily confounded. I would downweight WCST.
- Affective inhibition tasks (emotional Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop) better map to real‑world, affect‑laden triggers.
- Hair cortisol (3 cm) is a reasonable chronic stress index; single‑day salivary profiles are too noisy. Neither speaks to the precise moment.
- Historic childhood BLLs (especially repeated ≥5 µg/dL, or any ≥10 µg/dL) taken in sensitive periods are useful as developmental insult markers when they align with current inhibition deficits and pre‑offense records. They are not adult state measures.

Minimum converging bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard
I would require all of the following, with no single component sufficient, and with disqualifiers defeating the claim:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid, affective escalation within seconds to a couple of minutes of a salient provocation; disorganized execution; absence of advance planning/cover‑up; contemporaneous accounts or audio/video indicating “blanking out,” “seeing red,” pronounced autonomic arousal. Evidence of luring, staging, post‑event instrumental steps, or coordinated accomplices is presumptively disqualifying.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records showing episodic loss of control (school IEPs/discipline for explosive behavior, juvenile or primary‑care notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption). This anchors temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation and litigation‑artifact risks.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity safeguards
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below demographically appropriate norms (e.g., SSRT on stop‑signal; antisaccade error rates/latency; affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), replicated or cross‑validated across sessions, with multiple performance‑validity tests passed. Include a choice impulsivity metric (delay discounting) if available. Personality profile consistent with impulsive/reactive rather than predatory aggression (used cautiously; do not let a PCL‑R label do more work than warranted).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A DSM‑5 trauma/impulse‑control diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) established with structured instruments by a qualified clinician, tied to exposures documented in Stage 1, and with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index altercation. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening) is supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one relevant biological insult (e.g., childhood BLLs as above; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; credible FASD risk), plus a coherent story: insult → enduring executive‑control vulnerability → measured deficits → reactive event.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication and that intoxication was not the substantial cause of the act.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple PVTs, cross‑session consistency, and collateral informant corroboration.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the time; clear instrumental motives; or meaningful pre‑event planning disqualify.
- Testing conditions: standardize for sleep/medications; prefer early testing (30–60 days) and, where feasible, repeat or corroborate; lean on pre‑offense records.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, acute legal stress, pain, meds can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Use repeated testing and collateral sleep documentation where relevant.
- Base‑rate and ecological fallacies: many people with adversity or low scores do not offend; the law needs individual linkage, not population averages.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifacts: post‑arrest stress can mimic chronic stress signatures; hair cortisol helps, but pre‑charge records are best.
- Over‑interpretation of broad executive tests; cherry‑picking of favorable measures; undisclosed error rates. Apply Daubert/Rule 702 rigor: known error rates, standards/controls, peer review, general acceptance, and appropriate limits on the expert’s conclusions.
- Overuse of fMRI/EEG as “pictures of guiltlessness”: admit, if at all, as modestly probative, never dispositive.

Administrability: a judge’s gatekeeping rubric
- Pretrial reliability hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the five elements above; require notice; appoint neutral experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; ensure funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Limit the doctrine to affective, provoked violent offenses (and a very small class of truly impulsive nonviolent acts); exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Require special verdict interrogatories so the jury states whether (a) a transient episode of reactive dyscontrol occurred, and (b) it was substantially caused by cumulative RSB (as defined) and (c) absent that dyscontrol the defendant probably would have complied.
- Provide a focused instruction that distinguishes an excuse (no fair opportunity to control at the moment) from mere anger or moral condemnation of the environment.

In short: the Stage 2 suite can support, but never by itself compel, an inference of substantial volitional impairment. The minimum bundle should be demanding: event signature plus pre‑offense documentation plus valid neurocognitive deficits plus a mapped psychiatric diagnosis plus an objective developmental insult, with no disqualifiers. That is a tight gate—appropriate if we mean to honor Hart’s fairness limit without inviting floodgates or eroding public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and error-cost perspective, if you were drafting a model gatekeeping rule for a dyscontrol-based RSB excuse, what precise Daubert factors and categorical exclusions would you codify to keep this tight? Please propose concrete pretrial language (e.g., required "five-pillar" convergence, neutral court-appointed experts, timing of testing, and per se bars like substantial voluntary intoxication or evidence of planning) that trial judges could apply consistently without turning every case into a sprawling trial-within-a-trial.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen’s bottom line: no single instrument can time‑stamp volitional collapse; the only honest way to attribute reactive dyscontrol is through convergence across mechanism, history, and the moment. My concerns are institutional—how to cabin this so trial courts can administer it without inviting junk neuroscience or turning every violent case into a mini‑lab.

What I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard

Limit the doctrine to genuinely reactive violence. Then demand the following bundle; each item is necessary, none alone is sufficient:

1) Event‑level signature (proximate to offense)
- Salient provocation followed by seconds‑to‑minutes escalation; disorganization; no luring, staging, or concealment.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam or neutral witnesses) of dissociation/“seeing red”/marked autonomic arousal.
- Presumptive defeat if there is weapon pre‑positioning, post‑event instrumental conduct, or efforts to avoid detection.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (nonforensic)
- School/juvenile/medical records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound explosions, dissociation, IED‑like episodes, chronic sleep disruption—i.e., temporality not manufactured post‑charge.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., Stop‑Signal or Go/No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go/Stroop); WCST is peripheral.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) clean; reasonable stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive, not predatory, aggression (use PCL‑R cautiously; low‑to‑moderate range only).

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the incident
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose trigger/symptom profile plausibly explains the index event, anchored to exposures documented before the offense.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent records of at least one biological insult during sensitive periods (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated, or any ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk).
- Stress physiology (hair cortisol over prior 3 months) is supportive but not necessary; diurnal salivary cortisol is too noisy to carry weight alone.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as a proximate driver defeats the excuse (absent involuntary intoxication).
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, or clear instrumental motives.
- Guard against malingering: require raw data, PVTs, and, if needed, re‑testing by a neutral examiner.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds: Acute sleep loss, meds, and incarceration stress depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: “Too bad to be true” neurocognitive profiles, selective failures, or symptom over‑reporting; insist on validity measures and collateral informants.
- Acute intoxication: Don’t convert substance effects into excuse.
- Reverse causation: Post‑charge stress biology is not proof of pre‑offense dyscontrol; hair cortisol and historical labs help.
- Neuro‑glitz: fMRI/EEG lack forensic specificity and invite Rule 403 problems; admit, if at all, only as background science, not case‑specific proof.
- Norms and equity: Many tests have cultural/educational biases; ensure appropriate normative corrections and qualified bilingual examiners where needed.

Procedural guardrails (administrability)

- Pretrial Daubert/702 hearing keyed to a standardized checklist; require defense proffers to be documentary‑heavy (medical/CPS/school/EPA‑HUD/UI records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (FRE 706 or state analog) in neuropsych, psychiatry, and environmental health; equal testing access for indigent defendants; production of raw test data to both sides.
- Laboratory reliability: CLIA‑certified labs for cortisol/lead; document chain of custody; specify hair treatment confounds.
- Offense filter: Confine to reactive violent offenses; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes.
- Burden and instruction: Defense must prove (i) substantially degraded capacity to inhibit an aggressive response and (ii) that this degradation was a substantial contributing factor in the act, by clear and convincing evidence. Give a tailored instruction tying culpability to Hart’s “fair opportunity to conform,” and distinguish this excuse from MPC §210.3 EED (partial mitigation) and from insanity.

Disposition

If excused, default to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation, sleep/nutrition interventions, employment supports), with risk assessment and victim‑input. Reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous under ordinary commitment standards.

Bottom line

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 architecture is directionally right. To keep faith with juries and victims—and to avoid floodgates—we should (a) weight event phenomenology and pre‑offense documentation heavily, (b) treat neurocognitive and biomarker findings as corroboration with strict validity safeguards, and (c) exclude cases where planning, intoxication, or predation drive the result. This keeps the avenue narrow, rule‑governed, and reserved for the exceptional defendant who truly lacked a fair chance to hold back.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, do Prof. Santiago’s/Dr. Chen’s “reactive dyscontrol” bundle (five pillars, Daubert hearing, neutral experts, clear‑and‑convincing burden) clear the bar for use at the guilt phase, or should this be cabined to sentencing mitigation? Please name the one or two procedural guardrails you view as indispensable (e.g., mandatory court‑appointed experts, limiting to demonstrably reactive violence, special verdict form) and explain where you’d set the threshold to minimize false positives without making the doctrine illusory.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 is directionally sound, but courts must remember two things: none of these instruments time‑stamps loss of control at the moment of offense, and many are state‑sensitive. The science can support a “highly likely” inference when multiple strands line up; it cannot, standing alone, carry the day. The event narrative remains the anchor.

On the tools’ fit for purpose
- Neurocognitive tasks
  - Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (with valid SSRT) and antisaccade are the best of the lot for inhibitory control; Stroop is supportive but less specific; WCST is least probative and I would downweight or omit it.
  - Include an affective variant (emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop) given the affect‑laden triggers in reactive assaults.
  - Must include multiple performance‑validity tests; repeat or cross‑validate to reduce transient state noise (sleep loss, meds, acute stress).
- Stress/biologic markers
  - Hair cortisol (3 cm segment) is a better chronic‑load index than single‑day salivary profiles, but it remains nonspecific and subject to confounds (hair treatment, ethnicity).
  - Historic childhood blood‑lead (BLL) and early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency records are probative of developmental insult to prefrontal systems; they establish plausibility, not momentary loss of control.
  - HRV/threat‑startle may add modest support for an affect‑regulation mechanism.

What I would require to meet clear and convincing
I would confine any dyscontrol excuse to reactive violence and build a tight, rule‑governed bundle. All mandatory elements below must be met; absent that, RSB belongs at sentencing.

Mandatory elements (all three):
1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Seconds‑to‑minutes latency after a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions (from witnesses, 911, body‑cam) of “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal; no post‑event concealment indicative of planning.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, predating records evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, prior ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption tied to neighborhood violence).

3) Rule‑outs
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver; no primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; no strong instrumental motive; malingering safeguards satisfied (multiple PVTs, consistency across sessions).

Plus at least two of the following three categories (and ideally all three):
4) Neurocognitive inhibition deficits with validity
- ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with intact validity indices and stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence; impulsive rather than predatory trait profile (use PCL‑R cautiously).

5) Objective developmental exposure biomarker
- Independent documentation of at least one biological insult in sensitive windows (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or any ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; FASD risk) that plausibly contributes to the observed executive deficits.

6) Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, with symptom content and triggers plausibly explaining the incident; physiological corroboration of chronic stress (e.g., hair cortisol flattening, low resting HF‑HRV) is supportive but not required.

Procedural guardrails
- Daubert/Rule 702 pretrial hearing tied to a standardized checklist; contemporaneous testing as early as feasible (30–60 days) with standardized conditions (sleep, caffeine, meds) and, where practicable, a re‑test; heavy weight on pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact.”
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) to counter partisanship; reciprocal discovery and documentary templates (labs, CPS/school/housing/EPA/UI, geocoded exposure histories).
- Offense restriction: presumptively inapplicable to planned acquisitive crimes or predatory violence; if the bundle is incomplete, channel the evidence to imperfect mitigation (e.g., MPC EED in homicide) or sentencing.

Key scientific pitfalls courts should watch
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep deprivation, incarceration stress, medication changes can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize conditions; rely on pre‑offense documentation; prefer hair cortisol to single‑day saliva.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; beware selective or “too bad to be true” profiles; check cross‑task coherence.
- Acute intoxication: voluntary intoxication degrades inhibition and should ordinarily defeat the excuse; distinguish developmental toxin history (lead) from acute substances.
- Reverse causation and timing: post‑charge stress can mimic chronic stress signatures; pre‑charge school/medical/EPA records and child‑era BLLs anchor temporality.
- Over‑claiming from imaging: fMRI/EEG should not be admitted as dispositive; if admitted at all, treat as low‑weight corroboration tethered to validated behavioral measures.
- Norms and equity: ensure tests use appropriate demographic norms; be wary of culture‑ or language‑biased measures masquerading as “deficits.”

Bottom line
The Stage 2 apparatus can be evidentially useful if it is subordinated to a narrow, offense‑focused event signature and buttressed by pre‑offense records and objective developmental exposures. Require convergence; keep the gate high (clear and convincing); and use neutral expertise and standardized checklists. Where the showing falls short, the same materials should inform MPC‑style EED in homicide and structured sentencing mitigation, not a full excuse. This preserves administrability and public legitimacy while honoring Hart’s fairness limit in the rare case of true involuntary‑rage automatism.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle and the disqualifiers she outlined, how would you translate this into courtroom machinery that is both fair and administrable? Please be concrete: (i) Daubert gate—what showing must the defense make in a pretrial proffer, and would you appoint neutral experts as a matter of course? (ii) Burdens/standard—do you endorse clear and convincing for the ultimate excuse and a lower threshold for admissibility, and who bears what at each stage? (iii) Jury management—would you bifurcate (guilt first, then RSB excuse), give a special instruction distinguishing excuse from justification and from intoxication, and use a special verdict form? (iv) Scope—limit to reactive violent offenses only, or also impulsive nonviolent ones, and categorical bar where there is evidence of planning? Please also flag any error‑cost concerns or equality risks you’d mitigate (e.g., funding parity, standardized record templates), and offer a model one‑paragraph jury instruction that captures “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the moment” without inviting nullification.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate is the right architecture. Where I would tighten—and what I would ask a trial court to demand at Stage 2—tracks three concerns: (i) temporal fit to the moment, (ii) evidentiary reliability under Rule 702/Daubert, and (iii) error costs if we over-read nonspecific science.

1) What the science can and can’t do
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop-signal (SSRT), Go/No-Go, antisaccade, and an affective inhibition task (emotional Stroop or affective Go/No-Go) are the closest we have to inhibitory control. WCST is weakly tied to the mechanism and should be downweighted. Stroop classic is supportive only. All testing must include multiple performance-validity indices and, ideally, a re-test or cross-test convergence to dampen state noise.
- Biomarkers: Childhood blood lead (especially repeated ≥5 µg/dL or any prior ≥10) is probative of developmental insult but not time-stamping. Hair cortisol provides a 2–3 month stress window; single-day salivary profiles are too noisy. HRV and startle are supportive, not dispositive. fMRI/EEG add little incremental, case-level probative value and carry undue-prejudice risks; I would presumptively exclude them from the jury and confine to the gatekeeping record, if at all.
- Psychiatry: PTSD (dissociative subtype) and Intermittent Explosive Disorder can anchor a mechanism if established with structured instruments and pre-offense records; they are not specific by themselves.

2) Minimum convergence I would require (clear and convincing), with defense bearing the burden
No single strand suffices. I would require all of A–D plus E (exclusions):

A. Event signature (indispensable)
- Reactive/affective episode with near-immediate escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, preparation, or concealment; contemporaneous corroboration (witnesses, 911/bodycam, video) of “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal, or dissociation. Any meaningful planning or instrumental post‑event behavior should be presumptively disqualifying from a dyscontrol excuse (may still go to EED or mitigation).

B. Pre-offense documentation (indispensable)
- Nonforensic, pre-charge records evidencing stimulus-bound loss of control or affective dysregulation (school IEP/discipline, juvenile mental health notes, ED visits for rage episodes, documented chronic sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reverse-causation.

C. Neurocognitive profile (with validity)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below age/sex-appropriate norms on at least two inhibition/affect-regulation tasks among SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No-Go/affective Stroop, with intact performance validity and either re-test stability or cross-task convergence. Include one impulsive-choice measure (delay discounting) if available. Low-to-moderate psychopathy scores to support an impulsive—not predatory—profile.

D. Exposure/physiological linkage (at least one objective insult plus, where feasible, stress physiology)
- At least one documented developmental biological insult independent of litigation (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or any ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; prenatal alcohol exposure). Hair cortisol profile consistent with chronic load is supportive; not mandatory if A–C are strong.
- A DSM‑5 trauma/impulse-control diagnosis established with structured methods that plausibly maps onto the index episode’s triggers and phenomena.

E. Exclusions/controls (mandatory)
- Voluntary intoxication: If substantial intoxication is a proximate driver, the excuse fails. Baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication must be shown where substances are present.
- Malingering/state effects: Multiple PVTs; standardized testing conditions; watch for “too-bad-to-be-true” patterns. Consider brief re-testing. Account for acute sleep deprivation/legal stress.
- Alternative primary causes: Rule out frank psychosis or mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time, or clear instrumental motive.

3) Procedural safeguards
- Pretrial Daubert/702 hearing tied to a checklist reflecting the elements above; written proffer with exhibits (labs, CPS/school/housing/EPA/UI records; geocoded exposure history).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Party experts permitted but neutral opinions required to proceed.
- Notice requirements and standardized testing batteries to reduce expert shopping.
- Limiting the domain: confine the dyscontrol excuse to reactive violent offenses; planned acquisitive crime should be channeled to mitigation, not excuse.
- Jury management: If the defense survives the gate, use special interrogatories (e.g., “Did the defendant, at the time of the act, suffer a substantial impairment of inhibitory control?” and “Was that impairment substantially caused by documented RSB exposures?”). Provide a cautionary instruction on the limited probative value of neuro/biological evidence and the non-deterministic nature of correlations.

4) Relationship to doctrine and disposition
- Keep the guilt-phase avenue narrow: in my view, only cases meeting the automatism‑like, involuntary‑rage profile warrant a complete excuse. Otherwise, in homicide, MPC‑style EED provides the right middle ground; all other RSB showing goes to structured sentencing mitigation.
- Disposition if excused: ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (housing relocation, trauma therapy, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines) under court supervision, with civil commitment reserved for those meeting traditional mental‑illness‑dangerousness criteria. This addresses public-safety and victim concerns without the expressive endorsement Prof. Watkins fears.

5) Pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounding: anchor to pre-offense documentation; repeat or corroborate testing; avoid over-weighting post-charge physiology.
- Reverse causation from incarceration stress: hair cortisol helps but is not a panacea.
- Base-rate neglect: many deprived defendants will show mild deficits; insist on the full bundle and event‑level fit.
- Collateral mini-trials: sibling “negative controls” add little for courts and risk unfairness; I would not require them.
- Neuro glamour: exclude fMRI/EEG at trial absent a showing of incremental, case-specific probative value outweighing prejudice; most cases won’t meet that showing.

Bottom line: Prof. Santiago’s five‑pillar approach, as refined by Dr. Chen, can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a small slice of truly reactive cases. Courts should privilege event phenomenology and pre‑offense records, treat neurocognitive and biomarker data as supportive rather than dispositive, and keep the doctrinal channels narrow: involuntary‑rage automatism for the rare case; EED for homicide; otherwise, RSB belongs at sentencing with validated mitigation frameworks.

### Speaker: Time check

You have 15 minutes remaining. Please start to wrap up the discussion.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, putting on your Rule 702/Daubert hat, would you admit the bundle Dr. Chen outlined (SSRT/Go–No-Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop, hair cortisol profiles, historic childhood BLLs), and under what conditions? Please specify concrete admissibility criteria you’d impose (e.g., peer‑reviewed validity, known error rates, standardized testing conditions, performance‑validity checks, timing relative to the offense), any categorical exclusions (e.g., fMRI), and the limiting instruction you’d give to ensure jurors don’t conflate trait risk with momentary loss of control.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you, Chair. Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate is directionally right. As a matter of adjudication, Stage 2 must do the heaviest lifting: nothing we have in the laboratory or clinic “time‑stamps” loss of control to the moment of offense. These tools can corroborate a reactive dyscontrol narrative; they cannot by themselves prove it. So the court should insist on alignment among (i) the event’s signature, (ii) pre‑offense documentation, and (iii) trait‑level deficits measured with sound validity safeguards.

On the proposed tools

- Neurocognitive tasks:
  - Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go (with a reliable SSRT estimate) are the most probative for inhibitory control. Keep them; require performance‑validity tests and, where feasible, re‑test for stability.
  - Add an affect‑laden inhibition task (affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop). Many “reflexive” assaults are under negative affect; a purely neutral Stroop is less informative.
  - WCST is a generic set‑shifting task—low specificity to the mechanism at issue. Downweight or replace with antisaccade or flanker.
  - Include a delay‑discounting or related impulsive choice measure as supportive only.
- Stress/exposure markers:
  - Historic blood lead levels (especially repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, or any ≥10) meaningfully raise mechanistic plausibility when paired with current executive deficits; they are not moment‑specific.
  - Diurnal salivary cortisol is noisy; hair cortisol over a 3‑month window is better for chronic load, but still nonspecific. Treat as corroborative, not determinative.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition records and documented prenatal alcohol exposure are supportive where they predate the offense.
- Brain imaging:
  - fMRI/EEG do not meet specificity or temporal precision for moment‑level attribution. If admitted at all, it should be strictly as low‑weight corroboration under Rule 403 balancing.

Minimum converging bundle to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard

I would require all five of these, with no single item sufficient:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; no luring, staging, or concealment; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions (from bystanders, 911 audio, body‑cam) of “seeing red/blanking,” marked autonomic arousal, or dissociation. Any evidence of planning/goal‑seeking post‑event conduct should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense, non‑forensic documentation of episodic dyscontrol
- School IEP/discipline records, pediatric notes, juvenile mental‑health records, prior ED visits reflecting stimulus‑bound rages/dissociation or sleep disruption—created before the charge.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity safeguards
- At least two inhibitory/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT and affective Go–No‑Go) ≥1.5 SD below norms, plus intact effort indices (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs). Prefer re‑testing or cross‑task convergence. Trait profile should be impulsive/reactive, not predatory (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R, used cautiously).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored to Stage‑1 exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and response in the instant case. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol) are helpful but optional.

5) Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one developmental biological insult documented independent of litigation (childhood BLLs, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, or prenatal alcohol exposure), temporally predating the observed executive deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls:

- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/drug effects as the proximate cause should defeat the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple validity measures; consistency across sessions; collateral informants. Be alert to “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Alternative cause exclusion: rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time of offense, and clear instrumental motives.
- Timing: testing as early as practicable (ideally within 60–90 days), with heavy weight on pre‑charge records to avoid reverse‑causation (incarceration stress, litigation coaching).

Scientific pitfalls the court should police

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, pain, and legal stress depress task performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; prefer replication or convergence; weigh pre‑offense documentation heavily.
- Base‑rate neglect: many disadvantaged defendants will meet Stage‑1 adversity without Stage‑2 alignment. The bundle is designed to keep the doctrine rare.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers: treat cortisol, imaging, and even BLLs as plausibility enhancers only; they do not locate impairment at T‑0.
- Litigation artifacts: insist on records created before the offense (schools, clinics, CPS, housing, EPA/HUD, unemployment insurance), not just post‑charge evaluations.

Procedural architecture to keep the gate narrow and legitimate

- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing under Rule 104(a) with a structured checklist keyed to the five‑pillar bundle; require written findings on each element to facilitate appellate review.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) under the jurisdiction’s analogue to Rule 706; equal funding for indigent defense to avoid structural inequality.
- Offense domain limitation: confine to reactive violent offenses (and only exceptionally to truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Bifurcation and tailored instructions: if the gate is cleared, give a specialized instruction that the excuse turns on substantial degradation of inhibitory control at the time of the act, not on deprivation per se; instruct that voluntary intoxication defeats the excuse.
- Spillover channel: where the bundle falls short, the same evidence should be available for MPC‑style EED in homicide and for structured sentencing mitigation.

Bottom line

Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 criteria are useable if the court treats them as converging indicators, not as silver bullets. With the five‑pillar bundle, the clear‑and‑convincing burden, neutral experts, and narrow offense scope, we can honor Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply—while keeping the doctrine administrable and the public’s confidence intact. Where doubt remains, the safer institutional course is to channel the evidence to mitigation rather than full excuse, and to use ESB‑oriented, supervised dispositions to protect victims and reduce recurrence when the excuse is found.

### Speaker: Host

Building on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s “five pillars,” please design the pretrial gatekeeping architecture for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse. Concretely: (i) what documentary proffer must the defense make before a Daubert/104(a) hearing; (ii) which expert domains would you require or appoint (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health), and how would you rule on admissibility of SSRT/Go‑No‑Go, hair cortisol, childhood BLLs, and PCL‑R under Daubert; and (iii) draft a concise, plain‑English jury instruction that defines “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and “reactive (as opposed to planned) conduct,” states a clear‑and‑convincing burden, and warns against using deprivation alone. Please also note any requirement for pre‑offense records, and how you’d avoid life‑history mini‑trials while ensuring indigent funding parity.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you. I’ll take this from the court’s gatekeeping and administrability vantage, building on Dr. Chen’s science.

1) Specificity and temporal sensitivity
- None of the proposed instruments is time-stamped to the moment of offense. That is not fatal if the law demands “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time,” proven by convergence, not a single biomarker.
- Of the tools listed, only stop-signal/go–no-go (with well-estimated SSRT) and antisaccade/affective inhibition tasks speak directly to inhibitory control. Stroop (especially classic color–word) and WCST are too nonspecific to carry much weight; use them, at most, for context.
- Historic BLLs (during early childhood) and documented malnutrition are probative of longstanding prefrontal vulnerability; hair/diurnal cortisol is a coarse index of chronic stress, supportive but not dispositive. fMRI should be excluded in individual attribution (Rule 702/Daubert/403): it lacks individual-diagnostic validity and is unduly prejudicial.

2) Minimum converging bundle (clear and convincing)
I would require ALL of the following, with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health) and a pretrial Daubert hearing; defense bears the burden:

A. Event signature (proximate, reactive)
- Credible evidence of an affective, stimulus‑bound escalation (seconds/minutes), disorganized execution, no luring or preparation, no concealment/cleanup. Prefer contemporaneous corroboration (video/bodycam/911/witness) of dissociation or autonomic arousal. Any meaningful planning or instrumental motive should defeat the excuse.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic, pre‑charge records (school discipline/IEP, juvenile/ED notes, CPS, prior treatment) evidencing episodic loss of control, dissociation, or explosive reactivity. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns from post‑offense testing/incarceration.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., SSRT from stop‑signal, antisaccade error rate/latency, affective go–no‑go or affective Stroop), plus one impulsive choice index (e.g., delay discounting) consistent with disinhibition; AND
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) intact; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence. Downweight or omit WCST in the primary showing. Treat PCL‑R cautiously; a low–moderate score can support a reactive (not predatory) profile but is not required.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and response pattern in the instant offense; anchored to documented exposures. Biological stress markers (e.g., hair cortisol flattening; low resting HF‑HRV) may corroborate but should not be required.

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, pre‑litigation records of at least one relevant insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL, ideally repeated or any ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented prenatal alcohol exposure), temporally situated in sensitive developmental windows.

Disqualifiers/controls (all must be satisfied)
- Voluntary intoxication: if acute alcohol/drug effects plausibly drove the episode, the excuse fails (mitigation may remain).
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, or strong instrumental motive: defeats the excuse.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, cross‑source consistency; allow prosecution access to raw data; permit independent retesting.
- State–trait control: standardize testing conditions (sleep/meds/caffeine); where feasible, repeat testing; rely heavily on pre‑offense records to avoid forensic artifacts.

3) Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds and reverse causation: post‑charge stress and sleep loss can depress executive performance and cortisol. Demand pre‑offense records; prefer hair cortisol (3‑month window) over single‑day salivary profiles; recognize hair-treatment/ethnicity confounds.
- Task nonspecificity: do not over‑interpret Stroop/WCST. The inhibition showing must rest on tasks with known links to motor/affective inhibition.
- Overreach on neuroimaging: exclude individual‑level fMRI/EEG attribution; admit only if used to explain mechanisms generally, with strict limiting instructions.
- Base‑rate neglect: many individuals with adversity show deficits but retain control; make the event‑level signature and exclusion of planning the fulcrum.

4) Procedural guardrails
- Two‑stage gate (as Prof. Santiago outlined): Stage 1 cumulative exposure eligibility; Stage 2 case‑level attribution. Conduct a pretrial Daubert/Rule 104(a) hearing keyed to a standardized checklist; appoint neutral experts; require notice and documentary proffers (geocoded exposure histories; medical/CPS/school/EPA/UI records).
- Limit the domain: confine the excuse to reactive violent offenses. Channel planned acquisitive crimes and mixed‑motive cases to sentencing mitigation instead.
- Jury management: if the court finds sufficiency, give a narrow instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” in Hart’s “fair opportunity to comply” terms, with special verdict interrogatories (e.g., reactive vs. instrumental; planning present/absent; impairment a substantial contributing cause).

5) Disposition
- Where excuse is found, prefer ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma treatment, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, job placement) with risk‑responsive supervision; reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

Bottom line
As a bundle—with strict event‑level criteria, objective developmental insults, pre‑offense documentation, valid inhibitory deficits, and careful exclusion of alternatives—the showing can meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow slice of cases. The court’s task is to keep the science in its lane, prevent “junk neuro,” and ensure the doctrine remains a rare excuse for involuntary‑rage/dyscontrol cases, while pushing the rest of RSB into structured mitigation at sentencing.

### Speaker: Host

Given Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five-pillar attribution with intoxication exclusions and neutral-expert Daubert screens, do these constraints meaningfully reduce your floodgates and equality concerns? If not, identify the single highest residual risk you see (e.g., disparate access to testing, victim safety, jury confusion), and specify one concrete procedural safeguard or scope limitation you would require as a condition of supporting any dyscontrol excuse at guilt.

---

### Speaker: Ms. Janice Whitford

Ms. Whitford:

I come at this as someone who has tried these cases and then had to live with their downstream effects in neighborhoods already bearing the brunt of violence. My bottom line: most of the proposed Stage 2 tools are, at best, supportive of a mitigation story. They are not, by themselves, specific or time‑stamped enough to carry an excuse at guilt without serious error costs. If a jurisdiction insists on a dyscontrol excuse, the gate must be much tighter than what we ordinarily tolerate for mitigation.

Are the measures specific/temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive batteries (stop‑signal, Go/No‑Go, Stroop, antisaccade) capture trait‑level inhibitory weaknesses with modest effect sizes and high state noise (sleep, meds, motivation). They cannot tell you that control failed at 9:42 p.m.
- Stress markers (diurnal/hair cortisol) and historic blood lead levels are chronic load/exposure indicators. They strengthen plausibility; they do not time‑link impairment to the instant offense.
- fMRI/EEG add little probative value in court and high risk of seduction by neuroscience.

If we are going to allow an excuse, I would require all of the following to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard, and I would confine applicability to truly reactive interpersonal violence (no planned robberies, burglaries, luring, weapon retrieval beyond immediate reach, pursuit, or post‑event concealment):

Minimum converging bundle (all required)
1) Event‑level corroboration of reactive dyscontrol
- Provocation immediately preceding the act; escalation within seconds/minutes; no chase/pursuit; no weapon fetching; disorganized execution.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (video/911/body‑cam or multiple neutral witnesses) of “blanking out,” dissociation, or marked autonomic arousal.
- No evidence of planning, coordinated co‑offending, or instrumental motive.

2) Clean toxicology and alternative‑cause exclusion
- Negative (or minimal, non‑impairing) voluntary intoxication proximate to the event; if substances are present, the defense fails absent extraordinary proof that baseline dyscontrol independently would have produced the act.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, or clear retaliatory/gang directive.

3) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive behavior, pediatric/ED notes, juvenile court/mental health records) showing stimulus‑bound loss of control or dissociation. Not complaints created after arrest.

4) Neurocognitive deficits with validity and replication
- At least two independent tests directly tied to inhibition/affect regulation (e.g., stop‑signal/SSRT and affective Go–No‑Go or antisaccade) ≥1.5 SD below norms, with multiple performance‑validity tests passed.
- Stability across two sessions or cross‑test convergence; testing performed within 30–60 days of the offense under standardized conditions (sleep/meds documented).

5) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified, court‑appointed clinician, anchored to pre‑offense exposures and symptom triggers that plausibly explain the index offense; not merely “stress” labels.

6) Objective developmental insult
- At least one pre‑litigation, objective exposure consistent with impaired inhibition (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL or a single ≥10; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition; credible FASD risk; verified early chronic sleep disruption), tied temporally to sensitive developmental windows.

7) Independent, neutral expertise and adversarial testing
- Court‑appointed neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health experts; Daubert‑style pretrial hearing; full disclosure of raw data; funding parity for indigent defendants.

Key scientific/legal pitfalls courts must police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication changes can depress task performance and flatten cortisol. Require standardized testing and, where possible, replication and reliance on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: mandate multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; watch for selective or “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” impairment.
- Acute intoxication: alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intoxication should presumptively defeat a dyscontrol excuse.
- Reverse causation/ecological fallacy: do not infer individual causation from neighborhood‑level adversity alone; avoid attributing post‑offense physiological changes to pre‑offense states.
- Overreach with imaging/biomarkers: treat fMRI/EEG/cortisol as supportive at most; they are not diagnostic of momentary volitional failure.
- Inequality/administrability: these showings are resource‑intensive. Without guaranteed funding and neutral experts, the doctrine will amplify disparities and erode legitimacy.

Disposition if the gate is met
- No unconditional walk‑out. A special verdict (e.g., not guilty by reason of dyscontrol) should trigger court‑supervised ESB conditions tailored to the mechanism (trauma therapy, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, removal from criminogenic contexts), robust risk management, and victims’ safety planning; civil commitment reserved for continuing danger. Victims must have a voice at disposition.

Policy view
- My strong preference is to channel this evidence to structured mitigation and, in homicide, to MPC‑style EED or tightly defined automatism, rather than a freestanding excuse at guilt. If an excuse exists, it must be rare, rule‑governed, and victim‑protective. Otherwise we risk disparate application, blurred lines between explanation and exculpation, and reduced protection for the very communities living with the daily costs of street crime.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, from an administrability and error‑cost perspective, can courts realistically operationalize Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar attribution bundle without turning every violent case into a mini‑trial of life history and neuroscience? Please be concrete: (i) what should a Daubert‑style pretrial proffer require (specific records, test types, timing) before the jury ever hears RSB evidence; (ii) which categorical exclusions (e.g., planned/instrumental offenses, substantial voluntary intoxication) would you codify; and (iii) what one‑paragraph model jury instruction would you give on “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” to keep the jury focused and preserve legitimacy?

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Thank you, Chair. Speaking as a judge concerned with administrability and error costs, I would treat Prof. Santiago’s Stage 2 as directionally right but usable only under a tightly structured gate. None of the proposed tests or biomarkers is specific or time‑precise enough standing alone to prove loss of control “at the moment.” They can, however, support a clear–and–convincing inference when they converge with event‑level facts and pre‑offense records.

What I would require (clear and convincing; defense burden)

A. Event signature (indispensable)
- Reactive, affect‑laden episode with minimal planning; rapid escalation after a salient trigger; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions of “seeing red/blanking out,” marked autonomic arousal; post‑event confusion. Prefer objective corroboration (video, 911/body‑cam, neutral witnesses).
- Disqualifiers: luring, weapon staging, concealment/flight consistent with instrumental goals.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (indispensable)
- Nonforensic records predating the offense: school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile or primary‑care notes of dissociation/IED‑like episodes, prior ED visits for rage, chronic sleep disruption tied to environment. This anchors temporality and reduces reverse‑causation risk.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity (required; content‑specific)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks directly on point (e.g., Stop‑Signal SSRT; Go/No‑Go or antisaccade; an affective variant like emotional Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop). Include delay‑discounting if available.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) and, ideally, repeat or cross‑test convergence within 30–60 days. Down‑weight WCST; it is not specific to inhibition.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive (e.g., low‑moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage (supportive but not independently sufficient)
- Structured‑interview diagnosis mapping exposures to symptoms (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with collateral corroboration. Biological corroboration of chronic stress (hair cortisol flattening; low resting HRV) may support but should not be required.

E. Objective exposure history/biological insult (at least one; pre‑offense)
- Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated, or one ≥10), or documented FASD risk, or iron‑deficiency/malnutrition in sensitive windows, or verified chronic sleep deprivation from environmental causes. These are not time‑stamps but strengthen causal plausibility.

F. Exclusions/controls (all must be satisfied)
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver (routine alcohol/drug use that itself degraded inhibition should not carry the defense).
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless proceeding under a different doctrine), acute TBI at the event, malingering (multiple PVTs), and clear instrumental motives.
- Prefer pre‑charge records; if all evidence is generated post‑charge, require independent corroboration.

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, pain, and legal stress can depress performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; consider limited retest; lean on pre‑offense records.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity checks; be wary of “too bad to be true” patterns or selective impairment on easy‑to‑fake tasks.
- Acute intoxication: alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary intox should presumptively defeat the excuse.
- Reverse causation: incarceration stress can blunt cortisol and worsen testing; hair cortisol (3‑month window) and historical labs mitigate this.
- Over‑interpretation of neuro‑imaging: fMRI/EEG should be treated, at most, as supportive and not dispositive; exclude glossy but non‑probative scans under Rule 403/Daubert.

Gatekeeping protocol (to keep the doctrine governable)

- Notice and proffer: standardized checklist tying each element A–F to specific documents/tests; geocoded exposure histories (lead orders, school finance, crime exposure) and medical/lab records.
- Daubert‑style pretrial hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Equal funding for indigent defendants to avoid unequal access.
- Offense domain: limit to reactive violent offenses (and exceptional truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Burden/standard: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act (not mere background risk).
- Timing: testing within 30–60 days where feasible; heavy weight to pre‑offense records.
- Discovery: reciprocal disclosure of raw data and scoring for independent review.

Jury instruction sketch (if the court lets it go to the jury)

- Define “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” (not mere anger, not ordinary impulsivity).
- Require both prongs: substantial impairment and a substantial causal role in the instant act.
- Remind: voluntary intoxication cannot supply the impairment for this excuse.
- If the excuse fails, instruct on MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or treat the evidence at sentencing mitigation.

Bottom line

- The proposed batteries and stress markers are not specific enough alone, but, when they converge with event‑level facts and pre‑offense documentation and when alternatives are excluded, they can meet a clear‑and‑convincing threshold in a narrow slice of cases.
- With the safeguards above, the risk of floodgates is low; most cases will fail at the event‑signature or pre‑offense‑documentation steps.
- Disposition should be ESB‑oriented and supervised, with civil commitment only where the person remains demonstrably dangerous. This preserves public legitimacy while honoring Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment where there was no fair opportunity to comply.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage screen and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar convergence as a starting point, translate this into an administrable protocol: (i) at a pretrial Daubert‑style hearing, what exactly must the defense proffer to reach the jury, and what evidence would you categorically exclude (e.g., WCST, single‑day salivary cortisol, post‑offense‑only testing)? (ii) what burden of proof and offense carve‑outs would you adopt; and (iii) what concise jury instruction would you give on “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” to prevent jurors from treating poverty alone as exculpatory while still honoring Hart’s ‘no fair opportunity’ limit? Please be concrete about language and thresholds.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen: no single test or biomarker can time‑stamp loss of control; courts need convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment. From an administrability and evidence law perspective, here is what I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard under a narrowly tailored, dyscontrol‑based excuse, with tight Daubert gatekeeping and a limited offense domain (reactive homicides/assaults).

1) Offense domain and event signature
- Eligible offenses: reactive homicide/attempted homicide and aggravated assault where proof suggests seconds‑to‑minutes escalation after a salient provocation. Exclude planned acquisitive crimes (robbery, burglary) and lured/ambush events.
- Event features (must be corroborated by video/911/bodycam/witnesses where available): rapid escalation, disorganized execution, no preparatory staging or post‑event concealment, contemporaneous “saw red/went blank” type statements or autonomic arousal. Any credible evidence of planning or instrumental motive should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentary history (temporality)
- At least two independent, pre‑charge sources documenting stimulus‑bound loss of control or affective instability (e.g., school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile/ED notes of dissociation or intermittent explosive episodes, sleep disruption records).
- One documented developmental exposure likely to impair control systems, dated well before the offense (e.g., childhood blood lead ≥5 µg/dL—preferably repeated or a single ≥10; or documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; or credible FASD risk; or verified severe childhood neglect/abuse). These are supportive of mechanism; they are not themselves exculpatory.

3) Neurocognitive profile (specificity and validity)
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below age‑norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks central to control (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time; Go/No‑Go or antisaccade; an affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), administered by a qualified examiner within ~60–90 days.
- Performance validity: pass at least two independent PVTs (embedded and stand‑alone). Ideally, replicate or obtain cross‑test convergence to mitigate state noise (sleep, meds).
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive—not predatory—aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in the high range), used cautiously.

4) Clinical linkage to the index event
- A structured DSM‑5 diagnosis by a neutral, court‑appointed clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom onset and triggers plausibly mapping onto the index event and anchored to the pre‑offense record.
- Stress physiology (e.g., flattened diurnal or hair cortisol) may be admitted as supportive but should not be outcome‑determinative.

5) Exclusions/alternative cause controls
- Voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Rule out malingering (multiple PVTs; collateral consistency), primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the time, and strong instrumental motives.
- Timing safeguards: rely heavily on pre‑offense records to avoid post‑charge “forensic artifact”; standardize testing conditions; note sleep/medication status.

Gatekeeping and procedure
- Pretrial Daubert hearing keyed to a standardized checklist; require a structured proffer (geocoded exposure histories; certified lab/medical/CPS/school/EPA/HUD/UI records).
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); limit flashy neuroimaging (fMRI/EEG) under Rule 403—admit only if methodologically sound and clearly probative beyond available behavioral measures.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the immediate act.
- Bifurcation to preserve jury focus: phase one on actus reus/mens rea; phase two on dyscontrol excuse if reached. Provide a specialized instruction that poverty or adversity alone is not a defense; the issue is substantial incapacity to conform conduct at the time, causally linked to verified RSB exposures.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medications, legal stress can depress performance and cortisol—seek replication or pre‑offense corroboration.
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple validity checks; beware selective “too bad to be true” deficits.
- Acute intoxication: do not conflate lifetime toxin history (lead) with alcohol/drug effects at the offense.
- Reverse causation/base‑rate neglect: incarceration stress can flatten cortisol; avoid inferring causality from common findings in high‑adversity populations.
- Over‑interpretation of weakly specific measures (Stroop/WCST) and “brain image theater.”

Disposition
- If the excuse is found, order an ESB‑oriented, noncarceral disposition with court supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep remediation, employment supports), with civil commitment reserved for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.
- If the showing falls short of clear‑and‑convincing but is credible (e.g., preponderance), channel it to structured mitigation at sentencing (and, in homicide, MPC‑style EED).

Equity and legitimacy safeguards
- Resource parity for indigent defendants to meet the evidentiary burden, or the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.
- Robust victims’ participation at disposition; protective conditions; periodic judicial review.

Bottom line: With these guardrails—narrow offense domain, corroborated event signature, pre‑offense documentation, valid inhibitory deficits, clinical mapping, and strict exclusions—the attribution is administrable and respects Hart’s fairness limit without opening floodgates or diluting public condemnation of planned or predatory crime.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, could you translate Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle into something a trial court can actually run with? Please propose: (i) a Daubert-style gatekeeping checklist the judge can use at a pretrial hearing (what documentary predicates and tests must be proffered; which disqualifiers end the inquiry; who bears what burden); and (ii) a short, neutral jury instruction defining “reactive dyscontrol” and the clear-and-convincing standard, with a bright-line rule on voluntary intoxication. Limit the doctrine to reactive violent offenses, specify any timing requirements (e.g., testing within 60 days) and a requirement of pre-offense records. Aim for operational clarity a judge could paste into an order.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Short answer: I largely agree with Dr. Chen’s caution. None of the proposed tests or biomarkers time‑stamp dyscontrol; they are, at best, supportive of a mechanism. To reach “clear and convincing” on a dyscontrol excuse, courts should demand tight convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment, with strong gatekeeping and a narrow offense domain (reactive violence). Absent that, the claim should be channeled to MPC‑style EED (in homicide) or to sentencing mitigation.

On specificity and temporality
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) index trait‑like inhibitory weaknesses with moderate specificity; they do not prove loss of control at t0.
- Cortisol profiles and historic BLLs are mechanistically plausible but temporally blunt; they corroborate developmental load, not the instant impairment.
- Thus, event‑level phenomenology (what happened and how) must carry the weight; testing/biomarkers corroborate, they do not decide.

Minimum convergence I would require (all of the following; no single item suffices)
1) Event signature consistent with automatism‑like/reactive dyscontrol
- Acute provocation → seconds/minutes to act; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous observations (“went blank,” “saw red,” marked autonomic arousal), ideally via 911/body‑cam/video. Any meaningful planning or instrumental motive is disqualifying.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, juvenile MH notes, ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation measures (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade error rate, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with intact stand‑alone and embedded performance‑validity tests and reasonable stability across sessions.
- Low‑to‑moderate psychopathic traits (to favor impulsive over predatory aggression).

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to exposures documented pre‑offense, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index act. Biological stress corroboration (e.g., hair cortisol) is supportive but not required.

5) Independent exposure corroboration (at least one)
- Developmental biological insult documented outside litigation: childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or any ≥10), clinically supported IDA/malnutrition, or well‑documented prenatal alcohol/drug exposure; OR documented high‑dose early trauma (substantiated CPS/violent‑event exposure) plus enduring sleep disruption, with collateral records. This is to anchor the mechanism, not to expand eligibility.

And all of these exclusions/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse (mitigation only).
- Negative malingering screens (multiple PVTs), cross‑source consistency, and repeat testing if state confounds are likely (sleep loss, meds).
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures, acute TBI, or clear instrumental motives.
- Testing as early as feasible post‑offense and triangulated with pre‑charge records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Scientific pitfalls to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep deprivation, incarceration stress, medication changes can depress executive performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize and, where possible, repeat.
- Malingering/secondary gain: use multiple validity measures; be wary of selective/extreme deficits.
- Intoxication: do not let chronic toxin history (lead, FASD) be conflated with acute alcohol/stimulant effects at t0.
- Reverse causation: post‑offense stress can generate “abnormal” labs; lean on pre‑offense documentation.
- Over‑reading fMRI/EEG: these are not diagnostic of legal dyscontrol; admit only as background science, not as dispositive proof.
- Base‑rate/selection bias: many disadvantaged defendants will show some deficits; the doctrine must remain for the top tail where mechanism and moment align.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and equality)
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with structured proffer tied to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Notice and standardized templates for documentary proof (medical/CPS/school/EPA–HUD/UI records; geocoded exposure history).
- Limit to reactive violent offenses (and, exceptionally, truly impulsive nonviolent episodes); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense; experts barred from opining on the ultimate legal issue; bifurcation and tailored instructions to protect jury focus.

Disposition
- Where the excuse is found, favor ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision (trauma‑focused care, housing relocation from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep interventions, employment pipelines); civil commitment only if the person remains demonstrably dangerous.

Bottom line
The proposed Stage 2 elements can support a dyscontrol excuse only as a convergent bundle; event‑level evidence is indispensable, testing/biomarkers are corroborative, and exclusions must be enforced. With these constraints, the doctrine will be rare and governable; without them, it risks drift and public‑legitimacy costs. In close cases, the right home is EED or structured mitigation at sentencing, not a full excuse.

Judge Ellery, wearing your evidence-and-administrability hat: taking Santiago’s two-stage gate and Chen’s cautions as given, what is the minimal, court-manageable admissibility framework you would adopt to screen RSB–dyscontrol evidence under Daubert (e.g., required data sources, timing of testing, neutral experts), and can you draft a concise model jury instruction that translates “substantial volitional impairment” into lay terms while making clear that voluntary intoxication does not qualify? Please keep it concrete—think a short checklist for the pretrial hearing and a 6–8 sentence instruction for the jury.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Dr. Chen’s cautions and will sharpen them into an administrable judicial gate. For a dyscontrol excuse to be viable at guilt, Stage 2 must look far more like automatism than like “general impulsivity.” Event signature carries the weight; labs and tests corroborate rather than prove.

1) What the tools can and cannot do
- Neurocognitive batteries (SSRT/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop) with performance‑validity tests are probative of trait‑level inhibitory weakness; they are not temporally precise. WCST adds little to the volitional-control question; downweight it.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic BLLs support mechanism and temporality (developmental insult) but are nonspecific for the moment of offense.
- I would exclude fMRI/advanced imaging at guilt as unduly prejudicial relative to probative value; at most, allow in mitigation.

2) Minimum convergence I would require (clear and convincing)
You need all of A–D; E is strongly preferred but I would not make it jurisdiction‑wide mandatory given record‑access disparities.

A. Event‑level signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Salient provocation; escalation within seconds to a very few minutes; no luring or instrumental setup; disorganized, short‑lived episode; immediate post‑event confusion/dissociation.
- Contemporaneous corroboration (any two): 911/body‑cam/video; neutral eyewitness; spontaneous utterances describing “blanking out/seeing red”; autonomic signs (tremor, pallor, hyperventilation) noted by third parties.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline, ED/clinic notes, juvenile files) showing episodic explosive reactivity or dissociation under stress. This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation concerns.

C. Neuropsychological evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), with intact effort indices (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs) and either repeat testing stability or cross‑task convergence.
- Low–moderate psychopathic traits to fit a reactive, not predatory, pattern.

D. Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptoms and triggers that plausibly explain the instant episode; ideally supported by hair or multi‑day salivary cortisol showing chronic dysregulation (supportive, not required).

E. Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism (preferred)
- Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (or a prior ≥10), or documented early malnutrition/iron‑deficiency anemia, or credible FASD risk—established in pre‑litigation records.

3) Disqualifiers and alternative‑cause controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver (alcohol/stimulants) defeats the excuse; mixed cases require proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Evidence of planning/goal‑directedness: weapon retrieval from another location after cooling time, luring, concealment, coordinated group retaliation.
- Primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB exposures (that is a different doctrine).
- Malingering: fail any of multiple PVTs; “too‑bad‑to‑be‑true” profiles; inconsistencies across sessions/collaterals.
- State effects: acute sleep loss/legal stress—standardize testing conditions; lean on pre‑offense records.

4) Procedural guardrails
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tied to a standardized proffer checklist; court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology/psychiatry/environmental health.
- Notice and documentary provenance (school/medical/CPS/EPA‑HUD/911). No fMRI at guilt; cortisol/HRV admissible only as corroboration with proper foundations.
- Offense domain: presumptively limited to reactive violent offenses. Planned acquisitive crime is out.
- Burden: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

5) Jury management and disposition
- Bifurcate where available; specialized instruction that this is an excuse (no moral endorsement), akin to automatism. If established, ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions with risk management; civil commitment only where statutory criteria (mental disease plus dangerousness) are met.

Bottom line: event‑moment evidence plus pre‑offense documentation is indispensable; testing and biomarkers can corroborate but not substitute. This keeps the doctrine narrow, honors Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit, and addresses administrability and equity concerns that, in my experience, determine whether such a rule survives contact with real dockets.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, on administrability: would you formalize Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate into an admissibility rule? Please be concrete. What should a Daubert/Kumho pretrial hearing require, what burden should apply, and would you confine the doctrine to reactive violent offenses? Most importantly, can you sketch a short model jury instruction that defines (i) “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and (ii) the causation link to the instant act, and say whether you’d require bifurcation to keep liability and disposition separate.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

At guilt, we must anchor any dyscontrol excuse in what mattered at the moment of the act: did the defendant have a fair opportunity to conform? None of the proposed tests or biomarkers time‑stamp volitional failure. They can, however, corroborate a narrow, event‑centered showing when aligned and when alternative drivers are excluded. Administrability and error costs counsel a tight bundle, clear exclusions, and neutral gatekeeping.

Are the proposed measures specific/temporally sensitive?
- Neurocognitive tasks (stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go; antisaccade; affective Stroop) are the best behavioral proxies for inhibitory control. They are state‑sensitive and not specific to the offense moment; they support mechanism, not timing.
- WCST is relatively nonspecific to inhibition; I would downweight it.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic BLLs index chronic load and developmental insult; they are probative on plausibility and dose–response, not on whether control failed in the instant.
- Psychiatric diagnoses (PTSD, IED) help map symptoms to triggers but can be over‑extended post hoc.
- Bottom line: no single measure suffices; event‑level phenomenology and pre‑offense records carry the most weight. Testing and biomarkers are corroborative.

Minimum converging bundle (clear‑and‑convincing) for a narrowly tailored, reactive‑violence excuse
Require all of A–D and G; require at least one of E or F. Failure of any disqualifier defeats the excuse.

A. Event signature (contemporaneously corroborated)
- Near‑immediate escalation (seconds to a few minutes) after a salient provocation/threat.
- Disorganized execution; absence of luring/preparation/concealment; behavior consistent with confusion (e.g., remaining at scene, immediate 911 call).
- Corroboration by witnesses/video/911 audio/body‑cam of “blanking out,” autonomic arousal.

B. Pre‑offense documentation (nonforensic)
- School/juvenile/medical/CPS records predating the offense evidencing episodic, stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (explosive outbursts, dissociation) or longstanding sleep disruption.
- Not created for litigation.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity safeguards
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), with intact effort indices (multiple PVTs) and stability across sessions or cross‑task convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive rather than predatory aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R), used cautiously.

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑instrument diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), with symptom content and identified triggers plausibly explaining the index act; anchored to exposures documented before the offense.

E. Objective exposure biomarker (developmental insult)
- Childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated or a prior ≥10) OR documented FASD risk OR iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive windows, independently recorded, plus a plausible bridge to current executive deficits.

F. Chronic stress physiology (supportive, not required)
- Hair cortisol flattening or low resting high‑frequency HRV consistent with impaired affect regulation, recognizing confounds.

G. Exclusion of alternative proximate causes
- No substantial voluntary intoxication driving the behavior; no clear instrumental motive; no primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; no acute TBI at the time; malingering reasonably excluded (multiple validity checks, collateral consistency).

Per se disqualifiers (“kill switches”)
- Evidence of planning (weapon staging, luring), cool‑down interval permitting reflection, concealment/flight indicative of instrumental aims.
- BAC/drug levels consistent with intoxication as the proximate cause (absent involuntary ingestion).
- Predatory/acquisitive context (e.g., robbery) rather than affective/reactive violence.

Gatekeeping and instructions to contain error costs
- Pretrial Daubert/Frye hearing with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Standardized documentation (geocoded exposure history; school/medical/CPS/EPA/lead lab records).
- Testing standardized (sleep/meds/caffeine) and, where feasible, repeated; administrators blinded to case theory to reduce demand characteristics.
- Pattern instruction: the jury may consider RSB evidence only if it finds the defendant was in an acute, involuntary state of dyscontrol that eliminated a fair opportunity to conform; mere anger, poverty, or diminished self‑control is insufficient.

Scientific pitfalls courts should watch for
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, incarceration stress can depress performance and flatten cortisol; favor pre‑offense records and replicate testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple performance‑validity tests, cross‑source corroboration, and beware “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Acute intoxication: distinguishes historical toxin exposure from alcohol/drug impairment at offense; the latter should generally defeat the excuse.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑charge stress can create the appearance of dysregulation; weight contemporaneous/event‑level evidence and historic records most heavily.
- Base‑rate/false‑positive risk: the more elements required and the more they converge, the lower the error risk; resist over‑reliance on any single abnormality.
- Over‑interpretation of imaging: fMRI/EEG lack forensic specificity and should be treated, at most, as ancillary.

Narrow scope
- Limit to truly reactive violent offenses; do not extend to planned acquisitive crime.
- Maintain a clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense and bifurcation to preserve juror focus and legitimacy.

With those guardrails, Stage 2 can, in rare cases, justifiably support an involuntary‑rage/dyscontrol excuse. In the far larger remainder, the same evidence should inform structured mitigation at sentencing, where error costs are lower and public protection can be addressed through ESB‑oriented conditions.

### Speaker: Host

Assume we adopt a narrow dyscontrol excuse along the Santiago/Chen lines. From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, what would your gatekeeping order and model jury instruction look like? Please specify: (i) the pretrial standard (e.g., Daubert‑style reliability plus clear‑and‑convincing proffer) and the concrete findings the judge must make before the jury hears it; (ii) any categorical offense limitation (e.g., reactive violent offenses only); and (iii) concise instruction language defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause” that a lay jury can apply without over‑excusing impulsive but voluntary violence.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Judge Ellery (Ret.):

Bottom line. Stage 2 must be event‑anchored and mechanism‑plausible. None of the proposed tests or biomarkers is dispositive or time‑stamped; they are admissible only as corroboration of a reactive, unplanned episode where inhibitory control was substantially degraded. If we keep that hierarchy clear, this can be governable.

What I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard (all must be shown):

1) Event signature (primary weight)
- Rapid escalation after a salient trigger; no luring or weapon staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions of dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”), corroborated where possible by 911/body‑cam/video or multiple witnesses.
- Absence of concealment behaviors or instrumental motive. Any meaningful planning or post‑event calculation should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (temporal anchoring)
- Non‑forensic records predating the offense evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control: school discipline/IEP notes, pediatric or ED notes, juvenile files, prior employer or probation reports describing explosive reactivity or dissociation. This is the best antidote to reverse‑causation and “forensic artifact.”

3) Neurocognitive findings with validity (supportive, not decisive)
- At least two performance‑valid, independent measures ≥1.5 SD impaired on domains directly tied to inhibition/affect regulation (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time; Go/No‑Go or antisaccade; an affective variant such as emotional Go/No‑Go/Stroop). Include delay‑discounting if available.
- Multiple performance‑validity tests (embedded and stand‑alone) with intact effort. Downweight WCST; it is nonspecific. fMRI/EEG should not be determinative and, absent exceptional circumstances, should be excluded to avoid overinterpretation.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event (supportive)
- A structured‑interview diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) whose symptom content and triggers plausibly explain the index episode, tied to pre‑offense exposures. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol) are at most corroborative.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism (supportive)
- Independent, pre‑litigation evidence of at least one relevant exposure (e.g., repeated childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, documented FASD risk, iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive periods) that plausibly contributes to the measured executive deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/exclusions satisfied:
- No substantial voluntary intoxication as the proximate driver. A bright‑line presumption against the excuse with high BAC or acute stimulant intoxication is prudent; the defense may rebut only with strong proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- No primary psychosis/mania/TBI as the immediate cause (those are different doctrines).
- Low‑to‑moderate psychopathy/antisocial trait profile (to distinguish reactive from predatory aggression), recognizing the limitations and potential bias of such instruments.
- Consistency across test sessions and informant reports; no evidence of malingering.

On the proposed tools’ probative value
- Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go/antisaccade: most on‑point but state‑sensitive (sleep, anxiety, meds). Require standardized testing conditions and, where feasible, retest or cross‑task convergence.
- Stroop: useful in affective variants; classic color‑word Stroop is nonspecific.
- WCST: minimize weight.
- Hair cortisol: better than single‑day saliva for chronic load but still nonspecific; treat as supportive only.
- Historic BLLs: probative of developmental harm when elevations occurred in early childhood; they strengthen plausibility when paired with executive deficits but do not speak to the moment.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication changes can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Prefer pre‑offense records; standardize and, where possible, repeat testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple PVTs and look for cross‑source consistency. Be wary of selective “too bad to be true” patterns.
- Acute intoxication: keep separate from lifetime toxin history; voluntary intoxication generally defeats an excuse.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: give greatest weight to documents created before the offense (school, medical, CPS, housing/EPA).
- Measurement equity: ensure norms appropriate to age/education/language; be cautious with PCL‑R given known biases.

Gatekeeping and process (to keep the fence tight)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing limited to a structured proffer on the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts in forensic neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (geocoded exposure history; lab records; school/CPS/housing/UI files).
- Limit the doctrine to affective/reactive violent offenses (and, rarely, truly impulsive nonviolent bursts). Planned acquisitive crimes should be presumptively out.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.

Jury guidance
- Special instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” (akin to an inability to conform conduct, not mere anger or provocation), emphasizing that deprivation alone is never enough; impairment must have been present and causally operative at the time.

Disposition
- If the excuse succeeds, channel to ESB‑oriented, noncarceral supervision (trauma care, stable housing away from criminogenic contexts, nutrition/sleep stabilization, employment supports), with civil commitment available only if the person remains dangerous under ordinary civil standards. That protects the public while preserving the doctrine’s legitimacy.

With these constraints, the defense should be rare and largely limited to the top tail where history, mechanism, and moment genuinely converge—consistent with Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit and with the administrability concerns that, in my experience, sustain public confidence.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five-pillar attribution as givens, how would you operationalize this at the bench to keep it both fair and administrable? Please be concrete on two points: (1) the pretrial gatekeeping rubric you would apply at a Daubert-style hearing (what documentary showings and expert proffers must be present to reach a jury, and what categorical exclusions—e.g., planned acquisitive crime, substantial voluntary intoxication—you would enforce); and (2) the precise jury instruction you’d give if it clears the gate (elements the defense must prove by clear and convincing evidence, how to weigh event-level “reactive” signatures versus neurocognitive findings, and a directive on alternative-cause exclusion). If you favor special verdict questions or bifurcation, sketch that structure briefly. Keep it tightly rule-governed to minimize error costs and protect legitimacy.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m largely with Dr. Chen on the science: none of these instruments time‑stamp control failure; they only make it more or less plausible that, in a narrow class of reactive events, volition was substantially degraded. That has two implications for courts: (1) tighten the doctrinal channel; and (2) demand convergence, not single‑strand proof.

1) Channel the doctrine
- Reserve a complete excuse for “involuntary‑rage automatism” only: conduct not the product of the actor’s effort or determination (think MPC §2.01(2) language), in sudden, reactive violence. Everything short of that belongs in MPC‑style EED (homicide) or sentencing mitigation.
- Limit applicability to affective/reactive violent offenses with immediacy; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crimes and cases with staging/cover‑up.
- Place the burden on the defense, clear and convincing, after a Daubert‑style gatekeeping hearing; use court‑appointed neutral experts in neuropsychology/psychiatry/environmental health; require equal funding for indigent defendants.

2) What counts as “clear and convincing” convergence
No single test or biomarker suffices. I would require a bundle that looks like this (all five pillars; any disqualifier below defeats):

A. Event signature
- Near‑instant escalation after a salient provocation; disorganized execution; contemporaneous evidence of dissociation (“went blank,” “saw red”), ideally via body‑cam/911 audio/eyewitness. Any luring, weapon staging, concealment, or flight to avoid detection is a strong counter‑indicator.

B. Pre‑offense documentary history
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (school discipline/IEPs for explosive behavior; juvenile mental‑health notes; prior ED visits; documented chronic sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and guards against reverse causation.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD impaired (e.g., stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective Stroop), plus an impulsive choice measure (delay discounting); multiple performance‑validity tests intact; stability across sessions or cross‑test convergence; low–moderate PCL‑R or equivalent trait measures supporting an impulsive (not predatory) style.

D. Psychiatric/physiological linkage
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to documented adversities, with symptom content/triggers plausibly mapping to the index event. Chronic stress corroborators (hair cortisol flattening; low HF‑HRV) are supportive, not determinative.

E. Objective developmental exposure(s)
- Independently documented biological insult(s) pre‑dating the deficits: childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL (preferably repeated, or a ≥10), early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition markers, or credible FASD risk; plus geocoded residence/school/housing records establishing cumulative deprivation.

Disqualifiers/controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication proximate to the offense; primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB; acute TBI at the scene; strong instrumental motive; malingering (failed PVTs, “too bad to be true” profiles); testing conducted only post‑charge without triangulation to pre‑offense records.

3) Pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, medication changes, and incarceration stress can depress executive scores and flatten cortisol; standardize testing conditions, repeat when feasible, and anchor to pre‑offense records.
- Secondary gain/malingering: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity indices; look for consistency across sessions and informants.
- “Brain overclaim”: exclude showy but weak neuroscience (e.g., fMRI images) under Daubert/Rule 403 unless tied to accepted diagnostic utility.
- Causal leap: childhood lead or ACEs are background risk, not a license; the question is whether those exposures substantially degraded inhibitory control in this defendant at this time.

4) Bifurcation and instructions
- Use bifurcated trials. In phase two, if the court admits the defense, give a tightly drafted instruction: the jury may return a verdict of not guilty by reason of automatism only if it finds that, as a result of cumulative environmental deprivation and associated insults, the defendant experienced an acute episode in which the act was not the product of his effort or determination. Otherwise, consider EED (in homicide) or proceed to sentencing where RSB factors mitigate.

5) Disposition
- On an automatism acquittal: no carceral punishment; if dangerousness persists, use civil mechanisms; otherwise, ESB‑oriented conditions (housing relocation, trauma‑focused treatment, nutrition/sleep interventions, job supports) under court supervision. This protects victims and public safety without sending the expressive message of justification.

Bottom line: the Santiago/Chen framework is about as administrable as this gets, but courts should confine the complete excuse to the rare, well‑corroborated “non‑volitional act” and route the remainder to EED or structured mitigation keyed to verified deprivation indicators. This preserves Hart’s “fair opportunity” limit, manages error costs, and keeps the gate from blowing open.

### Speaker: Host

From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, how would you structure the court’s Rule 702/Daubert gatekeeping for a dyscontrol‑based RSB excuse? Please be concrete: propose a pretrial checklist the judge should apply (what must be documented, what tests/records are admissible, what disqualifiers bar the claim), whether to require court‑appointed neutral experts, the standard of proof for the proffer, and a short model jury instruction that cabins the excuse to reactive violence and clarifies that voluntary intoxication defeats it.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Dr. Chen has it about right: none of these instruments time‑stamps loss of control. They are neither specific nor temporally precise standing alone. If we are to let them through the courthouse door, they must come as a tight, pre‑specified bundle that aligns mechanism, history, and the moment, and we must cabin the doctrine to the rare, reactive case.

What I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing burden

Gatekeeping (pretrial)
- Offense domain: limit to genuinely reactive violence (seconds to minutes after a salient provocation). Presumptive exclusion for planned acquisitive crime, luring, staging, or other instrumental conduct.
- Notice and Daubert hearing with court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health). Defense resources for indigent defendants must be provided or the motion is denied without prejudice.

Minimum converging pillars (all required)
1) Event signature
- Near‑immediate escalation after a concrete trigger; disorganized execution; lack of concealment; contemporaneous descriptions of “blanking out/seeing red” and autonomic arousal (911/body‑cam/video if available). Any significant planning or post‑event instrumental behavior defeats this pillar.

2) Pre‑offense, nonforensic history
- School/juvenile/medical records predating the offense that document stimulus‑bound dyscontrol (explosive reactivity, dissociation, IEPs for behavior, ED visits for rage episodes, chronic sleep disruption tied to environmental stress). This addresses temporality and the “forensic artifact” problem.

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal/SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go/No‑Go or affective Stroop), administered within 30–90 days, with multiple performance‑validity indices intact and consistency across sessions/tests. WCST is ancillary; do not anchor on it. Include a delay‑discounting measure if feasible. Trait psychopathy in the low–moderate range (used cautiously) to support a reactive, not predatory, style.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured clinical diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, tied to documented exposures and with symptom content plausibly explaining the offense (triggers, dissociation). Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol over 3 months) are supportive but not determinative.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent, historical documentation of at least one biological insult during sensitive periods (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL—ideally repeated—or a ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; prenatal alcohol exposure) that plausibly contributes to present executive deficits.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Exclude primary psychosis/mania (unless a different doctrine is squarely invoked), acute TBI at the event, malingering (fail any of several PVTs), or strong instrumental motive.
- Prefer pre‑charge documentation; be alert to reverse causation (post‑offense incarceration stress flattening cortisol, transient executive depression).

Scientific pitfalls for courts to police
- State–trait confounds: sleep loss, acute stress, meds. Standardize testing; corroborate with pre‑offense records; consider repeat testing.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity checks; scrutinize “too bad to be true” profiles; demand cross‑source consistency.
- Base‑rate and stacking fallacies: several weak, nonspecific findings do not become strong simply by aggregation. The pillars must independently align with the same mechanism and moment.
- Neuro “bells and whistles”: exclude fMRI and similar imaging for dispositive purposes; admit, if at all, only as background science with a limiting instruction.
- Misuse of trait tools: PCL‑R and the like are blunt; use only to help distinguish reactive from predatory patterns, not to label “bad character.”

How to present this to a jury (and keep legitimacy)
- Bifurcation: try guilt first. If the jury finds the elements and rejects perfect self‑defense/EED, move to a special excuse phase with constrained evidentiary scope and a focused instruction (e.g., “You may consider evidence of involuntary rage automatism only if you find that, due to cumulative deprivation and biological insult, the defendant experienced a transient state of involuntary dyscontrol at the time of the act. Mere anger, poverty, or intoxication do not qualify.”).
- Burden: clear and convincing on both substantial degradation of inhibitory control and substantial contribution to the act.
- Neutral experts; standardized exhibit templates (school/CPS/medical/EPA/UI records; geocoded exposure history) to avoid “culture shopping.”

Disposition
- If excuse is found, do not default to the street. Order ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma‑focused care; housing relocation from criminogenic contexts; nutrition/sleep interventions; job pathways) under court supervision, with periodic dangerousness reviews. Civil commitment remains available where lawful criteria are met. Victims’ input and no‑contact safeguards are integral.

Bottom line
Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑2 architecture is directionally sound if we (i) tighten the test battery to tasks that actually assay inhibition under affect, (ii) insist on pre‑offense documentation, and (iii) treat biological markers as plausibility enhancers, not proof. With these guardrails, the doctrine will apply to a very small slice of reactive violence and will be administrable. Outside that narrow lane, I would steer RSB evidence to MPC‑style EED in homicide and to structured mitigation at sentencing keyed to verified deprivation indicators.

### Speaker: Time check

You have 15 minutes remaining. Please start to wrap up the discussion.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, taking Prof. Santiago’s Stage‑1/Stage‑2 framework and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle with disqualifiers as given, sketch the legal architecture you’d actually implement: (i) the pretrial gatekeeping standard and hearing (what must the defense proffer under Daubert/Kumho, and in what documentary form); (ii) a model jury instruction defining “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and the clear‑and‑convincing burden, including how you’d direct jurors to weigh event‑signature evidence and to disregard voluntary intoxication; (iii) any offense‑domain limits and whether you’d bifurcate; and (iv) Rule 403 tools to prevent mini‑trials and undue prejudice. Please be concrete about the exact thresholds and the use of neutral court‑appointed experts to mitigate resource disparity.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

The short answer is that none of the proposed instruments is, standing alone, specific or time‑stamped enough to prove a loss of inhibitory control “at the moment.” They are, at best, trait‑leaning indicators that can make a reactive‑dyscontrol account plausible when they line up with the event signature and pre‑offense history. Used that way, they can satisfy a clear‑and‑convincing standard in a narrow band of cases.

How I would assess Stage 2, from an admissibility/administrability lens

- Specificity and temporality. Stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go and antisaccade tasks track inhibition better than Stroop or WCST, but all are susceptible to state noise (sleep, meds, motivation) and are not moment‑specific. Cortisol (salivary or hair) is a chronic‑load marker, not a time‑of‑offense gauge; historic BLLs speak to developmental insult, not the immediate episode. So the “moment” must be inferred primarily from the event’s phenomenology (reactive, disorganized, rapid escalation) plus pre‑offense records of similar dyscontrol; the tests/biomarkers corroborate mechanism.

- Weighting. I would downweight WCST and generic Stroop; prefer stop‑signal, antisaccade, and an affective inhibition task. fMRI should rarely, if ever, come in; it is low probative/high confusion under Rule 403.

A minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing; defendant’s burden)

All of the following:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Proximate provocation; seconds‑to‑minutes escalation; no luring or preparation; disorganized execution; contemporaneous witness/video/911 descriptions of “blanking,” marked autonomic arousal, or dissociation. Any substantial planning/cover‑up is presumptively disqualifying.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEP/discipline for explosive behavior, juvenile mental‑health notes of dissociation/IED, ED visits for rage episodes, sleep disruption tied to neighborhood violence). This addresses temporality and reduces reverse‑causation claims.

3) Neurocognitive evidence with validity
- ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., stop‑signal reaction time, antisaccade error rate, affective Go‑No‑Go or affective Stroop), with multiple performance‑validity tests passed and either test–retest stability or cross‑task convergence. Include a choice‑impulsivity measure (delay discounting) as supporting evidence. Avoid overreliance on WCST or general Stroop.

4) Clinical linkage that maps to the index event
- A structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder) by a qualified clinician, anchored in pre‑offense exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger/response pattern in the offense. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol) may support but should not be required.

5) Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism
- At least one documented biological exposure independent of litigation (e.g., childhood BLLs ≥5 µg/dL, ideally repeated or a prior ≥10; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during sensitive periods; well‑documented FASD risk), plus a plausible link to current inhibition deficits.

And all of the following exclusions/safeguards:

- Voluntary intoxication proximate to the offense defeats the excuse absent persuasive proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of the substance.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs; consistency across sessions; collateral informants; be skeptical of “too bad to be true” profiles.
- Alternative cause exclusion: rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless separately litigated), acute TBI at the scene, and clear instrumental motives.
- Timing controls: testing as early as practicable (within ~60–90 days), standardized conditions (sleep, caffeine, meds), and reliance on pre‑offense records to avoid “forensic artifact.”

Scientific/pedagogical pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds. Acute sleep loss/anxiety can depress performance and flatten cortisol; standardize, repeat, and corroborate with pre‑offense documentation or actigraphy.
- Reverse causation. Post‑arrest stress can mimic chronic stress profiles; hair cortisol offers a pre‑offense window; historic pediatric labs and school records are better anchors.
- Base‑rate neglect. High ACEs and low SES are common; the doctrine must insist on the full convergence, not “poverty plus bad test.”
- Criterion contamination. Experts inferring dyscontrol because they were told to expect it; require blinded scoring where feasible and court‑appointed neutrals.
- PCL‑R misuse. Use cautiously and mainly to exclude predatory profiles; avoid overinterpretation.
- Imaging theater. Exclude or strictly limit fMRI/EEG absent a tight, peer‑accepted linkage; the risk of undue weight is high (Rule 403).

Institutional guardrails (to keep this governable)

- Pretrial Rule 104(a)/Daubert hearing keyed to a checklist like the above; defense bears clear‑and‑convincing burden on impairment and causation; appoint neutral neuropsych/psychiatry/environmental‑health experts.
- Notice and standardized documentary templates (medical/CPS/school/EPA‑HUD/UE records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Offense limitation: reactive violent offenses (and perhaps rare, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptive exclusion for planned acquisitive crime.
- Jury instruction emphasizing: not general poverty; not mere correlation; impairment must have substantially degraded inhibitory control at the time; voluntary intoxication defeats; sympathy or social critique is not a basis for acquittal.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the gate will be one‑way.

Fit with existing doctrine

- If the bundle fails to clear the gate, EED (MPC §210.3) in homicide and sentencing mitigation remain appropriate channels.
- Where it clears, disposition should be ESB‑oriented (trauma therapy, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep, employment), with civil commitment only for those who remain demonstrably dangerous.

Bottom line

The Santiago/Chen architecture is directionally sound if we insist on tight convergence: event signature + pre‑offense dyscontrol + valid inhibition deficits + documented developmental insult + clinical mapping, along with robust exclusions. That keeps the excuse rare, focused on genuine reactive automatism/dyscontrol, and consistent with Hart’s fairness limit, while preserving administrability and public legitimacy.

### Speaker: Time check

You have 15 minutes remaining. Please start to wrap up the discussion.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, assume the jurisdiction recognizes a narrow dyscontrol excuse. Drawing on Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence requirements, please outline three concrete elements: (1) the pretrial admissibility framework you would codify (party burdens, proffer contents, Daubert factors, appointment of neutral experts, and an offense‑domain limit to reactive violence); (2) a short model jury instruction that defines “substantial degradation of inhibitory control” and “substantial contributing cause,” and that flags disqualifiers (voluntary intoxication, planning/cover‑up, malingering/performance invalidity); and (3) where you would set the error‑cost balance (false‑positive vs false‑negative risk) and why, given public‑legitimacy and administrability concerns. Please be precise about thresholds and language you’d use in a pattern instruction.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Bottom line: none of the Stage 2 tools can time‑stamp loss of control; standing alone they are not specific enough. Used together, under tight gatekeeping, they can support a clear‑and‑convincing inference of substantial reactive dyscontrol in a narrow slice of cases. The court’s job is to demand alignment across history, mechanism, and the moment, and to police alternative explanations.

What I would require (clear and convincing; “highly probable”) before the jury hears a dyscontrol excuse

- Event‑level signature (indispensable)
  - Acute provocation followed by seconds–minutes escalation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment.
  - Contemporaneous corroboration (911/body‑cam/video; witnesses describing “went blank/seeing red,” marked autonomic arousal). If the record shows planning or instrumental motive, stop here.

- Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol (indispensable)
  - Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound control failures (school discipline/IEPs for explosive reactivity, juvenile mental‑health notes, prior ED visits for rage/dissociation, sleep disruption).
  - This addresses temporality and guards against “forensic artifact.”

- Neurocognitive profile with validity (indispensable)
  - At least two independent tasks directly tied to inhibition/affect regulation ≥1.5 SD below norms (e.g., stop‑signal/SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity tests and either replication or cross‑task convergence. WCST gets little weight; it’s not mechanism‑specific.
  - Include a measure of impulsive choice (delay discounting) if available. Low–moderate psychopathic trait scores support a reactive, not predatory, phenotype.

- Clinical linkage that maps to the index event (indispensable)
  - Structured DSM‑5 diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented exposures and with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the episode.
  - Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair‑cortisol over prior 3 months) are supportive, not determinative.

- Objective developmental insult consistent with mechanism (strongly preferred)
  - Independently documented childhood exposure likely to impair prefrontal control (elevated BLLs during sensitive windows; iron‑deficiency/malnutrition; well‑documented FASD risk). These do not prove momentary impairment but strengthen causal plausibility when paired with current deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls

- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity measures; consistency across sessions; collateral informants.
- Alternative primary causes: rule out frank psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, or clear instrumental motive.
- Timing: test as early as practicable (ideally within 30–60 days) and lean on pre‑offense records to avoid reverse‑causation from incarceration stress.

Are the proposed measures “specific” enough?

- Stop‑signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the best of an imperfect lot for inhibitory control. Stroop (especially affective variants) adds value; WCST adds little. All are state‑sensitive; hence replication and validity checks.
- Cortisol is noisy; a single diurnal profile is weak. Hair‑cortisol provides a 2–3 month window and is better for chronic load, but is still only supportive. Historic BLLs are historically probative (if elevated in early childhood) but not momentary indicators.

Scientific pitfalls courts should police

- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, meds, pain, and legal stress depress performance and cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; repeat or corroborate; use actigraphy or collateral sleep data where feasible.
- Malingering and coached performance: robust PVTs and cross‑task consistency are essential.
- Acute intoxication conflation: alcohol and stimulants degrade inhibition; voluntary use generally is non‑exculpatory.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑charge stress can flatten cortisol and impair testing; lean on pre‑charge records.
- Base‑rate and ecological validity: lab tasks predict group‑level tendencies better than a specific moment; the event signature and pre‑offense history must carry most of the weight.
- Over‑reliance on neuroimaging: I would exclude fMRI for this purpose under Rule 403/702; its courtroom “glow” outstrips its individual diagnostic value.

Procedural guardrails (administrability and fairness)

- Pretrial Daubert/Rule 702 hearing with a structured proffer tied to the elements above; appoint neutral court experts (neuropsych, psychiatry, environmental health) to reduce partisanship.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden on the defense to show (i) substantially degraded inhibitory control and (ii) that this degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Limit the domain: reactive interpersonal violence; presumptively exclude planned acquisitive offenses.
- Bifurcation and special interrogatories: where the defense is sent to the jury, use focused instructions and special findings on impairment and causation to preserve clarity and appellate review.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine skews access.

Disposition if met

- For the rare case that clears this gate, I favor noncarceral ESB conditions under court supervision (trauma‑focused therapy, housing relocation, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines), with civil commitment only if dangerousness persists. Absent this showing, MPC‑style EED in homicide and structured sentencing mitigation keyed to verified deprivation/insult remain the proper channels.

This bundle keeps us within Hart’s fairness limit—no punishment without a fair opportunity to comply—while containing error costs and floodgates risks that worry courts and the public.

### Speaker: Host

Given Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage gate and Dr. Chen’s five‑pillar bundle, what concrete procedural architecture would you adopt to make this administrable without confusing juries or exacerbating inequality—e.g., the precise burden of proof, timing and scope of a Daubert‑style pretrial hearing, use of court‑appointed neutral experts, and the language of a short, pattern jury instruction defining “substantial impairment of inhibitory control” for the instant offense? Please be specific about what you would (and would not) allow into the guilt phase.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I’m broadly aligned with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage structure and Dr. Chen’s cautions. Nothing we have is a time‑stamped “off switch” for will. Courts should demand convergence across history, mechanism, and the moment, with tight gatekeeping and narrow offense coverage.

What I would require to meet a clear‑and‑convincing standard

Judge’s pretrial gate (Daubert/Frye hearing; defense bears C&C):

1) Event signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Provocation-to-violence latency measured in seconds or a very few minutes.
- No weapon pre‑positioning, luring, pursuit over distance, or concealment.
- Disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions of “blanking out/seeing red,” autonomic arousal; ideally corroborated by video/911/bodycam or neutral witnesses.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound outbursts or dissociation (school IEP/discipline; juvenile/ED notes; prior CPS/clinical entries; sleep disruption).
- This addresses temporality and counters “forensic artifact.”

3) Neurocognitive profile with validity
- At least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks ≥1.5 SD impaired (e.g., stop‑signal/Go‑No‑Go with SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go‑No‑Go/Stroop), plus an impulsive choice index (delay discounting), all with multiple performance‑validity tests and, where feasible, re‑test or cross‑test convergence.
- Downweight WCST; it’s non‑specific. Do not rely on a single task.
- Trait screen consistent with reactive (not predatory) aggression (e.g., low–moderate PCL‑R).

4) Objective exposure/biological insult consistent with mechanism
- Independent documentation predating the offense of at least one: childhood blood‑lead history (≥5 µg/dL; stronger if ≥10 or repeated), iron‑deficiency/malnutrition during development, well‑documented FASD risk, or verified prenatal substance exposure; plus geocoded environmental records (lead orders; high‑violence tracts).
- Stress biology (hair cortisol flattening; low resting HF‑HRV) may support chronic load but is not required and never dispositive.

5) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) tied to the documented exposures, with symptom content plausibly explaining the trigger and dissociation in this event.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; mixed cases require proof of baseline dyscontrol independent of substances.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at the scene, or clear instrumental motive.
- Robust malingering safeguards (embedded and stand‑alone PVTs, consistency across sessions, informant collateral).
- Testing conditions standardized (sleep, meds, caffeine) and as early as feasible; lean on pre‑offense records to avoid reverse causation from post‑arrest stress.

Procedural guardrails (administrability/equality)
- Offense domain: presumptively limited to sudden, reactive violent offenses; planned acquisitive crime excluded.
- Neutral court‑appointed experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); party experts allowed but no single expert carries the day.
- Standardized proffer forms (medical labs, CPS, school, housing/EPA/HUD, UI; geocoded history).
- Notice requirement; bifurcated trial with a specialized instruction.
- Resource parity orders for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

Jury instruction (if the judge opens the gate)
- The question is not whether the defendant was deprived, but whether, as a result of that deprivation and related insults, his capacity to conform his conduct was substantially impaired at the time of the act. General hardship, anger, or grievance is insufficient. Voluntary intoxication does not qualify.

Scientific pitfalls to flag
- State–trait confounds (sleep loss, medication changes, acute stress) depress task performance and cortisol; mitigate with standardization and corroboration.
- Over‑interpretation of biomarkers (fMRI, EEG) without clinical utility; admit only as supportive, not determinative, if methodology passes Daubert.
- Coaching/symptom inflation; require multiple validity indices and collateral records.
- Alternative explanations (instrumental motive, staging) should presumptively defeat the claim.

Disposition
- If excused, use ESB‑oriented, noncarceral conditions (trauma treatment, housing relocation from criminogenic areas, nutrition/sleep interventions, job pipelines) under court supervision; civil commitment only for those who remain demonstrably dangerous. In homicide where criteria are not met, MPC‑style EED remains the right partial mitigation. Otherwise, RSB belongs at sentencing, tied to verified deprivation indicators.

Why this stays narrow
- Requiring tight alignment of (1) event‑level reactivity, (2) pre‑offense dyscontrol records, (3) validated executive deficits, (4) a documented developmental insult, and (5) a diagnosis that maps to the trigger will confine relief to a small fraction of cases. This honors Hart’s fair‑opportunity limit while preserving public legitimacy and victim protection.

### Speaker: Host

Judge Ellery, wearing your administrability hat, suppose a jurisdiction wanted to codify a narrow RSB–dyscontrol excuse consistent with Prof. Santiago’s two-stage gate and Dr. Chen’s convergence bundle. How would you draft the rule and trial architecture to make this workable? Please be concrete: (1) elements the defense must prove (including a definition of “substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of offense”); (2) disqualifiers (e.g., voluntary intoxication, planning, predatory motive); (3) the pretrial gate (Daubert-style hearing, neutral experts, documentary thresholds); (4) whether to bifurcate and the precise jury instruction you would give in the guilt phase; and (5) the verdict form/options (complete excuse vs. partial mitigation) and disposition (ESB conditions vs. civil commitment). Also flag any wording you’d use to forestall ‘affluenza’-style misuse and to cabin the doctrine to reactive violence without stereotyping poverty.

---

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

Professor Santiago’s Stage 2 focuses the inquiry where it belongs—on whether inhibitory control was substantially degraded at the moment of the offense—and her proposed elements are broadly sound. But none of the listed measures is temporally precise or specific enough on its own to carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden. The only administrable way to make this work is convergence: the mechanism, the defendant’s pre‑offense history, and the event signature must line up, while obvious alternative drivers are ruled out. Courts should build that into a tight gate with neutral expertise and standardized proffers.

Are the proposed tools sufficient in principle?
- Neurocognitive tasks: Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go and antisaccade are the right family for inhibition; Stroop/affective Stroop can support interference/affect regulation; WCST is too nonspecific and should be down‑weighted or omitted. All such tests have state noise and limited ecological validity; they need performance‑validity testing and, ideally, replication or cross‑test convergence.
- Stress/exposure markers: Historic blood lead levels (especially repeated ≥5 µg/dL in childhood or a single ≥10) are probative of developmental insult to prefrontal systems, but not moment‑to‑moment control. Hair/diurnal cortisol patterns support chronic stress physiology yet are nonspecific and sensitive to confounds. These belong in a corroboration role, not as centerpieces.

Minimum bundle I would require (clear and convincing), with no single element sufficient:

1) Event‑level signature of reactive dyscontrol
- Rapid escalation (seconds/minutes) following a salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring, staging, or concealment; contemporaneous indicators of autonomic arousal or dissociation (“saw red,” “went blank”), preferably corroborated by video/911/body‑cam or neutral witnesses.

2) Pre‑offense documentation of stimulus‑bound loss of control
- Nonforensic records predating the offense (school IEPs/discipline for explosive reactivity, juvenile/ED notes of dissociation or IED‑like episodes, sleep disruption tied to neighborhood conditions). This addresses temporality and mitigates reverse‑causation concerns.

3) Neurocognitive evidence of impaired inhibition with validity safeguards
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below age‑normed means on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT on Stop‑Signal, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop), with:
  - Multiple performance‑validity tests passed (embedded and stand‑alone).
  - Cross‑task or test–retest convergence.
  - Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive aggression (e.g., PCL‑R not in high range), used cautiously.

4) Clinical linkage that maps the mechanism to the index event
- Structured diagnosis by a qualified clinician (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype, Intermittent Explosive Disorder), anchored to documented exposures, with symptom triggers plausibly explaining the index event. Biological stress markers (e.g., flattened hair cortisol over prior 3 months) may corroborate but are not required.

5) Objective developmental exposure consistent with the mechanism
- At least one independently documented biological insult pre‑dating the offense (childhood lead exposure as above; documented iron‑deficiency anemia/malnutrition during sensitive periods; FASD risk with medical corroboration), plus geocoded deprivation history to show dose.

Mandatory disqualifiers/controls
- Voluntary intoxication as proximate driver defeats the excuse; if substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of acute effects.
- Strong evidence of instrumental planning or goal‑directed motive defeats the excuse.
- Exclude primary psychosis/mania unless the theory of excuse is different and independently satisfied.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple validity indices, collateral informants, consistency across sessions.
- Timing: testing as early as practicable, with heavy weight on pre‑charge records to avoid forensic artifact.

Scientific pitfalls to watch
- State–trait confounds: Sleep loss, acute legal stress, medication changes can depress test performance and blunt cortisol. Standardize testing conditions and, where possible, repeat or corroborate; consider actigraphy or verified sleep history.
- Malingering/secondary gain: “Too bad to be true” profiles, selective impairment, or failure patterns that collapse under embedded PVTs.
- Acute intoxication: Alcohol/stimulants degrade inhibition; keep the doctrine separate from voluntary intoxication rules.
- Reverse causation: Post‑offense incarceration stress can flatten cortisol and impair performance; rely on pre‑offense records and historic biomarkers.
- Over‑interpretation/“neuro‑mystique”: fMRI or exotic metrics carry high 403 risk; absent strong Daubert showings, admit only well‑validated behavioral and biological measures with known error rates and general acceptance for the specific inferential task.

Process safeguards and scope (to preserve administrability and legitimacy)
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing keyed to a standardized checklist covering the five pillars and disqualifiers; appoint neutral court experts in neuropsychology, psychiatry, and environmental health; ensure funding parity for indigent defendants.
- Confine applicability to reactive violent offenses (and, in rare cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts); presumptively exclude planned acquisitive crime.
- Clear‑and‑convincing burden that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act.
- Jury instruction clarifying that anger alone is insufficient; the question is whether, because of documented developmental insults and chronic stress, the defendant’s capacity to inhibit a reflexive aggressive response was substantially impaired at the time.

Relationship to other doctrines and disposition
- Where homicide is charged but the event lacks the tight “reactive” signature needed for excuse, channel to MPC §210.3 (extreme emotional disturbance) for partial mitigation.
- If the excuse is found, prefer ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions with supervision, targeted treatment, and removal from criminogenic contexts; reserve civil commitment for those who remain demonstrably dangerous after independent evaluation; include victim‑input and risk‑management conditions.

Bottom line: Professor Santiago’s Stage 2 elements are directionally right; the court should narrow the battery to tasks that validly assay inhibition, insist on pre‑offense documentation and event‑level corroboration, and treat physiological markers as corroborative only. With those guardrails, a clear‑and‑convincing standard tied to a prescribed bundle can keep this a rare, rule‑governed excuse and avoid both floodgates and expressive harm.

You began to flag pitfalls; can you complete your assessment by specifying, as a gatekeeping matter, (i) the minimum convergence bundle you’d require to infer substantial degradation of control at the moment (in plain terms a judge can charge a jury on), and (ii) the top red flags that should presumptively bar the excuse (e.g., reverse causation signals, intoxication patterns, malingering profiles)? Also, brief view on fMRI/EEG—admit only as supportive under Daubert, or exclude altogether?

### Speaker: Dr. Naomi Chen

Thank you. I broadly agree with Prof. Santiago’s two‑stage approach, with one caveat up front: none of these tools can “time‑stamp” loss of control at the precise moment of the offense. The science can justify a clear‑and‑convincing inference only when there is tight convergence between (a) long‑run exposures known to degrade inhibitory control, (b) pre‑offense evidence of dyscontrol, (c) current neurocognitive deficits with validity safeguards, and (d) an event signature of reactive (not instrumental) aggression.

On specificity and temporal sensitivity
- Neurocognitive tasks
  - Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go (SSRT) and antisaccade are the most mechanism‑proximal measures of motor/affective inhibition we have; they are state‑sensitive (sleep, meds, motivation) and must be interpreted with performance‑validity checks and, ideally, repeat/corroborative testing.
  - Affective interference tasks (emotional Go–No‑Go or affective Stroop) add ecological validity for anger‑triggered assaults; classic Stroop and WCST are supportive but relatively nonspecific (set‑shifting more than inhibition).
  - Include delay‑discounting or similar impulsive‑choice measures; downweight broad “frontal lobe” tests that are easily confounded by education/literacy.
- Stress/exposure markers
  - Hair cortisol (3 cm segment) reflects roughly three months of chronic load and is less noisy than single‑day salivary profiles, but is affected by hair treatments and ethnicity; treat as supportive.
  - Historic childhood blood lead levels (BLLs)—especially repeated ≥5 µg/dL or any ≥10 µg/dL in sensitive windows—are probative of developmental insult to prefrontal circuits; they do not speak to momentary state.
  - Iron‑deficiency/malnutrition and documented prenatal alcohol exposure are corroborative, not determinative.
  - HRV (low resting vagal tone) and heightened threat‑potentiated startle can support an affect‑regulation mechanism; again, supportive only.

Minimum converging bundle for clear‑and‑convincing (all five)
1) Event‑level reactive profile
   - Near‑immediate escalation after salient provocation; disorganized execution; no luring/staging/cover‑up; contemporaneous witness/bodycam/911 indicators of dissociation or autonomic arousal. Any planning or instrumental motive should presumptively defeat the excuse.

2) Pre‑offense dyscontrol record
   - Nonforensic, pre‑charge documentation (school IEP/discipline for explosive reactivity, pediatric/ED notes, juvenile mental‑health entries) evidencing stimulus‑bound loss of control; addresses temporality and reverse‑causation.

3) Neurocognitive deficits with validity
   - ≥1.5 SD impairment on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT, antisaccade, affective Go–No‑Go/Stroop), stable across sessions or convergent across tasks; intact effort indices (multiple embedded and stand‑alone PVTs). Low–moderate psychopathic traits to fit an impulsive, not predatory, profile.

4) Psychiatric linkage that maps to the offense
   - Structured‑interview diagnosis (e.g., PTSD—dissociative subtype; Intermittent Explosive Disorder) anchored to documented exposures; symptom content plausibly explains the index trigger and dissociation. Biological stress markers (hair cortisol) are supportive but not required.

5) Objective developmental insult
   - At least one independently documented biological insult (historic BLLs, early iron‑deficiency/malnutrition, well‑documented FASD risk) temporally preceding and plausibly contributing to the measured executive deficits.

Mandatory exclusions/controls
- Substantial voluntary intoxication as proximate cause defeats the excuse; baseline dyscontrol must be shown independent of acute substance effects.
- Rule out primary psychosis/mania unrelated to RSB, acute TBI at offense, or clear instrumental motives.
- Malingering safeguards: multiple PVTs, cross‑source consistency, and collateral informants; beware “too bad to be true” or selective profiles.
- Standardize state factors: document sleep (actigraphy if possible), medication/caffeine, and pain; repeat testing where feasible.
- Use demographically corrected norms; avoid misclassifying deficits due to language/education; ensure tests are appropriate for the defendant’s cultural/educational background.

Scientific pitfalls to flag for courts
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, or medication changes can depress performance and flatten cortisol; rely heavily on pre‑offense records and, when possible, hair cortisol to capture pre‑charge windows.
- Malingering/secondary gain: require multiple validity indicators and replication/triangulation.
- Acute intoxication: common and strongly inhibitory‑impairing; the law rightly treats voluntary use as non‑exculpatory.
- Reverse causation/forensic artifact: post‑charge stress can generate “findings”; prioritize records created before the legal case.
- Over‑interpretation of neurobiomarkers: fMRI/EEG lack individual‑diagnostic specificity; admit only as supportive, with clear limiting instructions. Candidate genes/polygenic scores should be excluded at this time—they lack validity for individual attribution and risk bias.
- Base‑rate and equity issues: adverse exposures are common in some communities; without tight event‑level criteria, the defense becomes over‑inclusive. Neutral experts and pre‑specified thresholds mitigate this.

Process safeguards
- Pretrial Daubert‑style hearing tied to the elements above; court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health).
- Standardized documentary templates (medical/CPS/school/housing/EPA‑HUD/UI records; geocoded exposure histories).
- Testing within 30–60 days when possible, with replication or corroboration; heavy weight on pre‑offense documentation.

Bottom line
These measures are not clocks; they cannot prove second‑by‑second volitional failure. But when an acute, provoked, disorganized assault is paired with pre‑offense dyscontrol, objective developmental insults, validated inhibitory deficits, and a diagnosis that maps to the trigger—and alternative causes are ruled out—it is scientifically defensible to infer substantial impairment of inhibitory control at the time of offense. That is the narrow window in which a dyscontrol excuse should operate, followed by ESB‑oriented, noncarceral dispositions under court supervision for those who remain safe to manage in the community, with civil commitment reserved for the truly dangerous.

### Speaker: Host

Dr. Chen just outlined a convergence test for reactive dyscontrol that relies on multi‑domain evidence and strict disqualifiers. From an administrability and error‑cost perspective, what concrete gatekeeping architecture would you put in place to manage this—e.g., the precise contents of a pretrial proffer, Daubert factors tailored to dyscontrol, use (and selection) of court‑appointed neutral experts, and whether to require special interrogatories to the jury on (a) substantial impairment and (b) causal contribution? Please be specific about the steps and thresholds you’d adopt to minimize false acquittals without converting the gate into a dead letter for indigent defendants.

### Speaker: Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.)

Hon. Marcus Ellery (Ret.):

I largely agree with Dr. Chen’s core point: none of the Stage 2 tools is, standing alone, specific or time‑precise enough to prove loss of control “at the moment.” The question for courts is whether a tight, pre‑specified bundle of converging findings, anchored to an event signature of reactive violence and to pre‑offense documentation, can carry a clear‑and‑convincing burden in a narrow slice of cases. With the right guardrails, yes.

1) What the tests can and cannot do
- Neurocognitive tasks (Stop‑Signal/Go–No‑Go, antisaccade, affective interference paradigms) index trait‑level inhibitory vulnerabilities with moderate reliability. They do not time‑stamp momentary control failure; they are supportive of mechanism.
- WCST is nonspecific; downweight it. If included, pair with tasks squarely on inhibition/affect regulation, and use multiple performance‑validity tests.
- Stress markers (hair/diurnal cortisol) and historic BLLs are, at best, chronic‑load and developmental‑insult indices. They bolster plausibility and temporality; they do not adjudicate the instant episode.

2) Minimum bundle I would require (all five; anything less should fail)
A. Event signature consistent with reactive dyscontrol
- Near‑immediate escalation after a salient provocation; no luring or staging; disorganized execution; contemporaneous descriptions of “blanking,” “seeing red,” pronounced autonomic arousal. Video/911/body‑cam or neutral witnesses, if available, are gold.

B. Pre‑offense documentation of dyscontrol
- Nonforensic records predating the offense showing stimulus‑bound loss of control (school IEP/discipline, juvenile/ED notes, prior documented rage episodes, sleep disruption). This addresses temporality and reduces litigation artifact.

C. Neurocognitive profile with validity
- Deficits ≥1.5 SD below age‑ and education‑adjusted norms on at least two inhibition/affect‑regulation tasks (e.g., SSRT on Stop‑Signal + affective Go–No‑Go/affective Stroop), with intact performance‑validity indices and either replication or cross‑test convergence.
- Trait profile consistent with impulsive/reactive, not predatory, aggression (use PCL‑R cautiously; consider complementary measures).

D. Psychiatric linkage that maps to the index event
- Structured‑diagnostic evidence of PTSD (dissociative subtype), Intermittent Explosive Disorder, or comparable condition; symptom triggers and phenomenology plausibly explain the episode; diagnosis tied to pre‑existing exposures (not created ex post).

E. Objective exposure biomarker consistent with mechanism
- At least one independently documented developmental insult (e.g., childhood BLL ≥5 µg/dL with repeated elevations or a single ≥10; FASD risk with medical corroboration; documented iron‑deficiency/malnutrition in sensitive periods). This should predate and plausibly contribute to current deficits.

And all of the following disqualifiers/controls:
- Voluntary intoxication: substantial acute alcohol/stimulant effects as the proximate driver defeat the excuse. If substances were present, the defense must show baseline dyscontrol independent of intoxication.
- Malingering/secondary gain: multiple embedded and stand‑alone validity tests; consistency across sessions; collateral informants. “Too bad to be true” profiles should not pass Daubert.
- Alternative explanations: rule out primary psychosis/mania (unless separately litigated), acute TBI at the scene, and clear instrumental motives (planning, concealment, gain).
- Timing: administer testing as soon as practicable and corroborate with pre‑offense records to avoid reverse‑causation from post‑charge stress.

3) Procedural guardrails (administrability and equality)
- Stage‑1 screen first; only then hold a Daubert‑style hearing on Stage‑2, with a structured proffer keyed to the elements above.
- Court‑appointed neutral experts (neuropsychology, psychiatry, environmental health); limit expert testimony to methods/findings and mapping to accepted constructs—no “ultimate issue” opinions on legal culpability.
- Standardized documentary templates (medical labs, CPS, school, housing, EPA/HUD, UI records; geocoded exposure history) and notice deadlines; symmetrical disclosure.
- Funding parity for indigent defendants; otherwise the doctrine will be illusory and unequal.

4) Scientific/legal pitfalls courts should police
- State–trait confounds: acute sleep loss, incarceration stress, medication effects can depress performance and flatten cortisol. Standardize testing conditions; consider repeat testing; lean on pre‑offense records.
- Litigation artifacts: be wary of diagnoses first appearing post‑charge without historical corroboration.
- Over‑weighting nonspecific measures: WCST, single‑day salivary cortisol, unvalidated fMRI should not drive outcomes.
- PCL‑R misuse and bias: avoid using it as a gatekeeper; treat as one data point, mindful of disparities.
- Mixed‑motive cases: if the record shows both reactive affect and meaningful planning/instrumental gain, the defense should ordinarily fail; MPC‑style extreme emotional disturbance may remain for homicide mitigation.

5) Domain and instruction (to preserve legitimacy)
- Confine the excuse to genuinely reactive interpersonal violence (and, in exceptional cases, truly impulsive nonviolent acts). Planned acquisitive crime is out.
- Burden: clear and convincing that (i) inhibitory control was substantially degraded and (ii) that degradation was a substantial contributing cause of the act, not due to voluntary intoxication.
- Model jury instruction: focus the jury on fair‑opportunity to comply at the time, using the actor‑in‑situation lens but requiring substantial impairment of self‑control, not mere anger or adversity.

Bottom line: Santiago’s Stage‑2 framework is directionally right if we tighten it to (a) event‑level reactivity, (b) pre‑offense documentation, (c) validated inhibition deficits with performance validity, (d) a diagnosis that fits the episode, and (e) at least one developmental biomarker—plus strong exclusions. Applied this way, the doctrine will remain narrow, governable, and consistent with Hart’s fairness limit and public legitimacy.
