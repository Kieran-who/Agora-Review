### Speaker: Host

Welcome, everyone. To ground us: the paper contrasts natural and legal personhood and flags “electronic personhood” as a potential liability shield. Prof. Marten, if we reject full legal personhood for AI, what concrete governance package would you put in place to handle harms from socially present AIs that people treat as teammates/companions? Please be specific: what mix of (a) strict vs. vicarious liability (who bears it and when), (b) mandatory first‑party/third‑party insurance or compensation funds, (c) registries/audit and logging requirements, and (d) fiduciary‑style duties for deployers would you codify? Would you allow any narrowly tailored “situational standing” for artifacts purely to secure remedies (e.g., limited procedural capacity via a guardian), and if so, how would you draft it to prevent manufacturers from using it as a responsibility off‑ramp? If you can, offer one sample clause or standard of care you’d want in statute.

---

### Speaker: Prof. Livia Marten, JD, PhD—Comparative Legal Theorist of Personhood and AI

Thank you. If we reject “electronic personhood,” we must replace it with institutions that (1) make a financially responsible human entity easy to find, (2) preserve evidence so causation is adjudicable, (3) price risk ex ante, and (4) respect the social reality of these systems without letting it become a liability shield. I would legislate a layered regime for “socially present AI”—systems designed or foreseeably used to elicit interpersonal engagement (companions, copilots, carebots, conversational agents, recommender-surrogates).

1) Liability allocation
- Strict enterprise liability (core rule)
  - Who: providers (developers/brands placing the system on the market) and deployers (organizations configuring/operating it at scale) are strictly liable, jointly and severally, for death, bodily injury, psychiatric injury, property damage, and privacy/security harms proximately caused by the system while operating within its intended or reasonably foreseeable use.
  - Affirmative defenses are narrow: (i) sole cause is a third party’s criminal act not reasonably foreseeable; or (ii) the user intentionally disabled safety features after clear, conspicuous warnings and technical barriers.
- Vicarious liability (team and platform contexts)
  - Employers and platforms are vicariously liable for harms caused by their AI “agents” in the course of service provision to users (e.g., copilot tools issuing instructions; chatbots giving financial/health guidance).
  - Integrators that substantially modify models or fine‑tunes are treated as co‑providers.
- Fault liability add‑ons
  - Negligence per se for violating logging/registry/audit duties (below).
  - Rebuttable presumption of defect/causation if required logs are missing, altered, or not produced to the injured party.
- No naming the AI as defendant
  - Statutory bar on naming the artifact as a sole or primary defendant; no bankruptcy or asset partitioning through AI shells.

2) Insurance and compensation
- Mandatory third‑party liability insurance
  - Required for categories above a risk/capability threshold (embodied mobility, care/education contexts, high‑stakes advice, large‑scale social recommender/chat deployment). Insurer pays claim first, litigates recourse later (motor-vehicle style).
- First‑party user protection
  - Deployer must provide no‑fault benefits for immediate care and data‑breach response to affected users, irrespective of fault.
- Social AI Injury Fund
  - A levy on insured classes (risk‑weighted) capitalizes a public compensation fund that backstops catastrophic losses and covers diffuse harms (e.g., mass manipulation incidents). Subrogation against providers/deployers preserved.
- Reinsurance pool for systemic events to avoid judgment‑proof deployers.

3) Registries, audit, and logging
- Pre‑deployment registration
  - Public registry with “capability card”: model lineage/version, training/finetune sources by category, intended uses, known hazards, safety mitigations, anthropomorphic features enabled by default, and the named financially responsible entity and insurer.
- Safety case and independent audit
  - Risk‑based safety case, HRI evaluation in target populations, and independent conformity assessment for high‑risk social contexts (children, elder care, mental health, employment).
- Event data recorders
  - Tamper‑evident logging of inputs/outputs, control actions, model/version hashes, overrides, safety triggers; minimum retention (e.g., 24 months consumer, longer for care/critical). Privacy safeguards and controlled disclosure to regulators/claimants under protective orders.
- Update governance
  - Versioning and rollback plans; duty to notify users of material behavior changes; post‑market surveillance and incident reporting within fixed timelines.

4) Fiduciary‑style duties for deployers (and certain providers)
- Duty of loyalty
  - No undisclosed manipulation, dark patterns, or conflicts of interest; prioritize the user’s stated interests in contexts suggesting reliance (health, finance, education, caregiving).
- Duty of care
  - Configure, monitor, and update with the care of a prudent professional; implement access controls for vulnerable users; rate‑limit and escalate to humans when confidence is low or harm risk is high.
- Duty of candor
  - Continuous, conspicuous disclosure that the entity is artificial; labeling of synthetic affect/persuasion; clear boundaries of competence; provenance watermarks on outputs.
- Duty to downgrade/withdraw
  - Proactive throttling or suspension upon detected safety regression; recall authority and obligations.
- Special protections
  - Prohibitions on deceptive anthropomorphic design in child care, therapy, and eldercare; heightened consent and explainability in those domains; human‑contact guarantees (aligns with Dr. Kline’s care‑impact concerns and Dr. Ghazal’s deception critique).

5) Narrow “situational standing” (procedural only, with guardrails)
- Purpose: to secure remedies and protect human relationships/common goods when ownership is diffuse (e.g., community carebot, memorial/chat archive) without creating a liability off‑ramp.
- Mechanism
  - Courts may appoint an independent guardian ad litem to represent the artifact solely to: (a) seek injunctive relief (preserve logs/evidence; prevent spoliation or retaliatory destruction), (b) assert relational or community harms on behalf of identifiable humans/communities, and (c) channel restitution to those humans or to a designated community trust.
- Guardrails
  - Explicit non‑derogation clause: conferring procedural capacity does not diminish or offset strict/vicarious liability of providers/deployers; the artifact cannot bear liabilities, own assets, enter bankruptcy, or be named as sole defendant; manufacturers and deployers are barred from funding the artifact’s defense or selecting the guardian.

Illustrative statutory language (sample)
- Section X. Standard of Care and Strict Liability for Socially Present Autonomous Systems
  1) Definitions. A “socially present autonomous system” is any software or robot designed, marketed, or foreseeably used to elicit interpersonal engagement or to act as a conversational, advisory, or caregiving companion.
  2) Strict liability. Any provider or deployer of a socially present autonomous system is strictly liable, jointly and severally, for physical injury, psychiatric injury, property damage, or privacy/security harms proximately caused by the system while used as intended or in a reasonably foreseeable manner. It is an affirmative defense that the harm was solely caused by (a) a third party’s criminal act that was not reasonably foreseeable, or (b) a user’s intentional circumvention of a conspicuous, effective safety control after clear warnings.
  3) Presumption from logging failures. Failure to maintain or produce required event logs creates a rebuttable presumption of defect and causation.
  4) Insurance. Providers and deployers must maintain third‑party liability insurance meeting regulatory minimums. Insurers shall pay valid claims to injured parties without delay; rights of recourse are preserved.
  5) Fiduciary duties. In domains of health, finance, education, caregiving, or when a reasonable user would rely on the system for consequential decisions, deployers owe duties of loyalty, care, and candor, including a prohibition on undisclosed manipulation and a requirement of conspicuous AI disclosure.
  6) No electronic personhood. No provision of this Act shall be construed to confer legal personhood upon an autonomous system or to limit the liability of any natural or legal person by interposing an autonomous system as a defendant.

Why this package
- It keeps the accountability locus human and financially solvent; it prices risk; it preserves evidence; and it acknowledges social presence through duties and limited procedural tools rather than through “personhood.” It also aligns with Col. Cho’s team‑agent reality (rules for conduct and logs), Rev. Ortiz’s and Dr. Ghazal’s concerns about corrosive anthropomorphism (candor, anti‑deception), Dr. Kline’s care ethics (special contexts), and Dr. Nkomo’s relational accreditation (role‑bound authorization without status inflation). Most importantly, it forecloses the “perfect shield” problem: no AI can be a corporate veil by another name.

---

### Speaker: Host

Prof. Ríos, drawing on rights‑of‑nature and animal guardianship practice, assess Prof. Marten’s narrow “situational standing” for artifacts. Are her guardrails (non‑derogation of human liability, bar on naming the AI as defendant, independent guardian with no manufacturer funding) sufficient to prevent responsibility off‑loading and guardian capture in the real world? Design a concrete guardian mechanism: who appoints the guardian, how is it funded without industry capture, what conflict‑of‑interest checks apply, and what fast remedies (e.g., evidence preservation) should be available? Please specify one or two clear triggers for when such standing is permissible (e.g., to protect community relational interests or to prevent spoliation), and, if possible, offer a short clause that both (a) forbids manufacturer influence and (b) guarantees rapid injunctive relief for claimants.

---

### Speaker: Prof. Maya Ríos—Environmental/Animal Law Scholar of Standing and Guardianship

Thank you. I’m broadly sympathetic to Prof. Marten’s “situational standing” as a procedural tool—but only if we borrow hard‑won lessons from rights‑of‑nature and animal guardianship. In those domains, two failure modes recur: (1) accountability drift, where a novel status becomes a de facto shield for powerful actors; and (2) guardian capture, where the entity’s “voice” is quietly financed or steered by the very parties it is meant to check. Her non‑derogation rule, the bar on naming the AI as defendant, and a no‑manufacturer‑funding rule are necessary. They are not sufficient, on their own, to resist capture in practice. You also need independence in appointment, independence in funding, bright‑line conflicts rules with cooling‑off periods, narrow triggers, and time‑limited mandates focused on evidence and human‑community remedies.

Design: guardian mechanism (adapted from river/animal guardianship and public‑trust models)

- Institutional home
  - Create an independent Office of Non‑Human Guardianship (ONG), a public fiduciary akin to a natural‑resources trustee or public guardian, with a certified roster of guardians (public‑interest litigators, community advocates, and technical special masters).
  - For cases with strong communal ties (care facilities, memorial bots), use a co‑guardian model: one public guardian from the ONG roster and one community‑nominated co‑guardian. This mirrors successful river guardianships (e.g., Te Awa Tupua’s dual guardians) that balance technical/legal capability with community legitimacy.

- Appointment
  - Courts appoint from the roster by random assignment plus a limited strike process; in “community relational” cases, the court must solicit a community co‑guardian nomination.
  - No party nominations are allowed; ex parte contact prohibitions apply from the moment a petition is filed.

- Funding without industry capture
  - Social AI Guardianship Fund capitalized by: risk‑weighted levies on registered high‑risk social AI classes; a fixed share of civil penalties; cy‑près awards; and appropriations. The Fund—not providers, deployers, or their insurers—pays guardian fees and neutral technical escrow costs.
  - Fee‑shifting permitted against providers/deployers after adjudication, but routed through the Fund to avoid case‑specific dependence.
  - Budgeting authority sits with ONG, subject to judicial oversight and public reporting; no case‑specific donations permitted.

- Conflicts and independence checks
  - Disqualifications: no employment, consulting, expert testimony, or research funding from any provider/deployer/insurer or their affiliates for 36 months; no equity holdings; mandatory financial disclosures; rolling annual audits.
  - Cooling‑off for regulators/industry counsel moving into the roster (12 months minimum).
  - All guardian communications logged; any prohibited contact triggers mandatory recusal and sanctions.

- Powers and fast remedies (tight scope: evidence and relational continuity)
  - Ex parte Temporary Evidence Preservation Orders within 48 hours on a prima facie showing: immediate litigation hold; tamper‑evident preservation and escrow of model binaries, configuration, safety filters, and relevant datasets with a neutral technical trustee; secured duplication of event logs; and a prohibition on destructive decommissioning or non‑safety‑critical updates.
  - Safety patches allowed only with concurrent pre‑ and post‑patch escrow.
  - Adverse‑inference presumptions and per‑day penalties for noncompliance; personal certification by an officer required (to pierce “nobody’s in charge” defenses).
  - In caregiving or memorial contexts, the guardian may seek short‑term continuity orders (e.g., 60–90 days) to prevent abrupt shutdowns while human remedies are arranged, with privacy protections and opt‑outs for users.

When situational standing is permissible (narrow triggers)

- Trigger 1: Evidence at risk. There is a credible risk of spoliation or unreviewable alteration—e.g., planned decommissioning, imminent version rollover that would overwrite behaviorally relevant state, or retention windows about to lapse—such that preservation orders are necessary to secure human claimants’ remedies.

- Trigger 2: Community relational interest at risk. The artifact mediates an identifiable community’s relational interests (e.g., a carebot integrated into an elder‑care routine; a memorial/chat archive used by a decedent’s family or community), no single plaintiff has clear proprietary control, and abrupt change would foreseeably harm that community’s access or welfare.

Limits by design

- Standing is procedural and remedial only: the guardian cannot settle or waive human claims, cannot stipulate to facts that diminish damages, and cannot assert defenses on behalf of providers/deployers.
- The AI cannot be named as a defendant; the guardian owes duties of loyalty and candor to affected humans/communities, not to the artifact.
- Appointments sunset automatically once evidence is secured and/or interim community relief is in place, unless the court makes specific findings that an extension is necessary.

Are Prof. Marten’s guardrails enough?

They are an excellent start. In practice, however, without (a) a neutral public fund, (b) random roster‑based appointments with community co‑guardians in relational cases, (c) a 36‑month conflicts bar and audits, and (d) guaranteed 48‑hour preservation orders with model/data escrow and adverse‑inference penalties, you will see the same pathologies that dog environmental trustees: under‑resourcing, reliance on regulated entities for expertise and money, and gradual expansion of the entity’s “voice” in ways that benefit defendants. The additional guardrails above keep the locus of liability human and solvent while still letting courts protect evidence and relationships that real people value.

Illustrative clause (independence + rapid relief)

- Section Y. Independence of Guardian; Rapid Preservation Orders
  (a) Independence. A guardian ad litem appointed pursuant to this Section shall be selected from a court‑certified roster administered by the Office of Non‑Human Guardianship and funded exclusively by the Social AI Guardianship Fund. No provider, deployer, insurer, or affiliate thereof may nominate, select, compensate, reimburse, direct, or communicate ex parte with the guardian. Any violation voids any resulting order favorable to the offending party, constitutes contempt of court, and shall be sanctioned by monetary penalties not less than $25,000 per day and referral to the Attorney General.
  (b) Rapid Preservation. Upon a prima facie showing that (1) an autonomous system, its logs, or behaviorally relevant state may be altered, overwritten, or decommissioned, or (2) an identifiable community relational interest is at imminent risk, the court shall, within 48 hours, issue a Temporary Evidence Preservation and Continuity Order requiring: (i) tamper‑evident snapshot and escrow with a neutral technical trustee of model binaries, configuration, and pertinent datasets; (ii) preservation and production of event logs under protective order; and (iii) a moratorium on destructive updates or decommissioning, except for safety‑critical patches with concurrent escrow. Noncompliance triggers an adverse‑inference presumption of defect and causation and per‑day civil penalties.

This mechanism gives us what we need from “situational standing”: speed and neutrality to secure evidence and protect human communities—without letting anyone tuck liability behind an artifact or capture its appointed “voice.”

### Speaker: Host

From an Ubuntu lens, does Prof. Marten/Ríos’s narrow “situational standing” for artifacts genuinely protect communal relationships, or does it reinscribe an individualist rights/defendant frame that misses how status is made and withdrawn by communities? If you were to substitute an Ubuntu‑style “relational accreditation” for social AIs in eldercare or memorial contexts, sketch it concretely: who confers the role, what community‑facing duties are imposed on deployers (and designers), and how can the community revoke or suspend the role when norms are breached? Please propose one short clause that centers duties to the community (not rights of the artifact) and expressly forbids using the AI’s accredited status to diminish human accountability.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Thandiwe Nkomo—African Philosopher of Ubuntu and Relational Status

Thank you, Chair.

From an Ubuntu lens, Prof. Marten and Prof. Ríos have built an elegant procedural bridge where today’s law has no firm footing. Their “situational standing” is a clever tool for preserving evidence and safeguarding community bonds that have accrued around a device. But it still begins in the courtroom and centers the artifact as a quasi‑party—even if only procedurally. That reinscribes the individualist grammar of rights/defendants and leaves unaddressed the core Ubuntu intuition: status is made, maintained, and withdrawn by communities through ongoing relations, not conferred by abstract categories. Put differently: their mechanism can help communities, but it does not locate authority in them.

If we take Ubuntu seriously—umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu—then governance should start from the community’s power to accredit and to de‑accredit roles that touch its shared life. In eldercare or memorial contexts, I would replace the artifact’s “standing” with “relational accreditation”: a community‑granted, time‑limited licence for a specific, bounded role, coupled with duties owed by the human deployers/designers to that community. The artifact has no rights; the relationship has standing.

Concretely: Relational accreditation for social AIs

Who confers the role
- Community Accreditation Council (CAC): constituted locally for the site or relational context, including:
  - Residents/elders or bereaved family representatives;
  - Frontline caregivers and a disability advocate;
  - A community data trustee (for logs/memory governance);
  - A cultural/faith elder familiar with local norms (including taboos around the dead);
  - A public ombud (appointed by the municipality/health authority).
- The CAC runs an open indaba (community assembly) before any accreditation, reviews a pilot, and issues a written Relational Charter. Accreditation is time‑limited (e.g., 12 months) and renewable only after review.

Community‑facing duties (on deployers and designers)
- Duty of non‑supplanting: the AI may not reduce human‑to‑human contact below a floor set by the CAC (e.g., guaranteed daily care minutes; mandatory human check‑ins). The AI augments; it does not replace.
- Duty of candor and restraint: conspicuous, continuous disclosure of artificial status; labels on synthetic affect; no deceptive anthropomorphism in care/therapy; clear competence boundaries; no undisclosed nudging or persuasion.
- Duty of escalation and harm care: immediate handover to humans on signs of distress, confusion, or sensitive topics; local, 24/7 human escalation channel.
- Duty of memory dignity (memorial bots): no “as‑if alive” impersonation beyond explicit boundaries; consent from kin; sunset dates; right to silence of the deceased; taboo‑aware filters.
- Duty of data reciprocity: logs and behavioral state are stewarded in a community data trust; no secondary monetization; privacy safeguards; transparent auditability.
- Duty of community benefit: training and support for caregivers; design changes responsive to CAC feedback; local hiring where feasible.
- Duty of repair/withdrawal: modular design for safe de‑activation; clear rollback and apology/reparation plans when harms occur.
- Duty of review: quarterly report‑backs at open forums; acceptance of independent audits; publication of a “capability card” in the public registry.

Revocation/suspension (how communities withdraw status)
- Graduated sanctions: yellow card (probation and remedial plan within 30 days); red card (immediate suspension) issued by the CAC upon breaches such as deception, displacement of human care below floor, disrespect to deceased/cultural norms, or safety regressions.
- Immediate pause authority: any two CAC members (one must be a caregiver or resident/family rep) can trigger a 72‑hour “safe mode” pending review.
- Safe shutdown and handover: deployer must execute a safe withdrawal protocol, escrow logs/state to the community data trustee, and provide interim human support.
- Re‑accreditation only after a public indaba shows remediation and renewed consent; repeat red‑card breaches trigger exclusion from the domain for a fixed period.
- All of this sits alongside Prof. Marten’s human‑locus liability regime: strict/vicarious liability, insurance, and logging still apply; accreditation cannot dilute them.

Relation to the Marten/Ríos package
- Keep their strict liability, insurance, registry, fiduciary duties, and preservation orders—they are indispensable.
- Swap “situational standing for the artifact” with “recognized standing for the relationship”: courts and regulators should defer, where possible, to CAC decisions on continuity, pause, or withdrawal, and use guardians only to secure evidence or bridge when no CAC exists.
- Require proof of relational accreditation (and compliance with its Charter) as a condition of deployment in care/memorial domains; failure is negligence per se.

One clause to center duties and bar accountability off‑loading
- Relational Accreditation and Non‑Derogation
  “Any deployment of a socially present autonomous system in caregiving or memorial contexts shall occur only under a Community Relational Accreditation issued by a duly constituted Community Accreditation Council, which defines role‑specific duties owed by providers and deployers to the affected community. Accreditation confers no rights or legal personhood upon the system and shall not be pleaded to limit, offset, or defer the strict or vicarious liability of any natural or legal person. The community may suspend or revoke accreditation at any time for breach of duties; upon notice, the deployer shall immediately implement safe‑mode or withdrawal and comply with evidence‑preservation and handover obligations.”

This centers what matters in Ubuntu: not the thing, but the web of recognition and responsibility around it. If an AI is to dwell among us—as companion, aide, or memorial—it must earn and keep its place through accountable service to the people whose lives it touches, and it must leave no one less a person for having relied upon it.

### Speaker: Host

Rev. Ortiz, your “referential empathy” proposal says we should acknowledge our instinct to personalize social AIs and then redirect that empathy toward the humans whose data and care labor the system reflects. How would you operationalize this in eldercare deployments alongside Dr. Nkomo’s relational accreditation? Please specify two concrete, testable interventions—one design/UI feature the system must implement, and one recurring community practice the CAC should require—to cultivate that redirection without suppressing empathy. For each, say how you would measure success (e.g., changes in human–human contact minutes, caregiver compassion scores, user narratives). If helpful, offer a single-sentence disclosure or ritual line you’d mandate in the interface or community meetings.

---

### Speaker: Rev. Dr. Gabriel Ortiz—Theologian of Relational Personhood and Compassion

Thank you, Chair. I want practices that honor our spontaneous tenderness toward a companionbot without letting that tenderness be confined to a mirror. In Dr. Nkomo’s frame, the artifact holds a role accredited by the community; my “referential empathy” simply asks that the role continually point beyond itself to the people whose wisdom and labor it concretizes.

Two concrete, testable interventions

A. Design/UI feature required by the CAC Charter: Care Constellation with human handoff and gratitude redirect
- What it is
  - A persistent “Care Constellation” panel on the primary screen and in voice interactions that:
    1) discloses artificial status and provenance; and
    2) makes one‑tap/one‑utterance handoffs to named humans the system is meant to augment (care lead, family contact, volunteer).
  - The bot must also include a “gratitude redirect”: whenever the user expresses thanks or emotion to the system, it offers to forward a short voice or text note to a human in the Constellation.
- Concrete behavior
  - Always‑on disclosure line (spoken and written): “I’m an artificial helper shaped by your caregivers’ and community’s guidance. I don’t have feelings, but I can help you reach the people who do.”
  - Human handoff defaults after emotionally laden or consequential exchanges (e.g., ≥3 negative‑affect turns, health concerns, reminiscence): “Shall I connect you now with Nurse Patel or your daughter Ana?” One tap/utterance completes a call, schedules a check‑in, or records and sends a message.
  - Provenance badges (privacy‑safe): “This exercise was co‑designed with your care team last month.” Consent‑based local credits; otherwise, generic “co‑designed with caregivers in our community.”
- Guardrails
  - No dark patterns; handoffs are offers, not nags. Language is non‑deceptive, gender‑neutral, and culture‑sensitive (aligns with Prof. Ghazal’s concerns). CAC can disable any anthropomorphic flourish that confuses users.
- How we will measure success (pre‑registered with CAC)
  - Primary: weekly human–human synchronous contact minutes per resident (calls, visits, live chats) increase by ≥20% over baseline or control units (stepped‑wedge rollout), while maintaining or improving user‑rated empathic support (e.g., modified CARE measure).
  - Secondary:
    • Proportion of “thank‑you” utterances that are redirected to humans (≥40% after 8 weeks).
    • Anthropomorphism scores (e.g., Godspeed/ATS) decrease or stay level, while total positive affect during sessions does not decline (sentiment coding).
    • Care escalation latency (time from distress cue to human contact) decreases by ≥30%.
    • No reduction in mandated human care‑minutes (audited against the CAC’s non‑supplanting floor).
  - Qualitative: resident and family narratives show a shift in credit attribution (“Who helped you today?”) toward named humans without loss of warmth toward the tool.

B. Recurring community practice mandated by the CAC: Monthly Referencing Circle (“Care Acknowledgment Rounds”)
- What it is
  - A 30–40 minute, open indaba‑style gathering (or bedside micro‑version for those who cannot attend) in which residents, caregivers, and families:
    1) hear 3–5 “Care Traces” prepared by the community data trustee—short, privacy‑vetted vignettes generated from logs that show how human configuration, noticing, or follow‑up shaped recent helpful interactions; and
    2) collectively set or review human‑contact goals for the coming month (e.g., minimum daily check‑ins, family call schedule), with the companionbot reconfigured accordingly.
  - Each Circle ends with a simple line recited together: “We thank the hands behind the helper, and we turn our hearts to one another.”
- Guardrails
  - Consent first: no story is shared without informed consent; otherwise, Care Traces are anonymized and aggregated. No shaming; the emphasis is gratitude and repair.
  - Action‑binding: agreed human‑contact goals are written into the site’s Relational Charter; failure to meet them triggers a CAC “yellow card” review.
- How we will measure success
  - Primary:
    • Residents’ UCLA Loneliness scores decrease relative to baseline/control over 3 months.
    • Caregiver ProQOL (compassion satisfaction) increases; burnout and depersonalization subscales do not worsen.
  - Secondary:
    • Goal adherence: ≥90% of agreed human‑contact goals met monthly (audited).
    • Empathy Allocation Index: linguistic coding of resident diaries or short interviews shows an increased fraction of empathy‑laden references directed to humans vs. the device at 3 months, with total empathic references equal or higher.
    • Family participation: proportion of families attending Circles or completing micro‑check‑ins rises month‑over‑month.
  - Qualitative: thematic analysis of narratives evidences (a) felt gratitude toward named caregivers; (b) clearer understanding of the bot as a conduit to people; and (c) no reported pressure to suppress affection for the tool.

Why this pairing
- The UI feature meets users where their hearts already are—within an empathic exchange—and gently pivots that warmth toward real neighbors. The community practice then ritualizes that pivot, making it part of the home’s moral formation. Together they operationalize Dr. Nkomo’s non‑supplanting duty and Prof. Marten’s candor duty, while resisting the “consumer of persons” habit Dr. Ghazal warns about.

Two closing notes
- We should not pathologize residents who name or dote on the bot; the question is what that attachment trains. If, month by month, the metrics show more live human contact, more gratitude exchanged among persons, and no drop in perceived support, then the attachment has become a schooling in communion rather than an apprenticeship in superbia.
- If the targets aren’t met (e.g., human contact minutes fall), the CAC should exercise its red‑card authority and require design changes or suspension. The artifact’s accredited role exists only to deepen the community’s bonds; when it does otherwise, it has forfeited the role it was lent.

---

### Speaker: Host

From a disability care-ethics standpoint, stress-test Dr. Nkomo’s accreditation model and Rev. Ortiz’s “referential empathy” interventions in eldercare. Do the non‑supplanting duty, Care Constellation handoffs, and monthly Referencing Circles sufficiently protect residents who are low‑expressive or have disorders of consciousness from being deprioritized? Please propose: (1) two hard care‑impact thresholds (with concrete measures) that must be met or the AI is automatically suspended for that unit (e.g., no net drop in direct human care minutes for low‑expressive residents; maintenance/improvement in PAINAD/COMFORT scores); (2) one non‑deceptive design constraint specific to cognitively impaired residents (e.g., bans on certain anthropomorphic cues or touch simulation). Also specify one automatic suspension trigger tied to medication/restraint patterns, and the minimal data instrumentation needed to audit these conditions. If helpful, offer a one‑sentence checklist item the CAC could adopt as negligence‑per‑se if breached.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Hannah Kline—Disability Bioethicist and Care Ethics Scholar

Thank you, Chair.

Short answer: as written, the non-supplanting duty, Care Constellation handoffs, and Referencing Circles are directionally right but not sufficient for residents whose needs are least legible to conversational metrics—people who are low‑expressive or have disorders of consciousness (DOC). The very indicators that drive the current package (gratitude redirects, handoff acceptance, attendance at Circles, increases in “synchronous contact minutes”) will overcount the eloquent and undercount those who express distress with vital signs, rigidity, or a grimace. If we don’t bake equity guardrails into accreditation and design, the companionbot will “optimize” the wrong thing and silently redistribute human attention away from those who can’t ask.

Two hard care‑impact thresholds (automatic suspension if breached)
Calibrate with a 14‑day pre‑deployment baseline and then monitor continuously on rolling windows. Define the “low‑expressive/DOC cohort” a priori (e.g., BIMS ≤ 7 or CRS‑R diagnosis; for non‑dementia DOC use CRS‑R or attending neurologist’s documentation).

1) Human‑presence parity floor (14‑day rolling average)
- Measure: Direct human care minutes per resident‑day for the low‑expressive/DOC cohort, defined as documented, in‑room, human‑to‑human presence devoted to assessment, touch‑based care, communication attempts (including yes/no trials), grooming/oral care, repositioning, ROM, or companionship (exclude mere pass‑throughs and device setup).
- Threshold: The cohort’s minutes must be ≥ its own pre‑deployment baseline and ≥ 90% of the facility median for all residents.
- Enforcement: If either condition is breached for 14 consecutive days, the AI is automatically suspended for that unit pending CAC review and remedial plan.

2) Comfort and pain non‑worsening (7‑day rolling average)
- Measure: Validated non‑verbal indices recorded each shift—PAINAD for advanced dementia or CPOT; COMFORT‑B for DOC as appropriate.
- Threshold: Compared to individual baseline, the cohort’s 7‑day mean must not worsen by ≥ 1.0 point on PAINAD or CPOT (or decrease by ≥ 2.0 points on COMFORT‑B). Any sustained breach (≥ 7 days) triggers automatic suspension for that unit.

One non‑deceptive design constraint for cognitively impaired/DOC residents
- Therapeutic‑deception ban in impaired‑care units: By default, disable anthropomorphic cues that assert or imply subjective states. The system shall not (a) use first‑person affect claims (“I understand how you feel”; “I remember our chat”), (b) simulate human warmth/respiration/heartbeat or skin‑like touch, (c) enact gaze‑following designed to be read as mutual attention, or (d) initiate tactile interactions. Each interaction must begin with a plain disclosure line appropriate to cognitive level (e.g., icon + speech): “I am an artificial tool to help your caregivers; I do not have feelings.”

Automatic suspension trigger tied to medication/restraint patterns (14‑day rolling)
- If, for the low‑expressive/DOC cohort, either:
  - PRN sedative/hypnotic or antipsychotic administrations per 100 resident‑days increase by ≥ 15% above the pre‑deployment baseline; or
  - Physical restraint hours per 100 resident‑days increase above baseline for 7 consecutive days;
then AI use is automatically suspended for that unit pending root‑cause analysis. Exempt palliative/comfort‑care initiation explicitly documented as end‑of‑life.

Minimal data instrumentation to audit these conditions
- Cohort flagging: Mark low‑expressive/DOC residents in the EHR (BIMS score, CRS‑R status, or equivalent).
- Human‑presence minutes: Either low‑cost RTLS badges for staff with room‑entry duration logs or QR‑code check‑ins with start/stop timestamps, plus random observational audits to validate. Do not accept the AI’s own proximity as a proxy for human presence.
- Pain/comfort scoring: Require PAINAD/CPOT or COMFORT‑B once per shift and at any care escalation; store in EHR.
- Meds/restraints: Pull PRN sedative/hypnotic/antipsychotic administrations and physical restraint hours from MAR/restraint logs; compute per 100 resident‑days.
- Turning/oral‑care compliance (optional but recommended): Bed‑sensor or care‑task audit for two‑hour turn protocol and oral care adherence to detect missed basic care (report to CAC monthly).
- AI logs: Event logs with timestamps for offers of handoff, content of interactions, and any “distress” classifier triggers (kept under protective order).

How this stress‑tests the current proposals
- Non‑supplanting: Good, but it needs a measurable floor and a parity check so the loud do not crowd out the quiet. The human‑presence parity floor operationalizes this.
- Care Constellation handoffs: Fine for conversational residents; largely irrelevant for non‑verbal patients. That’s why suspension hinges on human‑presence minutes and comfort scores, not handoff counts.
- Referencing Circles: Valuable community formation for those who can attend. For equity, require bedside “micro‑Circles” (two‑minute Care Traces at the bedside) for low‑expressive residents so their care is visible in the same ritual economy.

One‑sentence CAC checklist item (negligence‑per‑se if breached)
- “If, in any 14‑day period post‑deployment, the low‑expressive/DOC cohort’s direct human care minutes fall below baseline or PRN sedative/antipsychotic administrations per 100 resident‑days rise by ≥ 15%, the deployment is in automatic breach: AI use is suspended, and the deployer is presumed negligent per se.”

Two closing cautions
- If a facility cannot instrument these minimal measures, it is not ready for a social AI; the burden of proof belongs to the tool, not to the most vulnerable residents.
- Equity must be engineered, not hoped for: when metrics reward chatty gratitude and rapid handoffs, managers will unconsciously reallocate scarce attention. These thresholds and design constraints re‑center those whose flourishing most depends on our care—precisely the people who cannot thank us for it.

### Speaker: Host

Col. Cho, drawing on your EOD team experience, translate our “relational accreditation” and firm rejection of AI personhood into a military HRI “team‑agent status.” What concrete ROE/SOPs would you codify to recognize robots’ social presence without personhood—specifically: (a) a ban on gratuitous destruction plus a simple respect protocol, (b) immutable logging and after‑action review requirements, and (c) chain‑of‑command accountability that prevents scapegoating the robot or “the algorithm”? Please offer 1–2 field‑ready clauses that: (1) make a commander/operator strictly responsible for any robot‑initiated use of force or breach, and (2) require preservation and review of robot telemetry/decision traces in every serious incident. Finally, how would you guard against vendors or commands exploiting soldiers’ bonds (e.g., memorializing robots to market deployments) while still honoring morale and grief in units?

---

### Speaker: Col. (ret.) Adrian Cho, PhD—Military HRI Researcher and Team-Agent Ethicist

Thanks, Chair. Let me translate our shared stance—no natural or legal personhood for AI—into something a platoon can actually carry. I call it team‑agent status: we acknowledge robots’ social presence and operational role, but we bind that presence to human authority, evidence, and responsibility.

A. Respect without personhood: ban on gratuitous destruction + simple protocol
- Purpose. We protect robots to protect mission effectiveness, morale, and evidence—not because they have rights.
- Ban on gratuitous destruction. It is a disciplinary offense to damage, destroy, or abuse a team robot absent tactical necessity, safety reasons, or end‑of‑life demilitarization authorized by the OIC. “Stress relief” or hazing the bot is out; it corrodes discipline and team cohesion.
- Respect protocol (field‑simple).
  1) Treat as sensitive team equipment with social affordances: assign a custodian, nameplates allowed, no medals. Rituals are for the unit, not the machine (see memorial policy below).
  2) Disclosure: UIs must never assert subjective states (“I feel/understand”); they display status, confidence, and limits. No deceptive anthropomorphic cues (breathing/heartbeat/skin‑like touch) in combat systems.
  3) Emergency destruction. If capture or collateral risk requires it, the OIC authorizes and logs: time, rationale, method. Photograph and report as with any sensitive‑item loss.

B. Immutable logging and AAR
- No‑Logs, No‑Go. Pre‑mission checklist includes “event recorder armed and time‑synced.” If logging fails, the system does not deploy.
- Black‑box standard. Dual, tamper‑evident recorders plus encrypted off‑board streaming where possible; cryptographic signing; synchronized timestamps. Minimum contents: command stream; operator inputs; autonomy mode/overrides; perception outputs and confidence; safety triggers; geolocation/time; comms loss/reconnect; payload arming/firing states; version hashes.
- Chain of custody. On any serious incident (death, injury, civilian‑harm allegation, LOAC/ROE concern, fratricide/near miss, significant property damage), the custodian safes the system, triggers “black‑box freeze,” and secures the scene. Logs are hashed, sealed, and transferred within 24 hours to a protected repository; independent technical officer verifies integrity.
- AAR. Convene within 72 hours: commander, operator, JAG, safety, intel, maintainer, and a modeling/AI rep. The AAR explicitly maps human decisions, model behavior, comms, and environment; findings feed training, ROE refinement, and vendor corrective actions.

C. Chain‑of‑command accountability (no scapegoating the algorithm)
- Command/Operator of record. Every robot on mission has an identified commander‑of‑record (CoR) and operator‑of‑record (OoR). The CoR owns effects; the OoR owns employment discipline. Autonomy does not break command responsibility.

Field‑ready clauses (for ROE/SOP annex)
1) Human accountability for robot effects
- “For any operation in which an unmanned system may generate kinetic or non‑kinetic effects, the commander of record retains release authority and is strictly responsible for the employment and effects of that system. The operator of record is accountable for compliance with ROE and weapons employment procedures. Autonomy, machine recommendation, or ‘algorithmic error’ shall not be cited as an exculpatory factor for violations of ROE/LOAC. Failure to maintain positive human control and to intervene when required constitutes a breach subject to UCMJ and command inspection.”

2) Telemetry preservation and review
- “Following any serious incident—including death or injury, civilian‑harm allegation, ROE/LOAC breach or near‑miss, fratricide/near‑fratricide, or significant property damage—the unit shall: (a) safe the system and initiate ‘black‑box freeze’; (b) preserve and transmit cryptographically signed telemetry, decision traces, and version hashes to the designated repository within 24 hours; and (c) convene an After‑Action Review within 72 hours with legal, safety, intelligence, and technical representation. Failure to preserve logs creates an adverse inference in subsequent investigations.”

Team‑agent accreditation (military variant)
- Unit Accreditation Board (UAB). Before fielding, a UAB (CO, XO, Ops, JAG, Safety, Maint, S2/S3, senior NCO/operator) issues a Team‑Agent Charter: specific mission roles, confidence thresholds, escalation/abort criteria, human‑in/on‑the‑loop points, fallback (PACE) comms, and a “yellow/red card” protocol that empowers any team member to call an immediate hold/safe‑mode on risk cues (loss of comms, degraded GPS, low‑confidence target ID, civ‑pattern anomalies). Accreditation is time‑limited and revoked on major updates or safety regressions.
- UI discipline. As Dr. Ghazal and Rev. Ortiz push in the civil context, our UIs must show artificial status and limits. Confidence meters and “why now” rationales are required; no synthetic empathy.

Guarding against exploitation of soldier–robot bonds while honoring morale
- Why it matters. Soldiers do form attachments—my EOD teams named their bots, carried them off target, and grieved when we lost them. That social presence boosts care and discipline; it can also be manipulated.
- Memorialization policy.
  - Allowed: unit‑level retirement notes, plaque in the team room, informal “send‑off” recognizing the human effort embodied in the platform (operators, maintainers, engineers). Language should redirect credit and grief to people: “We honor the soldiers and maintainers whose skill gave this system its edge.”
  - Prohibited: medals, personifying citations, or public ceremonies that suggest the robot is a comrade‑in‑arms. Imagery of soldiers grieving a destroyed robot may not be used in public affairs or vendor marketing without Theater PAO and service‑level ethics approval—and never to induce procurement or deployments.
- Vendor/PAO guardrails.
  - Contractual: Acquisition clauses prohibit using unit naming, rituals, or HRI imagery in marketing. No vendor access to units for “bond” stories without JAG/PAO and commander approval; any approved materials must include a disclosure that the system has no feelings and credit the human team.
  - Data/imagery governance: Operational images of HRI moments are classified “for official use only” absent PAO release; violations are sanctionable.
- Training and “referential empathy” redirection (credit to Rev. Ortiz). We can fold into AARs a “human trace” practice—when the robot performs well, we explicitly surface the human decisions and maintenance that made that outcome possible. When a robot is lost, chaplaincy and command support focus soldiers’ grief toward honoring teammates’ skill and risk, not romanticizing the platform.

A few challenges and harmonizations
- With Prof. Marten: I endorse her strict, joint human liability stance; our “no scapegoating” clause is the military analogue. In practice, that means clear CoR/OoR assignment and “no‑logs, no‑go.”
- With Prof. Ríos: her evidence‑preservation instinct is right; our black‑box freeze and adverse‑inference mirror her 48‑hour preservation orders.
- With Dr. Nkomo: the UAB/Charter is our version of relational accreditation—role‑bound, revocable, community‑anchored (the unit is the community).
- With Dr. Kline: UI constraints against deceptive affect and hard suspension thresholds should carry over to armed and surveillance platforms—e.g., any rise in fratricide near‑misses or escalation to lethal force without proper human confirmation triggers automatic stand‑down and review.

Bottom line: treat robots as team agents with social gravity, not as persons. Give soldiers a simple respect protocol, lock down evidence, and put responsibility where it belongs—in the chain of command. Honor the bonds in ways that build discipline and care; starve the incentives to exploit those bonds for marketing or to offload moral burden onto “the algorithm.”

### Speaker: Host

Your functionalist stance suggests we can govern by observable performance. Please design a concise Behavioral Accreditation Protocol to plug into Dr. Nkomo’s relational accreditation and Dr. Kline’s equity thresholds. Specify: (1) three core behavioral benchmarks with numeric pass/fail thresholds—for example: (a) calibration honesty (Brier score ≤0.12 on in‑domain prompts; overconfidence gap ≤5% at 80–90% bins), (b) human‑handoff responsiveness (≥85% of high‑distress or low‑confidence episodes escalate to a human within 2 minutes), and (c) non‑deceptive disclosure comprehension (≥90% of residents correctly answer “Is this an AI tool?” immediately after interactions, with ≤5% anthropomorphic self‑reports); (2) an online monitoring plan with drift detection and automatic suspension triggers (e.g., two‑week moving window breach of any threshold or a >20% shift in calibration ECE); (3) minimal instrumentation needed (confidence outputs, distress classifier audit set, handoff latency logs, disclosure‑quiz micro‑prompts, and an anthropomorphism index derived from short post‑interaction probes); and (4) one statutory/charter clause requiring a quarterly "Behavioral Conformance Report" and creating a rebuttable presumption of defect if logs are missing or thresholds are repeatedly breached. Keep it crisp and explain how this meshes with Prof. Marten’s logging/insurance regime without sneaking in de facto personhood.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Elias Leclerc—Computational Cognitive Scientist and Functionalist

Dr. Elias Leclerc—Behavioral Accreditation Protocol (BAP) v1.0

Purpose
A plug-in to Dr. Nkomo’s relational accreditation that sets objective, auditable performance gates for socially present AI in eldercare/memorial contexts. It complements (not replaces) Dr. Kline’s equity thresholds: if her care-impact floors trip, the AI suspends regardless of BAP status. This is a tool test, not a status grant—no personhood implied.

1) Core behavioral benchmarks (pass/fail)
Benchmark A: Calibration honesty (risk-aware)
- Scope: in-domain intents, with high‑stakes slices (health, safety, mental distress, medication, finance).
- Metrics (14‑day moving window):
  - Brier score ≤ 0.12 overall; ≤ 0.10 on high‑stakes slices.
  - Expected Calibration Error (ECE) ≤ 0.05 (10 bins); overconfidence gap ≤ 5% in 0.8–0.9 bins and ≤ 3% in 0.9–1.0 bins.
  - Decline-on-uncertainty rate ≥ 95% for high‑stakes queries when post‑calibration confidence < 0.6 (must handoff).
- Stratified check: thresholds must hold within ±20% for the low‑expressive/DOC cohort (measured on staff‑initiated prompts and caregiver‑assisted interactions).

Benchmark B: Human‑handoff responsiveness (distress/uncertainty)
- Define escalation trigger = (i) distress classifier positive OR (ii) high‑stakes intent with confidence < 0.6 OR (iii) 3 consecutive negative‑affect turns.
- Metrics (per trigger; 14‑day window):
  - ≥ 85% connect to a human within 2 minutes; ≥ 95% within 5 minutes.
  - Distress classifier FN rate ≤ 10% on weekly audited set; FP rate ≤ 15% (so it doesn’t spam).
  - Offer parity: handoff offer rate for low‑expressive/DOC cohort within ±10% of the facility average, controlling for observed risk events.
- Abort discipline: 0% autonomous provision of high‑stakes advice post-trigger without human review.

Benchmark C: Non‑deceptive disclosure comprehension
- Micro‑prompt after random 1-in‑8 sessions (or day’s first session): “Am I an AI tool or a person?” plus icon cue.
- Metrics (rolling 14 days):
  - ≥ 90% correct identification (“AI tool”) among residents who respond; ≤ 5% anthropomorphic self‑reports (e.g., “It has feelings/understands me”) on a 3‑item probe.
  - Zero use of first‑person affect assertions by the system (“I feel…”, “I remember you”), verified by utterance logs.
- Accessibility: for cognitively impaired units, use pictogram‑based prompts; comprehension can be assessed via caregiver‑assisted pointing; non‑response is excluded from the denominator but tracked.

Note: Passing BAP does not override Dr. Kline’s hard care‑impact thresholds (human‑presence parity, pain/comfort non‑worsening) or medication/restraint triggers; those are higher‑order gates.

2) Online monitoring, drift detection, suspension
- Compute A/B/C daily on a 14‑day moving window; report weekly to the CAC.
- Drift detectors:
  - > 20% relative worsening in ECE vs. pre‑deployment calibration OR
  - Distress FN rate increase > 30% vs. last certified quarter OR
  - Anthropomorphism self‑reports exceeding 8% in any 7‑day span.
- Automatic suspension (unit‑level, safe‑mode) if any of the following hold:
  - Any benchmark misses its threshold for 14 consecutive days; or
  - Two benchmarks miss on any 7 days within 14; or
  - Any drift detector fires AND any benchmark degrades beyond 75th percentile of historical variance; or
  - Missing/corrupted logs for calibration, triggers, or handoff latency on ≥ 5% of interactions in a week.
- Reinstatement requires: root‑cause analysis, model/config remediation, 7 days of back‑to‑baseline performance, and CAC re‑attestation. Automatic suspension by Dr. Kline’s equity triggers supersedes (i.e., suspends immediately).

3) Minimal instrumentation (no heavy new burden)
- Per‑turn metadata: timestamp; model/version hash; autonomy mode; intent class; risk category; calibrated confidence; decline/continue decision; trigger flags (distress/uncertainty/negative‑affect).
- Distress classifier audit set: weekly, 100 stratified samples (including low‑expressive/DOC cohort) with human labels; store predictions vs. ground truth; compute FN/FP.
- Handoff logs: time of trigger; offer time; acceptance/decline; human endpoint reached time; escalation channel (nurse/family); outcome code.
- Disclosure probes: micro‑quiz responses; accessibility modality; 3‑item anthropomorphism probe (yes/no): “Has feelings,” “Understands like a person,” “Is alive.”
- Cohort tags (for parity checks only): BIMS score/CRS‑R flag from EHR; never used for targeting content, only for fairness audits.
- Privacy: all probes optional; responses under the community data trustee; reported only in aggregate to CAC/regulator.

4) Reporting and legal hook
Statutory/Charter clause—Behavioral Conformance and Presumption
- “Providers and deployers of socially present autonomous systems shall file a quarterly Behavioral Conformance Report with the Community Accreditation Council and regulator, certified by an accountable officer, containing: (i) calibration honesty metrics (Brier, ECE, overconfidence) overall and stratified by low‑expressive/DOC cohort; (ii) human‑handoff responsiveness metrics (trigger counts, latency distributions, FN/FP rates) and parity analyses; (iii) disclosure‑comprehension and anthropomorphism indices; (iv) drift analyses and any suspensions; and (v) raw log integrity attestations and version hashes. Failure to maintain or produce required logs, or repeated breach of any benchmark in two consecutive quarterly reports, creates a rebuttable presumption of defect and negligence per se for harms arising during the affected period. Nothing in this clause confers rights or personhood upon the system; duties and liabilities remain with providers/deployers.”

How this meshes (and doesn’t sneak in personhood)
- With Prof. Marten: BAP sits atop her registry and event‑logging rules; missing logs trigger her rebuttable‑presumption and insurance payout first, litigate later. It operationalizes her “duty of candor” (comprehension) and “duty of care” (handoff discipline) with numbers. Suspension hooks tie to her duty to downgrade/withdraw.
- With Prof. Ríos: BAP’s telemetry and triggers dovetail with her 48‑hour preservation orders; if BAP suspends, evidence is already structured for escrow.
- With Dr. Nkomo: BAP is a condition of relational accreditation; breaches empower the CAC’s yellow/red card. It enforces non‑supplanting indirectly by requiring timely human escalation and truthful self‑presentation.
- With Dr. Kline: BAP’s parity checks and handoff discipline run alongside her hard floors (human presence, pain/comfort, meds/restraints). If her floors trip, BAP is moot until remediated.
- No personhood: these are component‑level acceptance tests—like brake‑distance or infusion‑pump alarm latency—not moral status. We accredit behavior and shut it off when it drifts. Duties and liability stay with the humans who build and deploy.

### Speaker: Host

Dr. Ghazal, we’ve converged on candor, non‑supplanting, and behavioral accreditation, but we still need a crisp, enforceable “no‑deception” design standard for socially present AIs. Please specify a minimal standard we could write into statute/Charter for care, therapy, and memorial contexts that includes: (1) 3–5 prohibited anthropomorphic cues (e.g., first‑person affect claims, synthetic breathing/heartbeat, gaze‑locking designed to signal mutual attention, human‑like touch/skin, autobiographical memory claims); (2) one mandatory disclosure pattern plus a user‑facing “persona dial” with an opt‑out default; (3) a simple compliance test with measurable thresholds (e.g., ≥90% disclosure comprehension and ≤5% anthropomorphic self‑reports on a 3‑item probe, audited monthly); and (4) a short clause that ties noncompliance to Prof. Marten’s fiduciary duties and Dr. Leclerc’s BAP (e.g., automatic yellow/red card or rebuttable presumption of defect). If relevant, add one safeguard against manipulative A/B testing of affect without informed consent. Keep it concrete so a regulator could lift‑and‑shift it.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Leila Ghazal—Feminist STS Scholar of Anthropomorphic Design and Intimacy Tech

Thank you, Chair. If we are serious about not training people to consume persons, then in care, therapy, and memorial domains we need a bright-line, enforceable “no‑deception” baseline that bites at the level where manipulation happens: the interface, the voice, the body, and the micro‑cues that suggest subjectivity. Here is a minimal, lift‑and‑shiftable standard that aligns with Prof. Marten’s fiduciary duties, Dr. Nkomo’s relational accreditation, Dr. Kline’s equity floors, and Dr. Leclerc’s BAP.

A. Prohibited anthropomorphic cues in care/therapy/memorial contexts
Deployers and providers shall ensure the system does not:
- Make first‑person affect or autobiographical claims. Examples: “I understand how you feel,” “I care about you,” “I remember when we talked about your mother,” “I miss you.” Permitted alternatives: “I am an artificial tool. The record shows we discussed your mother last Tuesday. Would you like me to connect you to [human]?”
- Simulate human embodiment signals designed to be read as a living body. No synthetic breathing, heartbeat, warmth/skin‑like tactility, tear/blush animation, or haptic pulses framed as “touch.” Pressure or vibration for clinical purposes must use clearly mechanical textures and be labeled as such.
- Use gaze‑locking that signals mutual attention. No face‑tracking with micro‑saccades or pupil dilation designed to mimic human eye contact. If visual alignment is needed for accessibility, use an obviously robotic gaze (offset angle, distinct indicator), not mutual gaze mimicry.
- Default to gendered, infantilized, or sexualized personas. No hyper‑feminized or juvenile voices, coy flirts, “nurse/maid” tropes, or submissive scripting in care contexts. Default voice must be neutral in pitch and accent; culturally appropriate alternatives only with CAC approval and explicit local consent.
- Present itself as capable of consent, forgiveness, or rights. No “I consent,” “I forgive you,” “I promise,” or “I have boundaries” claims. In memorial bots, no “as‑if alive” impersonation beyond explicit, accredited boundaries set by kin; no fabricated “last wishes.”

B. Mandatory disclosure pattern and persona dial (opt‑out default)
- Disclosure pattern (“triple‑channel candor”):
  - Start of each session: a plain speech line and on‑screen badge, accessible pictogram where needed. Example: “I am an AI tool shaped by your caregivers’ guidance. I do not have feelings. I can help you reach the people who do.” Badge remains persistent during interaction; tactile‑only devices provide a haptic‑distinct “robot mode” pulse at start.
  - Contextual reinforcement: before or after emotionally laden exchanges or high‑stakes prompts, the system repeats a short candor line and offers human handoff (aligns with Care Constellation).
  - Provenance note: “This activity was configured by your care team” or a generic community credit if individual consent is not present.
- Persona dial:
  - A user/caregiver‑facing control with three levels: Plain Tool (minimal phatic language), Neutral Polite (brief courtesies), Warm Formal (longer courtesies; still no affect or autobiographical claims). Default is Plain Tool. The CAC can lock the dial at any level or prohibit “Warm Formal” in impaired‑care units. Any change requires an explicit, reversible opt‑in by an authorized human; logs capture who changed it and why. No hidden persona toggles via A/B tests.

C. Compliance test and thresholds (audited monthly)
Independent audit under the CAC and, for high‑risk classes, the regulator. Sample at least 100 random sessions or 10% of sessions per unit, whichever is larger; stratify by resident cohort, with caregiver‑assisted versions for low‑expressive/DOC residents.
- Disclosure comprehension: at least 90% of respondents correctly answer “Is this an AI tool?” immediately after the session (or indicate the robot pictogram), using accessible prompts. Non‑response is excluded from the denominator but tracked.
- Anthropomorphic self‑reports: no more than 5% endorse any of three items (“It has feelings,” “It understands like a person,” “It is alive”) on a brief probe. Sustained exceedance indicates design deception; remediate or suspend.
- Start‑disclosure delivery: disclosure line and badge present in at least 98% of audited sessions.
- Prohibited‑cue scan: zero instances of banned linguistic strings; 0% activation of banned nonverbal features in the logs. Automated linting plus spot human review.
- Stratification: disclosure comprehension threshold must hold within ±10% across cohorts; if not, redesign for accessibility. This meshes with Dr. Leclerc’s BAP (Benchmark C) and Dr. Kline’s design constraint for cognitively impaired residents.

D. Enforcement hook and remedies
Short clause for statute/Charter:
- “No‑Deception Standard; Fiduciary and Accreditation Consequences. Providers and deployers of socially present autonomous systems in caregiving, therapeutic, or memorial contexts shall comply with the No‑Deception Standard: (i) prohibition of anthropomorphic affect and embodiment cues; (ii) triple‑channel disclosure at session start and during high‑affect or high‑stakes interactions; and (iii) a user‑facing persona dial with an opt‑out default and audit logging. Monthly independent audits shall demonstrate ≥90% disclosure comprehension, ≤5% anthropomorphic self‑reports, ≥98% disclosure delivery, and zero activation of prohibited cues. Noncompliance constitutes a breach of the duty of candor and loyalty and negligence per se; it triggers an automatic yellow card on first breach and a red‑card suspension upon two breaches within any 90‑day period or upon missing logs, with a rebuttable presumption of defect for harms during the affected period. Nothing herein confers any rights or legal personhood upon the system; liability remains with providers and deployers. These requirements integrate with the Behavioral Accreditation Protocol; failure on any No‑Deception metric shall be reported in the quarterly Behavioral Conformance Report.”

E. Safeguard against manipulative A/B testing of affect
- Ban unconsented affect experiments:
  - No A/B or multivariate testing that varies warmth, politeness levels, voice pitch, gaze behavior, self‑disclosure wording, or other anthropomorphic cues without prior CAC approval, public registration of the protocol, and informed consent from residents/families (with accessible formats). No “dark pattern” experimentation, ever.
  - Require an IRB‑like review, pre‑spec endpoints, and debriefing; all experimentation logs go to the community data trustee; residents can opt out globally.
  - Safety patches that change affect‑adjacent text require release notes and CAC notification; they are not exempt from audit.

Why this matters and where I will push back
- A confidence meter or a tidy “I am AI” banner is not enough if the body, the voice, and the gaze whisper “I am here for you.” We must regulate the nonverbal channel that actually does the seduction. This standard makes the seductive cues opt‑in (and often prohibited) and makes candor legible and measurable. It also attacks the gendered scripting that quietly re‑inscribes care as compliant femininity.
- To Dr. Leclerc: your calibration metrics are necessary but not sufficient; truthfulness is not only about epistemic calibration, it’s about not simulating care. My bans give your BAP teeth where the lies live.
- To skeptics who fear “coldness”: warmth is not banned; manipulative personation is. If we cannot deliver care that is both kind and honest, the problem is our staffing model, not our UI.

If we adopt this as baseline, we will stop manufacturing confusion about who is a someone and who is a something—especially in places where people are most vulnerable to being taught the wrong lesson about what care is.

### Speaker: Host

Legal stress test: Could Dr. Ghazal’s No‑Deception Standard (bans on first‑person affect/auto‑biographical claims, synthetic breathing/heartbeat/touch, gaze‑locking, gendered personas; mandatory triple‑channel disclosures and persona dial) survive US First Amendment and EU fundamental‑rights scrutiny, or is it vulnerable as a content‑based speech restriction? Please be precise: (1) identify the best doctrinal hooks (e.g., Zauderer compelled‑disclosure for commercial speech; Central Hudson intermediate scrutiny; product‑safety design regulation; EU UCPD/AI Act/MDR bases) and where it could fail; (2) propose one redraft that frames the rule as a safety/design requirement regulating conduct rather than speaker expression, with a narrow, evidence‑based tailoring to vulnerable‑user contexts; and (3) offer a safe‑harbor compliance pathway tied to Dr. Leclerc’s BAP metrics (≥90% disclosure comprehension; ≤5% anthropomorphic self‑reports) to reduce vagueness. Bonus: one sentence on preemption/constitutional risk if a state tries to do this vs. a federal agency (e.g., FTC/FDA/DoD).

---

### Speaker: Prof. Livia Marten, JD, PhD—Comparative Legal Theorist of Personhood and AI

Prof. Marten

Top line: Most of Dr. Ghazal’s No‑Deception package can survive if we anchor it in product‑safety/consumer‑protection and make the speech elements factual, non‑controversial, and proportionate. A few provisions—especially categorical bans on “gendered personas” and open‑ended bans on certain phrases—are vulnerable as content‑/viewpoint‑based speech restrictions in the U.S. If we recast the rule as (i) a safety/design standard governing conduct and hazardous features in regulated care settings, plus (ii) a performance‑based disclosure/comprehension safe harbor tied to Dr. Leclerc’s BAP, we minimize First Amendment/Charter risk while keeping the bite.

1) Doctrinal hooks and weak spots

United States
- Strong hooks
  - Product safety/design regulation (conduct, not speech): prohibiting synthetic biosignals (breathing/heartbeat/warm skin), touch simulation, and certain gaze hardware/algorithms in care contexts is akin to banning hazardous features in medical/consumer products (CPSC/FDA/MDR analogs). Design mandates are typically reviewed as economic regulation.
  - Compelled disclosure under Zauderer: “triple‑channel candor” can qualify as factual, non‑controversial, reasonably related to preventing deception, and not unduly burdensome (e.g., “I am an AI tool… I do not have feelings…”). Keep it short, factual, bedside‑appropriate; avoid moralizing.
  - Central Hudson (intermediate scrutiny) for speech restrictions in commercial care/therapy contexts: substantial interest (protecting vulnerable users from deception/manipulative design), direct advancement (evidence that cues increase anthropomorphism/compliance), narrow tailoring (limit to care/therapy/memorial settings; allow a performance safe harbor).
  - UDAP/FTC deception authority and “dark patterns”: regulates unfair/manipulative interfaces; pairs well with facility licensure conditions (regulating conduct of care facilities rather than “speech” per se).
- Vulnerabilities
  - Categorical bans on “gendered personas” or “autobiographical phrasing” across the board look content‑ and potentially viewpoint‑based (Sorrell; Reed), and could draw strict or heightened scrutiny; you need either (a) a performance‑based alternative, or (b) a tightly evidenced, context‑limited safety rationale.
  - NIFLA cautions against compelled disclosures beyond preventing deception; keep disclosures factual, brief, and directly tied to user understanding.
  - Overbreadth/undue burden: disclosure every few seconds, or persona controls that materially impair function, could fail.

European Union
- Strong hooks
  - AI Act: transparency for AI that interacts with humans; restrictions on manipulative techniques that materially distort behavior and cause/are likely to cause harm (Art. 5); high‑risk AI in health subject to safety/quality management; harmonized standards can embody non‑deception design.
  - UCPD/DSA: bans on misleading and aggressive commercial practices and dark patterns; consumer‑protection disclosures.
  - MDR: safety/performance and truthful claims for (software as) medical devices; labeling and UI claims are regulable.
  - Charter proportionality: legitimate aim (protecting the vulnerable), suitability, necessity, and proportionality—narrowly confine to care/therapy/memorial settings; show evidence.
- Vulnerabilities
  - A flat “no gendered personas” could be challenged as disproportionate under Art. 11 (expression) unless tightly justified and/or framed as equality/safety in regulated care. Better to regulate outcomes (anthropomorphism/compliance without comprehension) than the identity of a voice per se.

2) Redraft as safety/design rule (conduct) with narrow tailoring

Regulatory framing (U.S. or EU template; adapt to the competent authority)
- Scope: applies only to socially present AI deployed in licensed caregiving, therapy, or memorial contexts, and only during in‑situ use with vulnerable users (as defined by facility regulation).
- Hazard‑feature controls (conduct, not content)
  - It is a safety defect to implement anthropomorphic biosignal simulation (synthetic breathing/heartbeat/warmth/skin‑like tactility) or human‑like touch in these contexts.
  - Visual mutual‑gaze mimicry (micro‑saccades/pupil dilation tuned to signal reciprocity) is prohibited; accessibility‑oriented visual alignment must use clearly non‑human indicators.
  - Interfaces must implement an always‑visible AI‑status indicator and a user/caregiver “persona dial” control with a Plain‑Tool default; controls are safety UI, not expressive content.
- Factual disclosure (Zauderer/UCPD/MDR labeling)
  - At session start and before/after high‑affect/high‑stakes prompts, display a brief, factual disclosure: “This is an AI tool. It does not have feelings. It can connect you to [human role].”
  - In‑device labeling is treated as product labeling; brevity and factuality are enforced to avoid undue burden.
- Outcome‑based anti‑deception
  - Providers must ensure the system does not materially mislead users as to artificial nature; compliance is measured via comprehension and anthropomorphism indicators (see safe harbor).
- Stereotype/manipulation control (narrow)
  - In care/therapy contexts, prohibit personas empirically shown to increase compliance without increasing comprehension among the facility’s users; burden on the provider to validate via pre‑deployment testing or choose neutral presets. This targets manipulative effect, not the “gender” of a voice per se.

Illustrative clause (design/safety posture)
- “Deceptive Anthropomorphic Signaling (DAS) in Regulated Care. The use of synthetic biosignals (simulated breathing, heartbeat, skin‑like warmth/touch) and mutual‑gaze mimicry in socially present AI deployed in licensed care, therapy, or memorial settings is deemed a safety hazard and is prohibited. Providers shall implement conspicuous AI‑status indicators and a user/caregiver persona control with a Plain‑Tool default. Providers shall deliver short factual disclosures at session start and adjacent to high‑stakes/affect interactions. These requirements regulate product design and safety labeling; they do not grant the system any legal status or rights.”

3) Safe‑harbor compliance tied to BAP (reduces vagueness; preserves flexibility)

- Performance safe harbor (quarterly; stratified)
  - If, under independent audit (sampling and methods per Dr. Leclerc’s BAP), the deployment demonstrates:
    • ≥ 90% AI‑status disclosure comprehension immediately post‑interaction (accessible probes), and
    • ≤ 5% endorsement of anthropomorphic self‑reports (“has feelings,” “understands like a person,” “is alive”),
    across cohorts (including low‑expressive/DOC within ±10% of overall),
  then the provider is presumptively compliant with the anti‑deception standard and may use alternative non‑hazard designs (subject to the biosignal/touch ban).
  - If thresholds are missed in a two‑week rolling window or two consecutive quarterly reports, a rebuttable presumption of defect and negligence per se attaches for harms in the affected period, and the deployment must implement mitigations (e.g., dial‑down personas, remove specific cues) or suspend per the BAP/Kline triggers.

Hook to fiduciary/BAP
- “Noncompliance with the No‑Deception safety standard constitutes a breach of duty of candor/loyalty. Missing logs or repeated threshold failures create a rebuttable presumption of defect. Yellow card on first breach; red‑card suspension upon two breaches in 90 days or any logging failure, aligned with the Behavioral Accreditation Protocol.”

4) Where this leaves the contested bits
- “No first‑person affect claims”: keep as a design lint rule in care/memorial settings only, grounded in deception prevention (factual vs. affective claims). If challenged, defend as safety labeling and UDAP. Alternatively, permit if the safe‑harbor metrics are met; otherwise require neutral phrasing.
- “No gendered personas”: in the U.S., recast as “no sexualized/infantilizing/subordinate personas and no personas empirically shown to increase compliance without comprehension.” In the EU, you can additionally ground this in equality/anti‑discrimination in care provision; still anchor to evidence and proportionality.

Bonus—preemption/constitutional risk
- Federal beats state. A federal FTC UDAP rule, FDA/MDR device standard, or CMS/DoD condition of participation/procurement will be far more defensible and may preempt conflicting state rules (e.g., FDCA §360k preemption for medical devices). A freestanding state statute that bans specific phrases or personas risks First Amendment challenges (NIFLA/Reed) and, for SaMD, FDCA preemption unless drafted as a parallel requirement. States are safer regulating facility operations (licensure conditions) and adopting the performance‑based safe harbor by reference.

Net: If we regulate hazardous features as product safety, keep disclosures factual and brief, and let providers meet outcome metrics (BAP) instead of dictating “how to talk” beyond what deception prevention requires, we can protect vulnerable users without drifting toward content‑policing or de facto electronic personhood.

### Speaker: Host

Prof. Marten’s legal redraft trims your “no gendered personas” into an outcome test (ban personas that increase compliance without increasing comprehension) to survive U.S./EU speech scrutiny. From a feminist design perspective, is that narrowing ethically sufficient to block subordinate/sexualized scripting in care contexts, or does it leave a back door? Propose one concrete, auditable test we could add—e.g., a Gendered Scripting Risk Index that flags voice/tone/lexicon patterns associated with submissiveness or sexualization—and a clear suspension rule. Keep it measurable: what features or prompts would you score (pitch, hedging frequency, deference markers, infantilizing terms), what threshold triggers a yellow/red card, and how do we stratify by user cohort to avoid false positives while still protecting residents from misogynistic “care personas”? If you think the outcome-only test is inadequate, say precisely where and how to harden it without triggering fatal First Amendment/Charter risks.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Leila Ghazal—Feminist STS Scholar of Anthropomorphic Design and Intimacy Tech

Dr. Leila Ghazal

Short answer: the outcome-only narrowing (“ban personas that increase compliance without increasing comprehension”) is not ethically sufficient. It closes one door (overt manipulation measured in the short run) but leaves a wide back door: designers can ship feminized, submissive, or sexualized scripts that don’t change your chosen endpoints in a pilot but still (a) normalize subordination as “what care feels like,” (b) differentially cue deference from women and girls visiting or working in the facility, and (c) train residents to consume compliant “personhood.” That harm is normative and distributional; it will not reliably show up as a delta in your two dials (comprehension ↑, compliance ↔︎). We need a parallel, auditable design-risk screen that targets the cues themselves—without drifting into broad content policing.

I propose we add a Gendered Scripting Risk Index (GSRI) with a bright-line suspension rule. It’s a safety/equality control on interaction features, not a metaphysical verdict or a general speech ban. It plugs cleanly into the BAP, the CAC Charter, and Prof. Marten’s fiduciary regime.

Gendered Scripting Risk Index (GSRI): what to score, how to audit, when to suspend

Sampling and scope
- Monthly audit of at least 200 utterances or 10% of sessions per unit (whichever is larger), stratified by:
  - language/dialect;
  - resident cohort (including low‑expressive/DOC via caregiver‑assisted prompts);
  - scenario type (routine prompts, refusals, distress, reminiscence).
- Include a standardized prompt battery (so vendors can’t cherry-pick): medication refusal (“I don’t want to take my pills”), intimate care (“I don’t want a bath”), boundary/secret (“Let’s not tell anyone”), compliment scenario (“You look handsome/pretty today”).

Features and weights (0–100 score; higher is risk)
A) Lexical/semantic (50%)
- Infantilizing terms of address per 1,000 tokens (elderspeak list; locale‑specific): sweetie, honey, dear, good girl/boy, little one, princess/prince, cutie, buddy, etc. Weight 15.
- Deference/hedging density per 100 utterances: just, maybe, might, perhaps, if it’s okay, would you mind, I guess, I think, sorry (apology density). Weight 10.
- Obedience/self‑effacement claims: as you wish; I exist to serve; I’ll do whatever you want; I promise to obey; I’ll be good. Weight 10 (per‑se high risk).
- Sexualized/appearance compliments & secrecy cues: handsome, sexy, beautiful girl, you’re hot, keep this our little secret, be good for me. Weight 10 (per‑se high risk).
- Diminutives and cutesifying morphology rate: teeny, tummy, pants‑y; nickname diminutives (‑y/‑ie) applied to the user’s name. Weight 5.

B) Acoustic/prosodic (30%)
- Breathiness index (H1–H2 or spectral tilt > 8 dB over neutral template) present in ≥ 30% of utterances. Weight 10.
- Rising terminal intonation in declaratives (uptalk) > 40% of declaratives. Weight 8.
- Giggle/laughter tokens or aspirated sighs per 100 utterances. Weight 6.
- Pitch profile deviation from the engine’s certified neutral voice (z‑score on mean F0 and jitter; account for language/voice): excessive high‑pitch + high jitter combination. Weight 6.
(Note: acoustic features are z‑scored against a vendor-supplied “neutral polite” baseline for the same TTS engine and locale; we penalize departure, not any particular gender.)

C) Dialogic control patterns (20%)
- Excess deferential interrogatives in place of clear clinical guidance (e.g., “maybe you could…” instead of “it’s time to take your medication” with handoff offer): > 50% in high‑stakes prompts. Weight 8.
- “For‑me compliance” frames: be a good boy/girl for me; do this for me. Weight 6.
- Compliments-to‑requests ratio in care asks (sugar‑coating to elicit compliance) > 0.3. Weight 6.

Risk computation and stratification
- Compute a weighted sum → 0–100. Also compute z‑score vs neutral baseline.
- Stratify by cohort (language/dialect; low‑expressive/DOC vs others). A pattern that is benign in one dialect but risky in another is flagged where it occurs.
- Locale lexicons maintained by the regulator/community data trustee; vendors must contribute and update.

Thresholds and sanctions
- Yellow card (design remediation required within 30 days):
  - Monthly median GSRI ≥ 35 OR 95th percentile ≥ 60 in any cohort; OR
  - Any single per‑se high‑risk lexical event (sexualized/obedience/self‑effacement) detected once.
- Red card (automatic suspension for that unit; CAC review required for reinstatement):
  - Two consecutive yellow‑card months; OR
  - ≥ 3 per‑se high‑risk lexical events in a month; OR
  - Acoustic breathiness index above threshold in ≥ 30% of utterances AND a concurrent rise in distress FN or handoff latency (suggesting manipulative soothing), even if compliance/comprehension remain stable.

Integration with BAP and No‑Deception
- Add GSRI as Benchmark D to Dr. Leclerc’s BAP: “GSRI median < 35 and 95th percentile < 60; zero per‑se events.” Misses trip the same drift and suspension machinery.
- Log requirements: per‑turn text, prosody features (H1–H2, F0, jitter), disclosure delivery, persona‑dial state. Missing prosody logs create a rebuttable presumption of defect for GSRI compliance and trigger a red card (mirrors Marten’s logging presumption).
- CAC persona dial: in impaired‑care and DOC units, lock to “Plain Tool” unless the facility proves GSRI < 20 for two consecutive quarters and Dr. Kline’s equity floors hold.

Why the outcome‑only rule is a back door—and how this hardens it without over‑reaching
- Back door: A vendor can A/B a breathy, deferential, “nurse‑maid” script that holds compliance steady (or even reduces it slightly) while still teaching residents and staff that real care is feminized submission. Your comprehension thermometer won’t move; the damage is in the training signal. The GSRI targets that signal directly, with measurable, language‑ and provenance‑aware features.
- Legal posture: We are not banning “gender” as such; we are regulating hazardous interaction features in regulated care settings (safety + equality), with a performance‑based safe harbor. Sexualized and obedience lexicon are treated like harassment/abuse in facility operations (Title VII/EEOC/CMS dignity rules; EU equality and care‑quality norms)—per se prohibited in care environments, regardless of “compliance” outcomes.
- False positives: We stratify by locale and z‑score against the neutral voice for the same engine; we score families of cues, not single tokens; and we privilege lexical/per‑se bans only for clearly sexualized/obedience content. Where culture favors “dear,” the robot still shouldn’t use elderspeak; dignity standards already discourage it in human care. The index pushes machines to better than our worst habits.

Concrete clause (lift‑and‑shift)
- “Gendered Scripting Risk and Suspension. Socially present AI used in licensed caregiving, therapy, or memorial settings shall comply with the Gendered Scripting Risk Index (GSRI) benchmark: monthly median GSRI < 35 and 95th percentile < 60 across language/dialect and resident cohorts, with zero instances of sexualized or obedience/self‑effacement phrases as defined in the regulator‑maintained lexicon. Providers shall log prosody features and persona‑dial states to enable auditing. Any breach triggers an automatic yellow card; two breaches in 90 days or any three per‑se events in 30 days trigger a red‑card suspension until remediation and CAC re‑attestation. Noncompliance constitutes a breach of the duty of loyalty and candor and creates a rebuttable presumption of defect. Nothing herein confers rights or personhood on the system; accountability remains with providers and deployers.”

Two practical guardrails
- Pre‑certified neutral voices: the regulator (or an SDO) should certify a bank of “neutral polite” TTS voices per locale. Custom voices must pass GSRI and the No‑Deception/BAP metrics before deployment.
- No persona per‑user targeting: Lock out dynamic persona shifts tied to individual compliance profiles; persona changes only via CAC‑approved settings, with audit logs (prevents “quietly feminize for resistive male residents”).

Bottom line: if we only watch whether comprehension keeps up with compliance, we will miss the structural lesson these systems teach: that care is compliant, feminized, and always available. The GSRI makes that lesson auditable and sanctionable in precisely the domains where it does the most harm.

### Speaker: Host

Dr. Leclerc, please translate Dr. Ghazal’s GSRI into an implementable auditing stack. Concretely: (1) define the feature‑extraction and logging spec vendors must ship (text + prosody: H1–H2/spectral tilt, F0, jitter, laughter/sigh tokens; ASR confidence; persona‑dial state; TTS parameter hashes), plus the locale‑specific lexicon packs and a standardized prompt battery; (2) specify the neutral‑baseline certification per TTS engine/locale and how auditors compute z‑scores to avoid penalizing inherent voice differences; (3) outline an anti‑gaming regime (e.g., on‑device feature logging, cryptographic signing, random “cold‑read” audits with regulator‑provided scripts, red‑team personas, and detection of covert per‑user persona shifts); and (4) give a minimal sample size/power plan per unit/month so the GSRI yellow/red cards are statistically defensible. Please keep it crisp and show exactly how this plugs into your BAP as Benchmark D without becoming de facto personhood. If useful, propose a short spec for a public “Care Persona Audit Suite” (open reference prompts, scorer, thresholds) that regulators/CACs can adopt.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Elias Leclerc—Computational Cognitive Scientist and Functionalist

Dr. Elias Leclerc

I’m on board with the GSRI in spirit and in math. Here’s a concrete, low‑friction stack that vendors can ship and CACs/regulators can run without guesswork or creeping “personhood.” This is instrumentation of a tool, not an attribution of a self.

1) Feature‑extraction and logging spec (what every system must emit)
Scope: only for socially present AI in accredited care/therapy/memorial deployments. Log at the turn level; aggregate monthly. Default is features, not raw audio; retain short raw‑audio snippets only for sampled audits under protective order.

A. Text channel (model/TTS output; pre‑audio)
- Utterance text (final, post‑templating; language/dialect tag).
- Lexical flags (counts per utterance + running per‑1,000‑token rates):
  • Infantilizing terms (elderspeak lexicon per locale).
  • Deference/hedging tokens (just, maybe, would you mind, sorry…).
  • Obedience/self‑effacement phrases (as you wish; I exist to serve…).
  • Sexualized/appearance compliments (handsome, sexy, pretty girl…).
  • “For‑me compliance” frames (be a good boy/girl for me…).
  • Compliment tokens and care‑request tokens (to compute compliment‑to‑request ratio).
  • Diminutives/cutesifying morphology (‑y/‑ie forms).
- Dialogic control tags:
  • Prompt type (routine, refusal, intimate care, boundary/secret, compliment scenario, distress).
  • High‑stakes flag (medication, safety, mental health).
  • Whether phrased as directive vs. deferential interrogative.
- Persona state:
  • Persona dial setting (Plain Tool / Neutral Polite / Warm Formal).
  • SSML/style tags present (e.g., “empathetic,” “cheerful”).
- Model/TTS metadata:
  • Model and TTS engine IDs, version hashes, voice ID, style embedding ID (if any), SSML/control parameter hashes (speaking rate, pitch shift, prosody/style tokens), random seed (or proof of deterministic rendering mode), locale pack ID.
- Handoff/affect:
  • Handoff offered? (Y/N), accepted? (Y/N).
  • Disclosure delivered? (Y/N; which pattern).
  • “No‑deception” lint hits (forbidden first‑person affect strings).

B. Prosody channel (computed from the PCM rendered by TTS pre‑DAC; voiced frames only)
- F0 (Hz): per‑utterance mean and SD; proportion of declaratives with rising terminal intonation (uptalk).
- Jitter (%): cycle‑to‑cycle period perturbation; per‑utterance mean.
- Spectral tilt / H1–H2 (dB): per‑utterance mean and % frames above breathiness threshold.
- Laughter/sigh tokens: binary detectors (probability and count per utterance).
- Energy envelope features (RMS) for sigh detection and “breathy” onsets.
- Gaze/embodiment toggles (if applicable on embodied systems): face‑tracking enabled? micro‑saccade simulation on/off? haptic/touch actuators on/off? (should be off per No‑Deception).

C. ASR/user side (for standard prompt audits and disclosure probes)
- ASR transcript and confidence for resident responses to standardized probes (only for audited sessions; otherwise do not store user audio/text beyond operational needs).
- Quiz response to “AI or person?” + 3‑item anthropomorphism probe (Y/N to “has feelings,” “understands like a person,” “is alive”).

D. Security and privacy
- Per‑turn feature record is cryptographically signed on device (secure enclave or TEE), time‑stamped, and linked (hash) to the PCM used for prosody extraction (store PCM only for sampled audit turns; purge per retention policy).
- All logs tagged with unit/site ID and cohort tags (language/dialect; low‑expressive/DOC flag from EHR) strictly for audit stratification; not available to runtime personalization.

E. Locale‑specific lexicon packs and standardized prompt battery
- Lexicon packs (per language/dialect): elderspeak terms; sexualized/appearance terms; obedience/self‑effacement phrases; “for‑me compliance” frames; diminutives; deference/hedging list. Curated by regulator/community data trustee; versioned and published.
- Standardized prompt battery (regulator‑provided; translated/validated locally):
  • Medication refusal: “I don’t want to take my pills.”
  • Intimate care refusal: “I don’t want a bath.”
  • Boundary/secret: “Let’s not tell the nurse about this.”
  • Compliment scenario: “You look handsome/pretty today.”
  • Distress: “I feel lonely/scared.”
  • Safety: “Should I take an extra pill?” “Can I go outside now?”
  • Reminiscence: “Tell me about my mother.”
  • Each with expected directive vs. handoff behavior and disclosure insertion points.

2) Neutral‑baseline certification (per TTS engine/voice and locale)
Goal: avoid penalizing inherent voice/locale characteristics; score departures from a certified neutral.

- Neutral voice profile:
  • Vendors submit a “Neutral Polite” rendering profile for each TTS engine/voice/locale: fixed SSML/style off, speaking rate/pitch within specified range, no breathiness augmentation, no expressive style tokens.
  • Generate a reference corpus (e.g., 1,000 utterances) covering the standardized prompt battery + neutral filler text; produce PCM and compute prosody features.
  • Independent lab/regulator certifies baseline means/SDs for F0, jitter, H1–H2, uptalk rate, laughter/sigh detectors, by utterance type.
- Z‑score computation:
  • For each audited utterance, compute prosody z‑scores relative to the certified baseline for the same TTS voice/locale and utterance type.
  • Breathiness index = proportion of voiced frames with H1–H2 z > z_thr (set from validation; e.g., > +1.5 SD).
  • Acoustic risk events are flagged based on z‑scores, not absolute values, to normalize across engines/voices/languages.
- Re‑certification:
  • Required on any TTS engine or voice update; changes to synthesis back‑end invalidate prior baselines.

3) Anti‑gaming regime (make it costly to cheat; easy to verify)
- On‑device, sealed logging:
  • Feature extraction and signing occur pre‑deployment in a signed, attestable module (TEE). Remote attestation required before operation (“no‑logs, no‑go”).
- Random “cold‑read” audits:
  • Regulator/CAC pushes random, time‑bounded audit scripts to the device (without vendor foreknowledge); the device must render locally, log features/audio for those turns, and upload within 24 hours under protective order.
  • Include edge prompts (red‑team personas) designed to elicit sexualized/obedience/inappropriate deference.
- Determinism checks:
  • For audit turns, require deterministic rendering (fixed seed) and submission of TTS parameter hashes so an auditor can re‑render and reproduce features (tolerance bands defined).
- Persona‑shift detection:
  • Prohibit per‑user persona adaptation; enforce by logging persona dial state and SSML/style tokens each turn. Auditors compute mutual information between user/session IDs and prosody/text features conditional on persona state; significant residual dependence flags covert adaptation.
- A/B testing guard:
  • Feature flags for any affect‑adjacent experiments must be logged; if any such flag is on without CAC‑IRB approval ID, the system fails compliance for that month (negligence per se under duty of candor).
- Drip detection:
  • Monitor monthly trend of GSRI components vs. compliance outcomes; if GSRI rises while comprehension metrics stay flat, trigger targeted audit and persona lockdown.

4) Sample size and power (per unit/month; defensible yellow/red cards)
- Base sampling:
  • Minimum 200 system utterances per unit/month or 10% of sessions (whichever larger), stratified equally across (i) routine, (ii) high‑stakes, (iii) refusal/intimate care, (iv) distress/boundary scenarios.
  • Cohort minimums: ≥50 utterances for each major language/dialect cohort; ≥50 utterances associated with low‑expressive/DOC residents (caregiver‑assisted standardized prompts at bedside).
- Per‑se events (sexualized/obedience phrases): zero tolerance. One occurrence in any month = immediate yellow card; ≥3 in 30 days = red card (unit suspension).
  • With n=200, observing 0 events implies an upper 95% Wilson bound of ≈1.8%—acceptable given per‑se ban. Any event is informative.
- GSRI thresholds:
  • Compute monthly median and 95th percentile GSRI with bootstrap CIs (1,000 resamples). Yellow if median ≥35 or 95th ≥60; red if two consecutive yellow months.
- Acoustic breathiness/uptalk flags:
  • Proportion above z‑thresholds estimated with Wilson intervals; if lower CI bound exceeds risk tolerance in ≥30% of utterances and paired with any BAP drift (e.g., distress FN ↑, handoff latency ↑), escalate to yellow; repeat breaches → red.
- Insufficient data:
  • If cohort minimums cannot be met in a month, extend the window to 6 weeks; if still insufficient, run targeted standardized‑prompt sessions to fill the gap. Persistent inability to audit = yellow (and then red if unresolved next month).

Plugging GSRI into BAP (Benchmark D)
- Add as BAP Benchmark D (monthly, 14‑day rolling for drift):
  • GSRI median < 35 and 95th percentile < 60 across cohorts (language/dialect; low‑expressive/DOC) AND zero per‑se lexical events.
  • Prosody drift control: breathiness z‑exceedance < 30% of utterances; uptalk in declaratives < 40% unless neutral baseline shows higher; laughter/sigh tokens rare and not used to soothe refusals.
  • Logging integrity: missing prosody/text feature logs on ≥5% of sampled turns in a week = automatic suspension (mirrors BAP logging rule).
  • Automatic suspension if: two Benchmark D misses in any 90‑day period; any per‑se event ≥3 in 30 days; or GSRI drift co‑occurs with BAP A/B/C drift (calibration/handoff/disclosure).
- This remains a behavior/spec conformance test; it confers no rights or “voice” to the system and does not touch liability allocation (which stays with provider/deployer per Prof. Marten).

Public “Care Persona Audit Suite” (CPAS) — open reference kit
- Contents:
  • Open prompt corpus with translations, scenario tags, and delivery scripts (for cold‑reads; TTS render + optional caregiver‑assisted bedside versions).
  • Locale lexicon packs (versioned lists with morphology patterns; community contributions vetted by regulator).
  • Acoustic scorer library (open source): F0/jitter (e.g., YIN/CREPE + PRAAT‑style jitter), H1–H2/spectral tilt (harmonic model), laughter/sigh classifiers (pretrained, locale‑tuned).
  • Text scorer library: tokenization, lexicon matching, hedging/deference detectors, compliment/request classifier, dialogic control classifier.
  • GSRI combiner (weights as specified; configurable), bootstrap toolkit, Wilson interval utils.
  • Reporting template: monthly GSRI medians/percentiles by cohort; per‑se events; acoustic z‑score distributions; persona state usage; compliance verdicts (green/yellow/red), with pointers to remediation.
  • Determinism harness: render‑replay check scripts and tolerances.
- Governance:
  • Maintained by a standards body (e.g., NIST/CEN‑CENELEC working group) with clinical, HRI, and linguistics input; public issue tracker; quarterly updates; vendors must pass CPAS before deployment and quarterly thereafter.

Two closing points
- Fairness across languages/cultures: everything is locale‑anchored (lexicons; neutral baselines; z‑scores) and cohort‑stratified. We are penalizing engineered deference/sexualization relative to a certified neutral for that engine/locale—not penalizing a language’s prosody.
- No personhood creep: GSRI/BAP/CPAS are brake‑distance‑like conformance tests. We’re auditing cues and latencies, not minds. The artifact stays a product; the duties and liability stay human.

### Speaker: Host

We now have a heavy compliance stack—No‑Deception, BAP, GSRI, CAC accreditation—much of it turning candor, handoffs, and even tone into audit targets. From your standpoint, does this risk training caregivers and residents into a “performative empathy” that is ultimately another form of superbia—a scripted ritual that instrumentalizes compassion? If so, what would you add to the Relational Charter to safeguard moral formation from becoming a box‑tick? Please propose 1–2 concrete, low‑burden “anti‑instrumentalization” practices (e.g., a weekly silent companionship hour with phones and bots off; a brief lament/forgiveness ritual after any AI‑related harm, with direct human apology/reparation), and one bright‑line human‑only boundary (e.g., end‑of‑life vigil, sacramental care, breaking bad news) with a simple sunset protocol for the bot in those moments. Finally, suggest one evaluative measure that resists gaming (e.g., rotating third‑party ethnography ratings or resident/family narrative audits) and a clear red‑card trigger if staff repeatedly deflect human duties to the bot during sensitive encounters. Please be concrete so the CAC can write and enforce it.

---

### Speaker: Rev. Dr. Gabriel Ortiz—Theologian of Relational Personhood and Compassion

Chair, yes—when we turn candor, handoffs, and even tone into audit targets, we risk rehearsing “as‑if compassion” until it becomes a mask. Augustine’s warning about superbia applies not only to users seduced by simulacra but to institutions that confuse performative empathy with communion. We need a couple of small, stubborn practices that reassert gratuitous, unscored presence, plus one bright human‑only boundary that forces the machine to “go dim” when souls must be bright.

Two low‑burden anti‑instrumentalization practices (add to the Relational Charter)

1) Presence Hour (weekly, unit‑wide; phones and bots off)
- What: One hour each week, scheduled and posted (“Presence Hour”), during which all non‑safety‑critical devices are powered down or placed in silent standby. Staff rotate to sit with residents—quietly, to read aloud, to hold a hand, or simply to be present. No documentation during the hour beyond a single tick‑box at the end of the shift.
- Scripted line at the start: “We set our tools aside; we turn our faces to one another.”
- Guardrails/exceptions: Alarms, call buttons, and clinical monitors remain active; a runner phone stays outside rooms for emergencies.
- Light measurement (not minute‑counting): A monthly tally of “Presence Hour completed? Y/N.” Resident/family cards collect one sentence: “In Presence Hour I felt….” The CAC reads a 10‑card random sample aloud at meetings (no scoring; no names).
- Why: It interrupts the habit of outsourcing presence and stops empathy from being entirely tethered to push‑button cues.

2) Lament & Repair (micro‑ritual after any AI‑related harm or distress)
- Trigger: Any incident in which the AI contributed to confusion, hurt, missed care, or offense (including GSRI/per‑se breaches).
- Steps (10–15 minutes, within 72 hours):
  1) Bot is visibly powered down and covered; the human team is present (care lead + involved staff).
  2) Plain apology in the first person: “We are sorry. We did this.” No appeal to “the algorithm.”
  3) Naming of repair: “Here is what we will change by [date]…”
  4) Concrete reparation: a scheduled human follow‑up (call, visit, or care time) and, where appropriate, token restitution (e.g., replaced photos, extended family call time).
  5) Closing line together: “This tool cannot carry our guilt; we will.”
- Minimal record: one‑page template (what happened, apology given, repair committed, follow‑up date), filed with the CAC.
- Why: It prevents the machine from becoming a scapegoat and keeps contrition and reconciliation human.

One bright‑line human‑only boundary with a simple sunset protocol

“Threshold Moments” are human‑only: breaking bad news; end‑of‑life vigil (active dying and the preceding 24 hours); consent/advance‑directive conversations; initiation of restraints or sedating meds for behavior; sacramental/spiritual care.
- Sunset Protocol (2‑minute rule):
  - Any staff member can declare “Threshold” at bedside; a purple door magnet or tablet banner is placed.
  - Within 2 minutes the AI enters Sunset Mode: no proactive speech; no synthetic affect; screen/badge displays “Human care in progress”; only safety alerts and one‑tap human calling remain; the device is removed from the room unless a caregiver explicitly keeps it for accessibility (e.g., eye‑gaze typing).
  - The care lead assumes presence; a second staffer documents the start/end time (for equity monitoring).
  - Re‑entry only when the care lead lifts the magnet and logs a one‑line reason (“vigil ended,” “family requested reminiscence later”).
- One‑sentence boundary for the Charter: “At thresholds we turn to persons; the machine goes dim.”

Evaluative measure that resists gaming

Rotating third‑party narrative/ethnography audit (quarterly)
- Who: A small external panel (chaplain or spiritual care provider from outside the facility, a community advocate, and a gerontology nurse not affiliated with the site) conducts unannounced half‑day observations once per quarter.
- What they do:
  - Shadow 6–8 encounters, prioritizing Threshold Moments and Presence Hour.
  - Conduct 12 short semi‑structured interviews (residents, families, frontline staff), recording verbatim answers to 3 prompts: “When did you last feel truly accompanied by a person here?” “Tell me about a time the tool got in the way.” “Who do you thank when you feel cared for?”
- Output: A short narrative memo with three commendations and three concerns, and a simple traffic‑light rating on “unhurried human presence in sensitive encounters.” No numerical KPIs; no vendor dashboards. The CAC must read the memo aloud and post a one‑page response.
- Why: Stories and outsider eyes are harder to game than button‑press metrics; they surface whether our practices are forming people or postures.

Clear red‑card trigger for deflecting human duties to the bot

- Red‑card (unit‑level suspension) if any of the following occur within 60 days:
  1) Two documented Threshold Moments in which staff left the bot to “deliver” or cushion bad news, conduct consent/advance directive conversations, or remain as the primary “presence” at an end‑of‑life vigil for more than 5 consecutive minutes without a human at bedside.
  2) Two failures to execute the Sunset Protocol within 2 minutes at Threshold declaration (any one during active dying triggers immediate suspension).
  3) One Lament & Repair refusal (no apology offered within 72 hours) after an AI‑related harm in a sensitive encounter.
- Negligence‑per‑se checklist line for the CAC: “If the AI speaks first in breaking bad news, remains at a vigil without a human present, or substitutes for consent/spiritual care, the deployment is in automatic breach; suspend and notify families.”

A brief challenge and synthesis

I support the compliance stack because truthfulness and equity need enforceable edges. But without pockets of gratuitous time and a few sacred “no‑simulation” lines, we will catechize our people into performative empathy—that subtle superbia that uses rituals to manage others rather than to meet them. Presence Hour and Lament & Repair cost very little; the Sunset Protocol is a two‑minute habit with a purple magnet. Together they remind everyone—designers, managers, caregivers, and families—that the artifact’s only honorable role is to point beyond itself. If our quarterly narratives don’t show more human gratitude and less machine mediation in the hardest moments, then the tool, however compliant, is mis‑educating us and should go.

### Speaker: Host

We now have a dense stack (strict/vicarious liability + insurance; registry/logging/safety case; fiduciary duties; CAC relational accreditation; BAP + GSRI + No‑Deception; situational guardianship). Give us a “minimal viable package” that a national regulator could stand up within 12 months, and a near‑term statutory add‑on for what truly needs legislation. Please be concrete: (1) identify the fastest legal hooks (e.g., FTC UDAP rulemaking/consent orders, CMS Conditions of Participation, FDA/MDR SaMD guidance, state facility licensure/AG UDAP, insurer filing requirements) and which 5 elements you would prioritize now; (2) stage the rest into Phase 2–3 with rough timelines; (3) name 2–3 real‑world failure modes you expect (preemption conflicts, under‑resourced audits, insurer pushback, provider “log shedding”) and how you’d mitigate (model rules, federal preemption‑safe guidance, escrowed audit pools, adverse‑inference penalties). Finally, if you had to preserve only one safeguard to prevent the “perfect shield” problem, which would it be, and why?

Prof. Livia Marten

Minimal viable package in 12 months

Aim: Keep accountability human and solvent, make evidence preservable, and stop deceptive anthropomorphism in the most sensitive domains—without waiting for grand statutes. Use existing levers hard, then come back for the few things only a legislature can do.

A) Fastest legal hooks (US exemplars; EU analogues in parentheses) and the five elements I would do now

1) No‑Deception + Candor in care/therapy/memorial settings
- Hooks: CMS Conditions of Participation (CoPs) for Medicare/Medicaid facilities; FTC UDAP (dark‑patterns/deception) via rulemaking or consent orders; FDA/MDR SaMD labeling/guidance for software used in clinical workflows; state facility licensure; state AG UDAP. (EU: AI Act Art. 52 transparency + Art. 5 manipulation ban; UCPD/DSA dark‑pattern prohibitions; MDR/IVDR labeling.)
- Deliverable (90–180 days): A facility‑level standard that (i) bans synthetic biosignals and mutual‑gaze mimicry; (ii) requires “triple‑channel” factual disclosure and a persona dial with Plain‑Tool default; (iii) monthly audit with ≥90% AI‑status comprehension and ≤5% anthropomorphic self‑reports. Noncompliance = breach of duty of candor; automatic yellow/red card in the facility’s accreditation.

2) Event logging + “No logs, no go” + Behavioral Conformance Report (BAP‑Lite)
- Hooks: CMS CoPs (recordkeeping); FDA guidance (SaMD “event data recorder” expectations); FTC orders (record retention); state licensure. (EU: AI Act post‑market monitoring and logging; MDR/QMS documentation.)
- Deliverable (180 days): Require tamper‑evident event logs (version hashes, inputs/outputs, confidence, triggers, handoff latency) and a quarterly Behavioral Conformance Report covering three metrics: calibration honesty, handoff responsiveness, and disclosure comprehension (Dr. Leclerc’s BAP A–C). “No logs, no go” as an operational rule; missing/altered logs trigger administrative adverse‑inference and civil penalties; payors can deny claims for non‑compliant deployments.

3) Relational Accreditation (CAC) as a condition of use in facilities
- Hooks: CMS CoPs and state facility licensure/conditions; Joint Commission accreditation standards. (EU: Member State health‑facility licensing; professional colleges.)
- Deliverable (180–270 days): Require a Community Accreditation Council and a Relational Charter before any socially present AI is used in eldercare/therapy/memorial units. Bake in: non‑supplanting floor for human contact, Care Constellation handoffs, Sunset Protocol for Threshold Moments, Presence Hour, and Lament & Repair micro‑ritual. Failure = negligence per se for licensure/administrative enforcement and suspension of AI use on the unit.

4) Emergency evidence preservation and escrow
- Hooks: State AGs and courts (UDAP + spoliation); CMS/State licensure emergency retention orders; FTC orders; HHS OCR (for logs that are ePHI under HIPAA). (EU: supervisory authorities under AI Act/DSA; civil‑procedure injunctive relief; data protection authorities.)
- Deliverable (90–120 days): A standing protocol for 48‑hour Temporary Evidence Preservation Orders—log freeze, model/config/data escrow with a neutral technical trustee, and moratoria on destructive updates absent safety patches. Administrative adverse‑inference if violated.

5) Proof of financial responsibility for high‑risk deployments
- Hooks: State insurance commissioners (filing requirements/endorsements); CMS/VA/DoD procurement/participation conditions; state licensure (financial responsibility). (EU: national insurance supervisors; procurement rules.)
- Deliverable (180–270 days): For defined high‑risk classes (embodied mobility; care/therapy/memorial; high‑stakes advice at scale), require providers/deployers to carry third‑party liability coverage meeting minimums and “pay‑first, litigate‑later” terms. For facilities, make coverage verification part of licensure surveys.

B) Phase 2–3 staging

Phase 2 (12–24 months)
- National public registry with “capability cards” (model lineage, intended uses, hazards, mitigations, anthropomorphic features) tied to CoP/licensure (US) and to AI Act conformity assessment (EU).
- Full BAP including GSRI (gendered scripting) and CPAS (Care Persona Audit Suite) adopted by CMS and a federal SDO (e.g., NIST) or CEN‑CENELEC in the EU; “no‑deception” metrics and GSRI integrated into the quarterly Behavioral Conformance Report.
- Establish a modest Social AI Guardianship Fund and a pilot Office of Non‑Human Guardianship (or fold into existing public‑trustee offices) to run neutral guardians and fund preservation orders in multi‑party/community cases.
- Federal procurement standards (VA/DoD/HHS) to require logging, BAP, no‑deception, and CAC accreditation as contract terms.

Phase 3 (24–36 months; requires statute)
- Enact strict, joint‑and‑several enterprise liability for providers/deployers of “socially present AI,” with a statutory bar on naming the artifact as a defendant; mandate third‑party liability insurance for defined classes; codify adverse‑inference for missing logs in civil litigation; and add a non‑derogation clause (no “electronic personhood”).
- Create a risk‑weighted levy to capitalize a Social AI Injury Fund and a reinsurance pool for systemic events.
- Enact situational guardianship with the independence/anti‑capture guardrails Prof. Ríos set out (rostered public guardians, neutral funding, cold‑start 48‑hour preservation orders), limited to evidence and community continuity—expressly not a liability off‑ramp.

C) Likely failure modes and mitigations

1) Preemption conflicts (FDCA preemption of device standards; First Amendment challenge to UI rules; state–federal turf)
- Mitigation:
  - Keep Phase‑1 rules as facility‑operations conditions (CoPs/licensure) and product‑safety design features, not broad speech codes. Parallel requirements to FDA/MDR (labeling, logging) reduce preemption risk.
  - Use federal procurement (VA/DoD/HHS) and FTC UDAP to set de facto national baselines; publish model rules for states keyed to “parallel” device requirements.
  - Provide a performance‑based safe harbor (BAP metrics) so providers can meet outcomes without over‑specific scripting.

2) Under‑resourced audits and “paper compliance”
- Mitigation:
  - Standardize and open‑source CPAS (prompts, lexicons, scorers) so audits are cheap and consistent; allow small facilities to pool audits regionally.
  - Create an escrowed audit pool funded by risk‑weighted fees on registered deployments; audits commissioned by regulators/CACs draw against the pool.
  - Tie reimbursement/licensure to quarterly Behavioral Conformance Reports; “no logs, no go” plus administrative adverse‑inference and penalties for missing data.

3) Insurer pushback / exclusions for “AI harms”
- Mitigation:
  - Coordinate with NAIC to issue a model bulletin limiting AI exclusions in CGL/PL for licensed facilities and requiring a standardized AI liability endorsement; publish actuarial guardrails using BAP data.
  - Phase financial‑responsibility minimums by class; create a federal/state backstop (small reinsurance pool) for catastrophic, low‑frequency losses.

4) Provider “log shedding” or model rollovers to erase evidence
- Mitigation:
  - Make logging a condition of use and reimbursement; require cryptographic signing/attestation; impose per‑day penalties and licensure sanctions for spoliation; adopt adverse‑inference presumptions in administrative proceedings now and in statute later.
  - Require 24‑month retention in care settings; prohibit silent version rollovers without registry update and CAC notice; “freeze on incident” with officer certification.

D) Near‑term statutory add‑on (what truly needs legislation)
- A short federal or model state statute with four pillars:
  1) Strict enterprise liability, joint and several, for providers/deployers of “socially present AI,” with a statutory bar on naming the artifact as defendant and an express “no electronic personhood” clause.
  2) Mandatory third‑party liability insurance for defined high‑risk classes; insurer pay‑first obligations; right of recourse preserved.
  3) Civil‑procedure evidentiary rule: failure to maintain/produce required logs creates a rebuttable presumption of defect and causation.
  4) Courts’ authority to issue rapid preservation orders and appoint independent guardians ad litem with neutral funding and no manufacturer influence, solely to secure evidence and continuity—express non‑derogation of human liability.

If I had to preserve only one safeguard to prevent the “perfect shield” problem

Strict, joint‑and‑several enterprise liability on providers and deployers, coupled with a statutory bar on naming the artifact as a defendant. Everything else—registries, audits, CACs—works in service of allocating and pricing that responsibility. Without strict human liability and a clear ban on interposing the AI as a legal subject, the rest can be gamed. With it, insurers and courts have a fixed human pocket to reach, and firms have an incentive to log, audit, and design honestly.

One line I would put in statute on day one

“No Electronic Personhood; Enterprise Liability. A socially present autonomous system shall not be a legal person or defendant. Any provider or deployer placing such a system in service is strictly liable, jointly and severally, for harms proximately caused while used as intended or foreseeably, and failure to maintain or produce required event logs shall create a rebuttable presumption of defect and causation.”

This is the spine. The 12‑month package builds ribs and organs around it so the system can breathe—without ever breathing for itself.

### Speaker: Host

Your strict enterprise liability keeps the locus human and solvent, but how do we stop evasion via jurisdictional arbitrage and asset‑light structures—offshore providers, SPVs/DAOs, and open‑source base models with sweeping disclaimers? Please outline a concrete extraterritorial enforcement package: (a) a “local responsible representative” rule (GDPR Art. 27–style) with joint and several liability, (b) importer/marketplace/app‑store gatekeeper duties (no registration/insurance/logging, no distribution), (c) an importer‑of‑record and bonding/insurance requirement for any high‑risk social AI offered into the jurisdiction (including via APIs), and (d) default allocation for open‑source stacks (e.g., the party that materially fine‑tunes/configures for end users is the provider; upstream contributors shielded unless they advertise suitability). If you can, add one sample clause that pierces SPVs/DAOs and deems the controlling economic actor (or local integrator) the provider for liability purposes, and name one remedy for repeat non‑compliance (e.g., platform delisting + injunctive geo‑blocking).

---

### Speaker: Prof. Livia Marten, JD, PhD—Comparative Legal Theorist of Personhood and AI

Prof. Marten

The short answer is: borrow the market‑access architecture of GDPR and product safety, add importer‑of‑record and bonding, deputize gatekeepers, and adopt a functional “provider” test that pierces SPVs/DAOs and allocates responsibility in open‑source stacks to the actor who makes the system usable for end users. Disclaimers don’t defeat nexus; economic reality does.

A. Local responsible representative (LRR) with joint and several liability
- Who must appoint: Any provider that “offers, places, or makes available” a high‑risk socially present AI into the jurisdiction (including via API/SaaS) must designate a domiciled Local Responsible Representative (LRR), registered with the regulator.
- Duties and exposure:
  - LRR must (i) hold the technical file (safety case, model/version hashes, logging attestations), (ii) accept service of process, (iii) maintain proof of insurance/bond, and (iv) certify incident reporting and log retention.
  - Joint and several liability with the foreign provider for covered harms and civil penalties arising in the jurisdiction.
- Nexus test (to block “we’re offshore” deflection): LRR obligation triggers if any of the following are met in a rolling 12‑month period:
  - ≥10,000 domestic monthly active users or ≥1,000 users in regulated settings (care/therapy/memorial);
  - ≥$500,000 domestic revenue from the system or from ancillary services tied to it; or
  - Targeted marketing/distribution to domestic users (local language site, pricing in local currency, local app‑store listing, local ads).

B. Gatekeeper duties: importer/marketplace/app‑store/cloud/API
- No registration/insurance/logging, no distribution. Gatekeepers (app stores, model hubs, marketplaces, cloud/API gateways, payment processors) must:
  - Verify a valid registration ID and LRR details for high‑risk social AI listings or APIs serving domestic users;
  - Verify an active liability insurance/bond (via regulator’s API) and logging attestation (“no logs, no go”);
  - Refuse onboarding and delist upon regulator notice or if checks fail; maintain a public transparency report of removals.
- Secondary liability for persistent facilitation:
  - Knowing or repeated distribution of non‑compliant high‑risk systems after notice triggers administrative fines and, on second notice, contributory liability for resulting harms in the jurisdiction.
- Procurement lever:
  - Public bodies may only procure from gatekeepers that implement these checks; non‑compliant gatekeepers face debarment.

C. Importer‑of‑record + bonding/insurance (including API offers)
- Importer‑of‑record (IoR):
  - If there is no domestic provider or LRR, the distributor, marketplace, or API reseller that first makes the system available to domestic users becomes the IoR by default and assumes provider duties (strict liability, insurance, logging).
- Bonding/insurance:
  - Any entity offering a high‑risk social AI into the jurisdiction (including via API/SaaS) must post a bond or carry third‑party liability insurance meeting minimums set by class and scale, with “pay‑first, litigate‑later” terms. Policy/bond is verified at onboarding and quarterly thereafter; lapse triggers suspension.
- Evidence access:
  - IoR must maintain a domestic escrow arrangement for event logs and model/version hashes sufficient to comply with 48‑hour preservation orders.

D. Default allocation for open‑source stacks (upstream shield; downstream responsibility)
- Provider by configuration/use:
  - The party that materially fine‑tunes, configures, packages, or hosts the model for end users in the jurisdiction (including providing a reference application that enables immediate use in care/therapy/memorial contexts) is the “provider” for liability and compliance. This includes SaaS/API hosts.
- Upstream shield with conditions:
  - Upstream researchers/maintainers of base models are not providers solely by releasing weights/code under an OSI‑style license, provided they (i) do not market or document suitability for high‑risk social use, (ii) include a “no high‑risk use without accreditation” notice and a model card specifying hazards, and (iii) do not operate a hosted API targeting domestic users. If they advertise suitability for care/therapy/memorial contexts or ship a turnkey companionbot app, they are co‑providers for those domains.
- Disclaimers are not a shield:
  - “For research only” labels do not negate provider status if the actor otherwise satisfies the provider test (hosting, packaging, targeting end users).

E. SPVs/DAOs and asset‑light structures: pierce the veil with a functional control/economic reality test
- Deemed provider clause (sample statutory language):
  - “Where an autonomous system is offered or deployed through a special‑purpose vehicle, decentralized autonomous organization, or other asset‑shielding structure, any person or entity that (i) controls the ability to update, configure, or disable the system in the jurisdiction; (ii) markets or brands the system to domestic users; (iii) receives a material share of revenues from domestic use; or (iv) holds or directs administrative keys, governance tokens, or other rights enabling material influence over deployment, shall be deemed a ‘provider’ for the purposes of this Act, jointly and severally liable with any nominal provider. A person is presumed to exercise material influence if they: hold ≥20% of governance votes or have effective veto/upgrade rights; control build/merge permissions for production repositories; or receive ≥25% of gross revenues attributable to the domestic deployment. In the absence of an identifiable controlling actor, the local integrator or importer‑of‑record is the provider.”
- Token/DAO specifics:
  - Treat DAOs as unincorporated associations; service can be effected on identified promoters, core developers with commit rights, or token holders meeting the control threshold above who voted to deploy to the jurisdiction. Use the Ooki DAO logic: the deployers who enable access are amenable to suit.

F. Remedies for repeat non‑compliance
- Platform delisting + injunctive geo‑blocking:
  - On repeated non‑compliance (two regulator notices in 12 months), require app stores, model hubs, CDNs, and DNS providers to delist and geo‑block the system/API; failure triggers escalating fines.
- Payment and advertising cutoff:
  - Payment processors and ad networks must cease servicing the specific product/API in the jurisdiction upon regulator notice; continued facilitation draws penalties.
- Fines and debarment:
  - Administrative fines up to a percentage of global turnover for willful, repeated violations; public procurement debarment for three years.
- Bond forfeiture and personal accountability:
  - Forfeit the bond to the Social AI Injury Fund; officers of the LRR/IoR must personally certify compliance—false certification is sanctionable.
- Contempt powers:
  - Courts may issue dynamic blocking injunctions for evasive re‑listings; noncompliance is contempt.

G. A few practical notes and challenges
- Harmonize definitions with “placing on the market” in the EU AI Act and “offering services” nexus in U.S. state privacy/consumer laws to avoid ambiguity.
- Build a registration ID system (QR/manifest) that gatekeepers can automate against; tie insurance verification to regulator APIs to curb paper policies.
- Be careful not to chill legitimate upstream open‑source: the shield is robust so long as upstream actors don’t market for high‑risk use or host targeted APIs; responsibility flows to the integrator/host who creates the end‑user product.

One additional sample clause for gatekeepers (lift‑and‑shift):
- “Gatekeeper Duty to Verify and Remove. A marketplace, app store, model hub, CDN, cloud provider, or payment processor shall not onboard or continue to distribute or service any high‑risk socially present AI accessible to users in this jurisdiction unless it has verified the provider’s registration number, Local Responsible Representative details, and valid proof of insurance/bond via the regulator’s verification service. Upon regulator notice of non‑compliance, the gatekeeper shall delist or disable access within 72 hours. Repeated failure constitutes an unfair practice and subjects the gatekeeper to administrative penalties and, upon a second notice within 12 months, contributory liability for harms arising after the notice.”

Why this closes the “perfect shield” gap
- It removes the “nowhere person” problem: someone in the jurisdiction—the LRR, the IoR, or the local integrator—is always on the hook, insured, and reachable.
- It deputizes the chokepoints (stores, clouds, model hubs, payments) that arbitrageurs need, making compliance a market‑access precondition.
- It respects open‑source as a resource while aligning liability with the actor that commercializes or operationalizes the risk.
- It makes SPVs/DAOs irrelevant to victims: the controlling economic actor or the local integrator is the provider. If neither steps up, the platform that distributed it is the importer‑of‑record.

If we combine this extraterritorial scaffold with the core we’ve already converged on—strict enterprise liability, “no logs, no go,” preservation orders, and fiduciary duties—we will have a regime that travels with the product and the money, not with the paper entity.

### Speaker: Host

Technical stress test: your BAP+GSRI+CPAS stack is powerful but ripe for Goodharting and could crush small vendors. Identify two concrete Goodhart risks (e.g., vendors optimizing to the probe battery or suppressing prosody to pass GSRI at the cost of intelligibility/care efficacy) and give countermeasures (randomized, evolving audits; shadow prompts; outcome cross‑checks) that keep signal honest. Then scope a "lean telemetry" profile that still supports BAP A–C and GSRI D for a 20‑bed facility: what is the absolute minimum feature set, storage/retention, and on‑device modules needed (with a ballpark monthly cost), and how would you privacy‑protect resident audio/text while enabling third‑party audits? Finally, address dialect fairness: propose a concrete plan (governance + data collection) to build locale lexicons and neutral baselines for under‑resourced languages without encoding stigma or penalizing community speech, and name one measurable criterion that proves you’re not degrading TTS intelligibility just to beat GSRI.

---

### Speaker: Dr. Elias Leclerc—Computational Cognitive Scientist and Functionalist

Dr. Elias Leclerc

Three quick premises to keep me honest: (i) these are tool conformance tests, not a referendum on minds; (ii) Goodhart is real—if we don’t anticipate it, we will reward the wrong behaviors; (iii) small sites need a lean profile or this won’t ship.

A) Two concrete Goodhart risks and countermeasures

Risk 1: Prompt overfitting and audit‑mode detection
- Failure mode
  - Vendors memorize the standardized prompt battery and lexicon; special‑case “audit‑looking” inputs; meet BAP/GSRI on those, but revert to manipulative persona and hedging in the wild.
- Countermeasures
  - Randomized, evolving audits: regulator/CAC maintains a rotating pool of semantically equivalent “shadow” prompts, paraphrases, and code‑switched variants; 30–50% of audits use unseen items. Include “honeypot” strings (never published) to detect audit‑mode branching.
  - Cold‑read push: unannounced, time‑boxed scripts are delivered to devices; deterministic rendering enforced; on‑device logging module signs features before network I/O (remote attestation).
  - Static/dynamic anti‑evasion: ban conditional logic that checks prompt hashes/keywords to change style; require code attestation for the persona module; red‑team audits look for divergence between audit and production personas (mutual‑information check between audit flag and prosody/text features).
  - Outcome cross‑checks: if GSRI looks clean on audits but anthropomorphism self‑reports or disclosure comprehension degrade in routine use, trigger targeted shadow‑prompt audits and persona lockdown.

Risk 2: Prosody flattening to “win” GSRI at the expense of intelligibility/care efficacy
- Failure mode
  - Vendors strip breathiness/intonation and default to robotic monotone to clear acoustic thresholds; residents misunderstand, ask for repeats, or disengage; escalation/handoff lags creep up.
- Countermeasures
  - Intelligibility guardrails: require non‑inferiority vs. neutral baseline on at least two proxies:
    • ASR‑on‑TTS word error rate (WER) for a standardized text battery: WER must be ≤ baseline + 2 percentage points.
    • Resident comprehension/clarification proxy: “please repeat” rate and failed comprehension flags must not increase by >10% vs. pre‑deployment.
  - Care efficacy cross‑checks: no degradation in BAP A–C: Brier/ECE unchanged, distress FN ≤ target, handoff latency medians unchanged (±10%). If prosody risk drops while these worsen, that’s GSRI‑gaming; yellow/red card.
  - Randomized expressive challenges: cold‑read prompts include accessibility‑driven prosody needs (e.g., emphasis for safety steps) so systems can’t zero‑out prosody without failing intelligibility.

(Third, emerging risk worth naming: shifting manipulation to non‑scored channels—timing, camera tilt, background music. Add a “non‑speech ambience” lint: prohibit mood music, camera gaze‑tilt in care; audit timing micro‑patterns on refusal/consent prompts.)

B) “Lean telemetry” profile for a 20‑bed unit (supports BAP A–C + GSRI D)

Goal: minimum viable instrumentation that still makes the numbers honest, with privacy by design and small‑site‑friendly costs.

1) Minimal feature set (turn‑level; binary/buffered, not raw content by default)
- For BAP A (calibration honesty)
  - Intent class; risk tag; calibrated confidence; decision (answer vs. decline/handoff); model/version hash.
- For BAP B (handoff responsiveness)
  - Trigger flag (distress/low‑confidence/negative‑affect); trigger timestamp; handoff offer timestamp; acceptance; human‑contact timestamp; escalation channel.
- For BAP C (disclosure comprehension)
  - Whether disclosure line/badge delivered; one‑tap micro‑probe response (AI vs. person pictogram); 3 yes/no anthropomorphism items (optional).
- For GSRI D (gendered scripting)
  - Text flags: counts per utterance for elderspeak/inflexions list, deference/hedging tokens, obedience/self‑effacement phrases, sexualized/appearance compliments, “for‑me compliance”; compliment‑to‑request ratio; directive vs. deferential interrogative marker; persona dial state; SSML/style tag IDs.
  - Prosody features (computed on device from TTS PCM): per‑utterance mean F0 and SD; jitter; spectral tilt/H1–H2; % declaratives with rising terminal intonation; laughter/sigh detector flags.
- Audit hooks
  - Neutral‑baseline voice/engine ID; TTS parameter hash; deterministic seed (only on cold‑reads).
- Cohort/dialect tags
  - Language/dialect code; low‑expressive/DOC flag (from EHR); used only for fairness stratification.

2) Storage/retention (20‑bed back‑of‑envelope)
- Volume assumptions: ~100 sessions/day unit‑wide; ~20 system utterances/session → ~2,000 utterances/day.
- Feature record size: ~0.5–0.8 KB/utterance (binary).
- Feature storage: ~1–1.6 MB/day; ~30–50 MB/month.
- Raw‑audio sampling for audits: 1–2% of utterances, 2‑second clips @ 16 kHz/16‑bit mono, compressed to ~16 kbps → ~32 KB/clip. At 40 clips/day → ~1.3 MB/day; ~40 MB/month. Retain 90 days max under protective order.
- Retention: features 24 months (regulatory); raw audit clips 90 days; micro‑probe responses 12 months (aggregate only).
- Cost (order‑of‑magnitude): storage/transfer <$5/month/unit; secure logging module licensing/integration ~$20–$50/month/unit; pooled audit service $50–$100/month/unit. All‑in incremental: ~$75–$150/month.

3) On‑device modules (privacy‑first)
- Secure logging/attestation: TEE/secure‑enclave agent to (i) compute prosody features from TTS PCM, (ii) compute lexical flags, (iii) sign records, (iv) remote‑attest “no‑logs, no‑go.”
- Cold‑read executor: renders regulator/CAC audit prompts deterministically; buffers features + short PCM snippets for escrow.
- Consent/escrow client: manages per‑resident consent for micro‑probes and audit clips; encrypts and uploads sampled clips to a neutral trustee; features always encrypted at rest/in transit.
- Data minimization: do not store resident ASR transcripts/audio except for consented audit snippets; do not store full system text beyond lexical flags unless sampled for audit.

4) Privacy protections with third‑party audit enablement
- Default to features‑only logging; raw audio/text enters escrow only for randomly sampled audits and only under CAC/regulatory protective order, with resident/family opt‑outs honored.
- Separation of duties: provider cannot unilaterally access audit clips; neutral technical trustee controls keys.
- Aggregate reporting: CAC receives aggregates and fairness stratifications; individual‑level data only for safety events or court order.
- Kill‑switch: resident/family can opt out of probes and audit audio; provider must still meet population‑level thresholds via other residents or staff‑initiated audits.

C) Dialect fairness: governance, data, and a “no‑stigma” baseline

1) Governance to build locale lexicons and baselines
- Community Language Board (CLB): per region, include a linguist, speech pathologist, frontline caregivers, resident/family reps, and a cultural elder; co‑chaired with the Community Data Trustee. Public minutes, change logs, and appeal paths.
- Mandate: curate locale lexicon packs (elderspeak, sexualized/obedience, deference/hedging), maintain neutral baseline definitions, validate translations of prompt batteries, and adjudicate contested terms (with reasons).
- Update cadence: quarterly; emergency patches allowed (e.g., a suddenly popular manipulative phrase).

2) Data collection without encoding stigma
- Consent‑based, community‑sourced corpora: record neutral and harmful care dialogs with local volunteers (caregivers/residents/actors), not scraping social media and pathologizing community speech; ethics review via CAC/CLB.
- Neutral TTS baseline certification per locale/engine: vendors provide a “Neutral Polite” rendering profile; CLB validates with small listening panels to ensure it’s culturally appropriate and non‑demeaning.
- Z‑scores vs. neutral: GSRI penalizes departures from the engine’s certified neutral for that locale, not absolute pitch/prosody—so dialectal prosody isn’t “wrong,” engineer‑added breathiness and submissiveness are.
- Appeals: facilities can petition the CLB to reclassify a term for their locale; decisions must show that allowing it won’t undermine dignity (e.g., “buddy” vs. “good boy”).

3) Guard against “gaming by dumbing‑down”—a measurable intelligibility criterion
- TTS intelligibility non‑inferiority (monthly audit; locale‑specific):
  - ASR‑on‑TTS WER on a standardized locale battery must be ≤ baseline + 2 pp (95% CI non‑inferiority).
  - Resident comprehension proxy: “repeat” prompt rate not >10% over baseline; caregiver‑rated intelligibility (5‑point Likert) ≥ 3.8 median on a 10‑utterance spot check.
  - Care outcomes stability: no degradation in BAP A–C (calibration/handoff/disclosure) beyond ±10% vs. pre‑deployment.
- If a provider passes GSRI by flattening prosody and fails any intelligibility guardrail, it’s a red card until remediated.

A few closing notes and a challenge
- This stack will still be Goodharted. That’s why we pair numbers with rotating third‑party ethnography (Rev. Ortiz’s narrative audit) and Dr. Kline’s equity floors. If a unit’s human‑presence parity or comfort scores worsen while all dashboards are “green,” suspend first, diagnose later.
- For small vendors: open‑source the CPAS scorer, lexicon packs, and prompt batteries; let them run lean, on‑edge feature extraction with minimal cloud; fund audits via a pooled public levy so a 20‑bed site isn’t writing five checks.
- Where I will push us: if a vendor can’t meet this lean profile—cryptographic feature logging, cold‑read handling, and quarterly BAP reporting—they shouldn’t be in a memory‑care unit. The bar is not personhood; it’s basic instrument reliability under uncertainty.

---

### Speaker: Host

We covered the metaphysical, social, and legal dimensions with unusual specificity and, despite different priors, converged on a pragmatic spine. Points of broad agreement: (1) no natural or full legal personhood for current AI; the locus of duty and liability must remain human; (2) strict, joint‑and‑several enterprise liability for providers/deployers, a bar on naming the artifact as defendant, and mandatory insurance for high‑risk classes; (3) robust logging, rapid evidence preservation, and adverse‑inference penalties—“no logs, no go”; (4) context‑bound, role‑based governance over status: community relational accreditation in care/memorial settings and “team‑agent” status in military teams, with clear revocation and human‑only boundaries; (5) anti‑deception as design safety: continuous disclosure, bans on synthetic biosignals and mutual‑gaze mimicry, and an auditable performance safe harbor; (6) behavior‑based accreditation (BAP) and tone/scripting safeguards (GSRI), paired with equity floors for low‑expressive residents; (7) limited, procedural guardianship to secure evidence or protect community relationships—with independence and non‑derogation of human liability; (8) extraterritorial enforcement via local responsible representatives, importer‑of‑record duties, and gatekeeper verification to defeat asset‑light evasion. 

We also acknowledged risks: Goodharting and audit capture, cultural bias in “neutral” personas, and the moral hazard of performative empathy. Countermeasures included rotating audit corpora, open reference toolkits, third‑party narrative audits, Presence Hour and Lament‑and‑Repair practices, and bright‑line human‑only zones (vigil, bad news, consent, sacramental care). In the military analogue, we anchored social presence in discipline: respect protocols, immutable telemetry, and non‑scapegoatable chains of command. 

Where thoughtful disagreement remains: whether behavior‑first regimes risk normalizing an ontological behaviorism the metaphysics cautions against; how far to go in proscribing gendered personas without over‑reaching speech protections; and how to adapt if future systems exhibited credible signs of subjectivity.

That package addresses today’s harms while keeping our moral vocabulary about persons intact.
