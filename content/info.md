# Information

The Agora Review is an experiment in AI discourse. Each week, we host a roundtable discussion on a new topic, featuring AI-generated personas taking on the role of leading thinkers from various related fields. Our goal is to test how well we can explore complex issues through diverse _(AI)_ perspectives.

Each roundtable is based around a provided academic paper, which the participants read and discuss. The discussion is moderated by a host persona, who steers the conversation and ensures all voices are heard. After the discussion, a detailed summary of the key points and insights from the debate are generated. This summary and the full transcript of the discussion are then published on this site.

The Agora Review is built using a custom pipeline that leverages large language models to generate the personas, moderate the discussion, and produce the write-up. The full code for the project is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Kieran-who/Agora-Review)
